The good lady Virolynn has the weapon you're looking for.  I delivered it to her myself.  You'll need to speak to her Chamberlain to gain an audience with her.
As I wait for word from the High King, speak with King Sebastien - find out all he knows of this Shrouded Throne.
Please help me find my midget.  He keeps wandering off to play with that damn wolf.\n\nI'm so sad without my midget at my side... please find him.
Murk-Watcher has aged much in these last few years. She often seems confused about where she is. \n\nShe can be incredibly stubborn too. Perhaps you could approach her about leaving?
Disaster has struck! The Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma has been stolen by enemy soldiers. I need warriors to strike back and recover the scroll for the Covenant. Can I count you among them?
"Grand Warlord Sorcalin has ordered a scouting mission to Kingscrest Keep. Reports of unusual enemy activity must be confirmed. Dependable warriors are needed for this mission."
"Warriors of the Dominion! Grand Warlord Sorcalin needs volunteers to scout the mine near Drakelowe and return with reports on its defenses.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Our foes are rapidly fortifying their strongholds. Grand Warlord Sorcalin has to know the sources of their materials, so we can hit them where it hurts the most. Scouts are needed to spy on Brindle Mine and bring back reports.\n\n- General Thoron"
"Urgent request from Grand Warlord Sorcalin! Volunteers are needed to scout Roebeck Lumbermill and return with reports on its defenses. Scouts must leave immediately.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Scouts are urgently needed for a dangerous mission. We must know the enemy strength at Fort Rayles before we attempt to recapture it. Volunteers must leave now.\n\n- General Khamagash"

This was no simple robbery. It was grand larceny! And I know who did it. Lafont stole my Glutton!\n\nHe's been itching to put my prized pig on his menu, serve him up in a stew at his wretched inn. Glutton's missing and I just know Lafont took him.
So you say. My sisters and I serve the Beldama Wyrd. We have a duty to uphold. You? I don't know your true intentions.\n\nStill, we could use the help of someone who isn't quite as attached to the forest as we are. You might prove useful, after all.
"We need stone to strengthen our keeps. The mine at Fort Dragonclaw is vulnerable. Take it for the Pact!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"Stone from Black Boot Mine strengthens our foes' keeps. Warriors are needed to take this resource from them.\n\n- General Jeggord"
"Our foes' siege engines depend on wood from Warden Lumbermill. Warriors are needed to capture it for the Pact.\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
The kind that would help fatten Ildani's purse, yours too.\n\nThis one sailed into Sentinel docks before the dead. Guards don't stop the dead, but they stopped Ildani. Locked this one in chains!
I'm hiding. I didn't know the Bloodthorns were going to desecrate this burial site. My ancestors are buried here!\n\nMy great-great-grandfather appeared before me. Demanded I atone for the desecration. If I don't, he said he'd haunt me. Forever!
"For too long, the farm at Castle Roebeck has fed our enemies. Grand Warlord Dortene calls for this farm to be overwhelmed!\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
"Our foes produce siege engines far too quickly. Much of the wood for these weapons comes from Farragut Lumbermill. Warriors are needed to capture it for the Covenant.\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
"We need stone to strengthen our forts. Grand Warlord Dortene believes the mine at Fort Glademist is vulnerable. An attack is ordered immediately!\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
If there are no more attacks, the tree will be fine. \n\nA hunter, <<1>>, came looking for help while you were inside the tree. I'm ashamed to say we turned her away. We couldn't divert our attention when the outcome of your battle was still unclear.
So you say. But you weren't just stabbed in the back by House Montclair troops!\n\nWe barely managed to make it to this tower and set up a defense after the traitorous scum attacked us.
We were working with the wizard Benele. I lost track of her when the zombies attacked. Now I'm the only one left.\n\nThese cultists are desecrating our dead! It's an affront to Tu'whacca. But my wounds slow my sword.
The Red Rooks have taken over Crosswych. I plan to help these people get back their town. I've roused some of them, but we still don't have the numbers to face the bandits.\n\nMy … revenge … starts here. I will find a way to make the bandits pay.
Our enemies cannot be allowed even the thought of being secure. Make an example of twenty of their guards.
Our foes foolishly think that walls of stone will be enough to still our hand. Tear the very walls down around Fort Balfiera!
If we are to defeat the Aldmeri, all under my command must be up to the task. Kill one of their guards and return to tell the tale.
We have received reports of enemy troop movements near the nearby lumber mill. If this is the case we need to know immediately. Go to the Lumber Mill and return to me with your findings.
The Covenant is attacking Davon's Watch. The devils bombarded the northern district. Now they're ashore, preparing to attack.\n\nI need every able hand in the battle to come.
It sounds like her Omen has been twisting the general's mind, convincing him to betray King Emeric. \n\nI suspected the Omen was manipulating events toward that end, but by defeating the ogres, you exposed its plan before it was ready.
It's dying. It was never healthy. This isn't Black Marsh, after all, so in the last few weeks, it's withered.\n\nWe've learned that House Dres is poisoning it. It's not enough to have enslaved us for generations. Now they want to carve our hearts out.
I'm watching the pirates and letting my anger rise like the ocean at high tide!\n\nThe Khajiit must pay for their attack on our village, but my courage hasn't yet reached the level of my anger. I demand vengeance!
You've done well here. We could use more like you.\n\nIn fact, we could use more like you at Fort Virak. The Daggerfall Covenant has seized it.
Ah. Worry not, nothing too dangerous for one such as you. No, it is merely a game with a hint of danger, but a promise of great reward. You merely need to convince three, ah… friends to give you what I require.
The soldier in question, <<1>>, announced himself and his intentions to undertake the Trials of the Burnished Scales.\n\nBy holy tradition, pilgrims who declare themselves may not be harmed. The Hist alone decides his worthiness through the trials.
The Supernal Dreamers took me as ransom when they stole my father's crystal. Please save me from my bondage!.
That is a good name you have.\n\nSo, Well-Named, would you like to help me with a problem?
Bold words, but your Divines can't protect you here. \n\nYour goddess hides in her Temple while Vox wields the power of Oblivion. How do you hope to stand against that?
So many people died! But they remain here, as angry and vengeful spirits.
He's already inside. After he disabled the ward, Walks-in-Ash managed to get some troops inside. The ward came back up almost immediately afterward. \n\nDamn that old Dark Elf's hide!
The mages who first imprisoned Sadal linger here. The portal to Sadal's realm will not open without their aid.\n\nI believe they are angry with me.
He thinks he's a magical genius. To prove a point, he's transformed his brother into a Goblin … a lady Goblin.\n\nThe chieftain of the nearby Shadowsilk tribe has taken him prisoner. He has every intent of taking Dithis as his tribal matron.
Yes. We called in several favors to do it, but we've cracked her code.\n\nIn service to her dark master, <<1>> was after something hidden in a Dwarven ruin. A place known as <<2>>.
There are two people still trapped in the town, a young man and a woman. But the magical fire closes in on them.
Hours ago. We tracked Stral, the bastard, to Vernim Wood. The Reachmen, though, they're not … it's not what we thought. \n\nThe Worm Cult. They're here.
On to our next assignment! We don't get a lot of down time. We're always on the job, always watching.\n\nAre you heading to Mournhold now?
As Vox fled Mournhold, she went east.\n\nWith the recent troubles the Ordinators are on high alert. One of them saw her headed that way.
They're alert, looking for something. Had to kill the one behind me before he warned the others.
I don't have a grand quest to offer you. We're just cold and hurt and afraid for our lives.
Giants attacked Lower Yorgrim. It's a disaster!
The Ebonheart Pact is fighting for control of Cyrodiil against both the Daggerfall Covenant and the Aldmeri Dominion.
<<1>> has been taken over by ghosts who can somehow control flame atronachs. As if regular ghosts weren't bad enough! Ayleid ruins just seem to attract evil.\n\nThe ruins are to the north. Will you help us?
My sister Kireth and I traveled from Morrowind in search of forgotten lore and ancient relics.\n\nThe scholars at Shad Astula laughed at us and the Mages Guild ignores us, but we're going to find something they can't ignore.
Thank you. The gods know I could use your help.\n\nIt's taking all my energy to maintain this projection. The Drublog captured me and my traveling companions. They're holding us prisoner in Jathsogur.
The Worm Cult killed him to fuel their dark magic.\n\nMy Treva, and some of the farm hands … they're trapped, enslaved in the cult's Animus Geodes!
My cousin, on my pa's side. Her father's missing, and the family says Yiri saw what happened. Problem is, he went missing during the attack. But he wasn't anywhere near the west wall.
Just a couple of things, really. Thunderbug hearts from the wild thunderbugs down the hill. And some maggots.\n\nAnd, well, if you want to know, there's something else bothering me.
Oh, it will not be me. Or you, I'm afraid. We extend this courtesy to our Gold Coast friends.\n\nI have a powder that causes deep sleep for many days. Afterwards, the user is too groggy to move, much less fight.
While you were aiding the King, a runner arrived from Fort Morvunskar. The fort is under attack! Fildgor and the Stormfist clan are certainly behind the attack. It can't be mere coincidence!\n\nWindhelm must be protected, but we can't abandon the fort.
So glad you asked! In a word: poison. Well, poisoned mead. Well, over-fermented mead.\n\nHere, just take this brew. It's the key to the door you're about to open.
You're damned right there's something wrong! I needed to sail for Velyn Harbor hours ago. I've got cargo still to load, and crew members deep in their cups around town. \n\nI'd let the guard have the lot of them, if I could afford it.
The Queen's here in town. Her royal guard, the First Auridon Marines, require everyone check in for security purposes.
Shack? This is my home! It's not much, but it keeps the weather off my head. My home is the least of my problems!
The three standing beside me have either failed the Lord of Schemes in life or become bound to him in death.\n\nRedemption calls to each of them. But to win back the Dark Lord's favor, they must first win my game. And no one has ever won my game.
A horde of damn Sea Drakes attacked our camp. They kidnapped Iriana, left me and the rest for dead. Please, rescue her!
Raggedy Elanwe and her impudent son Sorondil. Crazy! Said they were related to Rilis. Hah! Who would claim that?
Would you pray for them? Pray at their grave markers. I want them to have peace.\n\nBut I'm too old to go now. I can't even leave Skywatch.
Perhaps only his remains, but I'd like to know. A local claims to have known a trapper by that name who hunted in these hills. It might have been him, but I'm no fighter and this region is thick with bears.
Another pair of eyes. I need to meet with the chieftain, <<1>>, and my travel will be limited. \n\nBut I can make a glamour—a disguise—for you. As a Drublog soldier, you'll be able to go where I can't.
At the moment, I'm fishing. I was sent to Selfora to get help for Master Raston, but it seems Selfora has problems of its own.  \n\nIf you're not doing anything, go to our trading post and speak to Tevynni Hadran. She could really use your help.
My husband <<1>> ate too many moon-sugar candies. He started babbling to himself, then ran into the forest screaming, "This one likes Bosmer! Plants are best friends!"\n\nI said he'd eat himself sick, but would he listen? No! Typical cat.
I have a heist planned, a big one. Anyone who helps is going to be rich.\n\nBut I need people who aren't local, who aren't in the pocket of Headman Bhosek. Still interested?
<<1>> ordered me to rescue civilians trapped in the Trade Hall and the Mages Guild.\n\nThe Redguards and the Drublog Wood Orc clan attacked. They're everywhere, and we scattered. Even the captain's missing.
Once again, I'm out in the field with the great and powerful Telenger. And, once again, he's trying very hard to drive me mad. Would you be willing to lend that crazy old wizard a hand?
He's just down the hill, probably working on his damned barn. Tell him next time we're playing at his place. Shady bastard.
A friend sent word she was planning a big job and needed help. That's why we sailed out here. Her name is Captain Kaleen.\n\nFind her at the Screaming Mermaid and drop my name. If we help her with her heist, she'll get us off this rock.
With good reason! The undead walk the ruins of Culotte just to the southwest of here. If you'd eliminate some of them for us, I'd sleep a lot easier.
"We can't afford to send more troops to Farwatch. Do what you can to stop the Dominion from establishing a foothold in Glenumbra. Pen them in, but do not engage. Use scouts to gather information."\n\n<The note contains writing in a different hand.>
Bloodthorn Cultists attacked the fortress. You're lucky you don't look like them, or you'd have a spear in your belly.
The Mane … we were escorting him to the handfast, when something happened. He stumbled as we crossed the bridge. We stopped to help him and he … he just went mad. He attacked us with tooth and claw … and something else.
<As you reach out your hands, the room grows cold.>
Ah yes. You're the one he mentioned. He'll be glad you're here.\n\nThe Veiled Heritance were one thing, but the undead are too much. They're Blackroot clan. They were a cruel lot even when they were living, and now, they're even worse.
I paid the ultimate price for my hubris. Three books, each with the same curse. I thought myself strong enough to destroy them.\n\nBut they are a trap for the weak-minded. Listen carefully. Can't you hear them call to you?
You haven't met her, have you? Oh, you'll like her. \n\nShe's one of the last Veiled Heritants. They'll play the antagonists in this story. If you don't change the story, they end up killing the Wilderking. That would be very bad.
"Make no mistake, no one leaves the pack, ever. I want Engitaale found. Scouts reported seeing her near Vlastarus. Bring her to me, dead or alive.\n\n- Geneura"
"Our trip to Coldharbour has gone somewhat awry. I do hope this doesn't prove too inconvenient for dear Lady Laurent. She so expects things to go smoothly.\n\nI find myself separated from the others and in the clutches of extremely beautiful Daedra."
With the combined forces of the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild, we must take the battle to Molag Bal and reach the portal to the planar vortex.\n\nIt all starts at the Chasm. Scouts are already in place, gathering information ahead of your arrival.
I'll hold the gate to <<1>> until the survivors make it out. I've sent runners to muster our defenses, but we're spread thin across <<2>>. We need every available hand if we're going to hold this town.
Followers of Mehrunes Dagon have set fire to our city.\n\nThey've opened an Oblivion Gate, and we can barely keep the incoming Daedra contained. Perhaps our home is lost, but we have to do something about that Gate, or this entire forest is doomed.
Argonians. I can't tell if they're acting alone, or on behalf of the Ebonheart Pact. They struck so quickly I'm not sure who they are, but they took the rest of my group captive and left me for dead.
Let us hope. If they do rear their ugly heads again, we will smite them once more.\n\nThere remains one very serious concern, however. The soldiers we captured say the vicereeve conducted a ritual to raise Prince Naemon from the dead.
Someone in Woodhearth may offer a reward for proof of the death of such a fearsome creature.
Hiding from the dead of Crestshade. By Tall Papa's scratchy beard, I think the town is lost. Some insane Argonian came through and turned everyone into bloodfiends!\n\nWe gathered survivors to escort out of town, but I got separated in the confusion.
<You find a rough map of the ruins. Next to a label marked "Base Camp" is a small note reading, "Report to <<1>> by sundown.">
Queen Ayrenn has departed for Hectahame with as many as we can spare. I have heard dark rumors that a lich has taken residence there, and is responsible for the strife in Greenshade.\n\nThe queen left me here in case you returned. Go to her. Aid her.
Brackenleaf is one of the first trees of Grahtwood, planted by Y'ffre herself. \n\nBrackenleaf's Briars are sworn to protect Brackenleaf from an enemy called the Outsider and accept all who want to follow the path of the hunter.
The citizens of <<1>> are killing each other in the streets. It's … I've seen nothing like it.\n\n<<2>> may need help evacuating survivors. You'll find him by the road, outside the town.
I think you'll like this one. We're offering a contract to take out members of the Shadowed Path cult. I bet you hate cultists as much as I do. Want to go cut some down?
My husband is a talented minstrel. Very talented. We live in <<1>>, but he came to <<2>> to play for new faces.\n\nHe was only supposed to be gone for a few weeks, but after two months passed I figured I'd better come look for him.
I sent three of my best scouts into <<1>> to answer that very question, but none returned.\n\nUntil I know their fates, I can't request reinforcements. But I won't send anyone else inside until I know what happened to my scouts. You see my predicament.
An army of Reachmen is just a day's march from the city, and when they get there, it's not going to be pretty.\n\nWe've done all we can, but frankly I think it may have been in vain. The knights we sent haven't returned or sent word.
Yeah, the Remly brothers. The three of us were hired by the village here to drive off the harpies infesting the cliffs. Those geniuses are supposed to be setting up harpy traps. I'm here to protect the encampment while they work.
I'm not sure I'd put it that way, but yes. Montclair forces have locked the gates and are razing the farms outside. \n\nI sent a small team to find a way inside. We need to know what's going on in there before I order a full-scale attack.
Montclair is here. I have no doubt of that. He hides atop the Doomcrag, behind ancient defenses that he has activated to block our path.\n\nWe need to circumvent these defenses and set up portals. That's the best way to move troops up the mountain.
All of this, it happened because Rivenspire doesn't have a true leader. If that doesn't change, it won't be long before the region falls into chaos once more.\n\nAt least, that's what Verandis used to say.
With King Jorunn and so many Pact officials crammed into one place, the Commander thought it prudent to take precautions. \n\nBesides, it's best to show these apostates what true Nords are capable of. It would be a shame for them to forget.
"Do you hunger for knowledge? The Mages Guild seeks only the most talented, smartest, and skilled for its ranks.\n\nDo you have what it takes? Seek out Rudrasa at the Davon's Watch Guildhall."
No, the lich-lord … er, Naemon was commanding the dead earlier, but he since departed the area. \n\nBefore anyone can go after him though, we must first drive the undead back from the city gates.
Seeking skilled alchemists to fulfill simple requisitions. Your potions may change a life! Carefully examine specific orders as you take them from the board!
We were sent to find Khoruzoth, who's supposedly inside the ruin. His mother hired us. Said we had to save her son.\n\nThere was something about her, like she wasn't totally forthcoming. But the gold she offered was good enough that we didn't press it.
The Hand of Morkul? The long lost relic of Morkul clan? Pride of … never mind, it doesn't matter.\n\nI'm looking for my clan's ancient forge-hammer, but I can't figure out how to reveal the hidden door.
Who. When the anchors fell, I made contact with a priest named Egnatius. He's old … with very distracting teeth, but wiser than most. I'm certain he can help us stop whatever Molag Bal has planned for the city.\n\nUnfortunately, he's been captured.
Kurog summoned the chiefs of Wrothgar to besiege the Winterborn. One of our biggest problems are those briarheart monstrosities. For every one we kill, two more take its place.\n\nI know there's a solution, but damn if it doesn't keep eluding us!
Well, not me, exactly. I came to Wrothgar to elevate my status and here I am running errands for the Orcs. Somewhat ignoble, but what can I say?\n\nAnyway, your assistance against the Winterborn and in recovering their supplies hasn't gone unnoticed.
Oh, just discrediting Grand Chanter Surus and his Society of the Dragon. They claim to be a religious order, but they're nothing more than a cult that loves Akatosh a bit too much. And anyone who questions their faith tends to disappear.
"Esteemed thieves, I need your help. My wealth is vast and my wants are few. What I cherish most is that which I cannot simply buy. Well-lived objects, near and dear to their owners, from all walks of life. It is my last pleasure. Details attached."
I want you to kill Artorius and fill the Void with his blood. Let the Order see what it means to challenge the Dark Brotherhood. Show them what happens when you hunt the hunters.\n\nBut reaching Artorius will require all of your Brothers and Sisters.
"We've got a problem with some laborers coming to a head. They aren't scared anymore, they've started refusing to pay their protection money. Need some filchers to deprive them of their tools as a gentle reminder of who's in charge."
"Got some straitlaced types organizing watches, snitching to the guards, and otherwise making our lives difficult. We need to make a show of our displeasure. Maybe they'll hold their tongues when their own personal items start going missing."
We found you floating in the water. I'd seen corpses with more life in them, but Captain Kaleen dove in and fished you out anyway.
"My kin dishonors our name. Sleeps on watch. Drinks to excess. Makes our ancestors weep in Sovngarde. No punishment has made a difference, so I wash my hands of the laggard. Make it quick, if you can."
"Deadbeats. Such a drain on the books. I hate them. Got a welcher with no means hovering around the Thizzrini Arena trying to con another loan. Settle my account with the scum."
"I really can't take it here anymore. The bugs, the disease, the rain. I'm too sick to leave and too weak to end this miserable existence. Find me in Mudtree Village and throw me to the swamp. Just—don't let me see it coming. I truly am a coward."
Yes. The Night Mother whispered to the Listener and the Listener has spoken. Our Dread Father demands blood.
The <<mz:1>> you placed in the Corpse Garden aren't working. Not your fault—the angry spirits learn to ignore them over time.\n\nI need you to place some more around the tomb. And make an example of the toughest spirit inside. Can you handle that?
A pair of Dark Elf siblings want <<Cmz:1>>. The brother wouldn't stop talking about mechanisms, articulation, and other things I care nothing about.\n\nThe sister was another story. She said the Inner Sea Armature was a good source.
An Argonian tribe in Atanaz Ruins raided their neighbors. Took some old relics, killed a few people in the process.\n\nI don't have a soft spot for raiders. Brings up bad memories. So I want you to go to the ruins and recover what they stole.
That's what I said—a witch! Oh, she might look like a Dark Elf, but don't let that heaving bosom fool you! I agreed to escort her to Vivec City. Then last night she went crazy and started throwing spells around.\n\nShe bewitched me when I ran away!
I'm hearing rumors of more Daedra in <<1>>. Time to banish them, just like you did their friends.\n\nToss some <<z:2>> on their <<z:3>>. Then smash the relics they used to bring them here. While you're there, kill whoever's behind all the summoning.
Ivulen Andromo is looking for someone to help him put some ancient spirits to rest at the Salothan tomb. You up for it?
A giant mudcrab was recently spotted along the southeast coast, near the Shrine of Azura. Large females rarely show themselves, but when they do the Erabenimsun strike.\n\nQuite a prize, if you can kill it. They're deadly—but also quite delicious.
An ancient cliff strider that we call Old Stomper preys upon our people near our camp to the southeast. The older these creatures get, the more crazed and dangerous they become. With most of our hunters engaged elsewhere, the camp remains at risk.
Our hunters must prove themselves by killing a kagouti pack leader. We call these rare and powerful beasts King Razor-Tusk. Due to the importance of this tradition, novice and veteran hunters alike track them to rekindle the spirit of the hunt.
Indubitably, thanks to your efforts. Every rubbing you brought back not only helped complete the model, but it also provided another clue as to the location of the lost library.\n\nWhat isn't present is the key!
"This client is looking for a particular concoction, and stipulates not to ask why. As if we would." — Rolis Hlaalu.
"Notice to all Covenant warriors:\n\nGrand Warlord Dortene has decreed a bounty upon Dominion and Pact Wardens. Slay 20 of them and you will earn a reward."
"Hearken to the heart of Tamriel, the faithful of St. Alessia have returned!\n\n"Our Imperial blood runs true, yet we have seen the tide turn in favor of your Alliance. Please accept our supplication and our blessings at your gate to Cyrodiil!"
The Bloodroot Forge. Legend says it beats and thumps like a living thing, pounding out hot steel with the force of a mountain.\n\nMy kind of place, if it weren't crawling with Reachmen and minotaurs eager to quench their fresh blades in blood.
Initially, I thought we could rely on my ample charms to win us a sponsor. Unfortunately, the people here tend to value craft over the pleasure of my company.\n\nProviding some gift or service seems to be the only way to earn a sponsorship.
"Ready for adventure? The Fighters Guild is looking for strong hearts and stout arms to combat the Daedric threat.\n\nSeek out Aicessar in St. Delyn's Canton today!"
Once every season, the most brave and desperate members of our community make the journey to request a fortune from the Grand Prognosticator.\n\nNot everyone receives a prediction, but many have died hoping to have their destinies changed.
Caanerin, the indrik matriarch, has returned to her ancestral glade near the center of the Isle. \n\nThe last time this happened, she fawned a whole herd of lesser indrik and destroyed half of Russafeld. Obviously, that will not do.
All gryphons are dangerous, but Haeliata and his mate Nagravia stand out from the rest of their kind. To make matters worse, they've developed a taste for mer flesh. We've received reports of them hunting down travelers.\n\nYou need to take them out.
<It looks relatively new, so it likely hasn't been here long. The name "Frynga" is inscribed below its jaw.>
Ominous? No, nothing of the sort. Well, maybe a little of the sort. Depends on how things develop.\n\nThis one has come to Summerset at the behest of Queen Ayrenn. To make sure her decree regarding the opening of the island proceeds as she directed.
A few insignificant echoes and a name to apply to it, but nothing to tell us who created it or what kind of magic it employs. It isn't Daedric in origin, though, despite the false Aldarch's allegiance.\n\nIt's time to utilize more drastic means.
Some bony pit called Fang Lair. Got a ring to it. One of our Trailblazers, Yisareh, says the place has got a mess of necromancers stuck in its teeth.\n\nHow about you work out the unsightly bits with something pointy and show me a killer smile?
Oh, I see. You must be the newcomer the Queen's cat was going on and on about.\n\nIf this threat is real and you actually killed one of the Sea Sload, then I suppose I could use your help. Will you lend your talents to the defense of our island?
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron seeks the capture of three keeps today and you had best not disappoint him! To bring about this crushing victory, all Pact warriors are encouraged to reap their share of the glory!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"

Ah, the tasks are many and the workers are few.\n\nI told many adventurers about our expedition—about the great discoveries and constant mortal danger, but few agree to join us. Odd. Anyway, I am sure you will have better luck.
Cyrodilic Collections can't outfit our expeditions without the generous donations of benefactors. In return, we sometimes perform services for these benefactors. Services related to historic investigation and research.\n\nFor example, take Tia Doran.
I know how a horn works, five-claw, but this is a relic of ancient magic. I do not want to damage it before we learn the true significance of its power. I will have Tharn do more research.\n\nIn the meantime, we have another matter to deal with.
An abduction, to be precise. No ransom, no demands. No obvious suspects or motives. Just a heartbroken father and a missing young lady.\n\nBut that is why Mizzik was hired, yes? He steps in when all other justice fails.
Ah, yes. Mazdurr entered this den of vagrants with the most honorable of intentions. He only wished to share the wisdom of our Lady of Dusk and Dawn.\n\nThis is the unfortunate result.
I told you before, Arum-Khal's phylactery felt different, somehow. Cavernous. Now I see, it wasn't a vessel. It was a gate to another realm. A realm of horror that he controls.\n\nThis Moonlight Blade serves as a gate, too. A door to the afterlife.
We have many eager soldiers in Elsweyr, but most have had little time to sharpen their claws. As an experienced warrior, we could use your help in training our recruits.
"The disadvantaged children of Orsinium require simple furnishings. Craft them, and deliver them to a writ turn-in site.\n\nI request you keep your charitable actions, and mine, in confidence." — R. H.
No, no I jumped out.\n\nSay, I know this is a little sudden, but are you looking to make a bit of gold? Meet me at the Sugar Bowl here in Rimmen. Got some business that might interest you.
Yes, walker. A terror bird needs killing.\n\nThe Baandari call her Wily Kee'va, on account of her cleverness. Old Ri'hirr likes his birds slow and stupid. Kee'va, unfortunately, is neither. Now she's taken to thieving—rustling camels near Scar's End.
A Dragon's words have power few mortals understand. When we swear an oath, we are bound by it. That is our way.\n\nThe Dragon Yahgrondu vowed to aid me in a time of need. We must seek him out and remind him of his oath.
Blademaster Sai Sahan is near Senchal's palace, at the center of the city. Last we spoke, he was trying to secure an audience with someone in the palace. I'm not certain why.\n\nWill you meet with him?
Got tipped off on some New Moon plotting in Deshaan. One of their couriers paid a visit to a nasty clan of Orcs in the mountains southwest of Narsis. Word is they're still in the area.\n\nCatch up to the courier and see what sort of deal they cut.
I do. The crew of the Perfect Pounce already helped us on one Dragon hunt. I'd like you to see if they'd join us for many more.\n\nSpeak to Za'ji and see if he and his crew want to join our order.
Adara'hai came to support her sister through a trying ordeal. Ka'ishka's husband has been ill for a very long time. Adara'hai knew she needed help from her letter, but this one didn't think she meant an exorcism.\n\nIt seems she was mistaken.
When the mine collapsed, creatures attacked from below. Thulsgreg and his wife, Mazog, locked the door to keep the beasts contained, then Mazog hid the key.\n\nWe need to get in there, but making either of them see reason has proven … difficult.
I need a Giant slayer. And not just any Giant, a Sea Giant. Made landfall just today and promptly slaughtered a patrol of the king's soldiers on the coast, save for the one who brought us word.
The University of Gwylim's most prestigious historical society. We scour the continent for lost antiquities, collecting and cataloging as we go.\n\nWe've made hundreds of discoveries, thanks in no small part to our scrying tool—the Antiquarian's Eye.
That, I have yet to determine. But consider what he's wrought thus far—harrowstorms across Western Skyrim to revive the Gray Host. Here, the souls of Markarth reaped to empower the Dark Heart. Both great sacrifices, but I fear worse is yet to come.
Titanborn wanted me to find you and tell you she was on her way, but she had something she had to look into first.\n\nShe said that if you weren't incredibly busy, she could use your help. Mentioned that you had an uncanny knack for solving problems.
This xanmeer stands atop powerful tides of flame and steam. These energies attract many—including, it seems, a Sul-Xan named Flame-Herald Bahsei. She plans to tap the destructive potential below to summon a creature she called, Xalvakka.
Relax, this isn't a matter of life and death. Governor Keshu is throwing a victory celebration at her mansion. I order you to attend!\n\nOh, and grab Calia and Sombren on the way. They deserve a little revelry after what they've been through.
I want to resume our search for the Fourth Ambition. And we should track down the other Ambitions, Sombren and Calia. They need to rejoin us before Mehrunes Dagon's lackeys find them.\n\nI also want to know why Dagon is interested in the Anchorite.
The masked mortal has the right idea. Fargrave sits on the threshold to everywhere. If there exists a being who can decipher this code, we will find them here.\n\nI'd prefer it if we could find someone other than Madam Whim to deal with, however.
Another improvement! I've been trapped in this synchroseisiac state for I don't know how long. My senses, my self—scattered far and wide. I'm barely aligned enough to communicate. I need an intervention to pull me free.\n\nWould you help me?
The great and powerful Lyranth requires the assistance of a chosen mortal. That would be you, by the way. Among other things, I can tell because of the way your hands are glowing.\n\nThis concerns the ongoing threat of the Order of the Waking Flame.
What do you think? Lyranth needs her pet mortal back at the House of Whims. Something about Valkynaz Nokvroz and the Anchorite. I think he's holding her prisoner in his fortress, Ardent Hope.
Dame Madach and I are on a quest to slay the bloodmage who resides within this ancient edifice.\n\nI did extensive research to ready us for the trials ahead … but she forbade me from entering the fiend's lair now that we're here.
How many times must we go over this? Lady A never gives me all the details. It's like she doesn't completely trust me or something.\n\nIt probably involves Lord Bacaro's peace talks—now that no one is actively trying to kill the alliance leaders.
You probably think you know all there is to know about Tribute, but I promise you there's more. Master Razhamad has all the details back in the Bay and he'd love to share them with you.\n\nIn fact, I was about to head back there myself. Come on!
The count isn't one to explain his orders, but I suspect it has something to do with the Firesong druids and their Sea Elf allies. They're holding Sir Stefan hostage after that business at the Draoife.
Dreughside is part of Baron Sorick's fief, but he refuses to send any soldiers. It's crazy.\n\nWe have to stop this before any more citizens get themselves killed. It would help if we got these eggs out of Dreughside and back to the pools.
My mission is clear. No one from the Redguard camp allowed in the castle. I'm a Knight of the Flame and I will enforce that directive to my dying breath.\n\nSir Hughes is the head of our order. If you have concerns, speak to him inside the castle.
My thoughts exactly. And in so doing, you would win her confidence. \n\nYou already helped get the envoy through the gates, so Lakana will be inclined to trust you. Go speak with her upstairs. Do whatever you must to learn her plans.
I don't know. There might be a way to help the other villagers. A group of women showed up as we fled. Threw spells around and called themselves the Wyrd Sisters.\n\nThey helped us escape. Maybe they know what's going on out there.
The leader of the Red Rooks took it. He's a hulking Orc named Tharkul. The box only opens if you're part of the family. I told him that, but he refused to listen.\n\nIf you happen to retrieve the box, it would be worth a lot to me.
Now hold on. Let's not be too hasty. If you want to help, our healer Heloise is low on supplies.\n\nWe had to abandon our carts along the road when the Montclairs ambushed us. Gather the healing supplies and bring them back here.
We have to chance it. We don't have any other options.\n\nA squad of Dragons succumbed to the mist before they could retreat. Then that idiot Darien led a few Camlorn soldiers on an ill-conceived rescue mission and they were overcome as well.
Three locks protect Angof's inner sanctum. I doubt that even you can get in there by simply knocking.\n\nYou need three shard-keys to open the locks. They're well-guarded, so you're going to have to kill a few things to get them.
He's the constable's brother. He saw her dragged off to the mines when she tried to stand up to the Red Rooks.
He's the prince of my stronghold. I left it recently, married a Redguard. Osgrikh swore an oath to Malacath over it and sent those Oathbound after us.\n\nIf he thinks I've abandoned my husband, he's a fool.
I found nothing. The captain went east on his own search mission. He's been gone for some time now.\n\nI need to stay here in case he returns. Would you be willing to seek him out along the eastern road and ensure his safety?
Let's just say he's been somewhat unpredictable. And he see spies around every corner. You don't want to get him angry, trust me.
Each has a thing I require, and you must get all three and then decide which should be mine. What you know of me may help you decide which to give me, but what my friends know may be more important.
Nonsense. The Vanguard is my priority right now. I'm sure one of your abilities can find ample employment elsewhere. \n\nIf you have further questions—and I'm sure you do—speak to my seneschal, <<1>>.
Things that are too important to fall into the hands of the Maulborn. They're in three locked chests, so you'll need to get the keys first.
How good of you to ask. We are fine. Only a few minor injuries.\n\nThere may be some Covenant soldiers left, if you want to kill them. You should speak to Elder Seven-Bellies in town.
There's folk buried under rubble, and fires everywhere. My healers tell me we need to burn the dead. They don't want disease to spread. It's a mess.
Someone has to tell Ordinator Kilao what happened here. You appear to be available for the job. \n\nI'm sure we'll run into each other again. Hopefully, it won't be because your name's on a contract.
Just focus on the task at hand. I've prepared the ritual space, as you can see. Here are the books. Take them, and place them on the pillars of light around the Hall. \n\nThey'll focus the power of the books for the Archmage.
I'm going to rally folks here and in Dhalmora. Get the battle-ready mustered. Send the non-combatants to safety with Darj.\n\nNow hurry. The fate of Davon's Watch depends on you.
Well, the wolves came to Lower Yorgrim after the giants attacked. They roam the streets and feast on our dead.\n\nPerhaps you could collect a few wolf pelts for me. I can turn them into blankets. At least those of us that survived can stay warm.
We guard the ancient burial site of Ouze from those who'd disturb the spirits. But that part of the story's not important yet! You have to save her!\n\nGo along the road. Look for the altar in the water. Please!
Almalexia bless you! I'll follow your lead, but I'm afraid I'm not very good in a fight.
Yes. Reinforcements from Windhelm brought the news. The King has gone to Fort Amol to meet with Pact dignitaries. \n\nTake word of our victory to the fort. Speak to Thane Oda Wolf-Sister there.
To rest and hold council with his advisors, no doubt. Thanes. Ebonheart Pact leaders. Other nobles, I'm sure.\n\nThere's a large camp to the northeast. The soldiers call it Jorunn's Stand. Not far from the place called Skuldafn.
Well, I would be foolish to turn down help, wherever it comes from.\n\nI need certain materials to perform the ritual. Can you gather them for me?
Just so, my friend. Good luck in there. \n\nRaz will rejoin Urcelmo and the others. Ensure Firsthold is still here when you get back.
Too slow for my liking. My advisor Borodin is at the inn, asking questions of the townfolk. My court mage, Golun, has a theory about the Worm Cult's plan. He's at the Mages Guild, doing research\n\nPerhaps you can give them a hand?
My fortress is besieged. Or haven't you noticed? No doubt a plot of the Dark Elves. The dead won't take me. The Elves won't break me. Take that news back to your Jarls!
Yes, Hendil took over my barn. Just the local alchemist. No formal healer training, but he's the best we have.\n\nIf you're looking to help, Stars watch your steps.
Surely. Here's a list of the folk I was still to muster out. When you finish up, head back to the manor house. Check in with the Captain, Landare.\n\nI'll just gather my wits.
You're a gust of wind on calm waters, friend. I warn you, though—this might not be be easy.\n\nThe slavers took the focusing crystals and my combustion oil and we'll need to get it all back before we can relight the fire.
I'm afraid so. His wife, Rosalie, and their daughter, Ganise, are still up there searching.\n\nIf you have the time to spare, I know they could certainly use some help.
Retrieve the totem, rescue my employees, and you will be rewarded. Try not to kill all the Goblins, we need a workforce to be profitable. Use this rotten food to distract them.\n\nOh, and if you see <<1>>, tell him to start looking for another job.
<<1>> will be here soon. She's the lieutenant's right-arm, but she can't be everywhere at once.\n\nCan you get the townsfolk from the Trade Hall and Mages Guild out? Send them here to the Fighters Guild barracks.
We're going to use the ruins to get behind their front line. The Colovians don't know about our tunnel. They've been using the ruins as storage, in fact.\n\nGet downstairs and talk to Herdor. She's in charge. Good luck.
"We sent out the scouting party but no word as yet. Captain Gilame has been forced to engage the Dominion at Farwatch. Without scouting reports, we're fighting blind. Worse, the scouting party consisted of mainly new recruits. This is a disaster!"
You don't fear death.\n\nGood. We could well use one such as yourself. Push the lamias out of this area and we might gain some traction on this damned beach.
But they can't hide forever. I mixed a few invisibility potions in case we had to evacuate. Give one to each person you find. That should enable them to arrive safely.
It's hard to explain. I grew up here. It's a peaceful place. But now it feels … troubled.\n\nThere's a priest investigating in the middle of the grove. Talk to him. I'm getting out of here!
Only this. There is a reason why it is so difficult to unseat a Grand Champion. \n\nBy tradition, it is the Grand Champion who sets the terms of the duel, and even after it begins, she is free to change these terms at her whim.
Yes. Traveling through Valenwood is a funny thing. It may take them many days to find the path to my throne.\n\nYou have all the time you need. Find the Spinner's Cottage and speak to Maruin. Safe journeys, my friend.
He's selling secrets. Dominion secrets. His lovely little resort town is lousy with agents of the Ebonheart Pact and Daggerfall Covenant. \n\nI need to find proof, steal back what he's stolen, and take him out. Will you help me?
An Eye has opened on Arenthia, one of Queen Ayrenn's personal agents. Seek the Wood Elf known as Cariel by the road into the city. And I shall see you again at our appointed hour.
My wife's remains were sent here, unjustly. She was a good woman. I have to come to see her remains consecrated, but it has proven difficult.\n\nI wonder if you could assist me. If so, come to the gates of the burial grounds, and I will explain.
<<1>> runs the plantation with her father. She didn't have much to tell me.\n\nMaybe she'll be forthcoming with someone who isn't a Thalmor inspector. If this was arson, I'll need to know.
"The Daedra have been polite so far, if not a little lascivious. Still, I'm not sure that I can fully trust them.\n\nThey hold me within a tower. I will continue to write these notes and drop them from my window until I am rescued.\n\n-Stibbons"
So many have said before you. But before you hold a sword at this school, you must learn the most important lesson. The one of history.\n\nSpeak to <<1>> and answer his riddles. You'll find him working the forge. After he is satisfied, we shall talk.
Do just that. The Dominion can't afford mercy for traitors. Justice must be served, and swiftly. \n\nHe cannot be far from here. There's a reward out for his head. Find him before I do, and there'll be coin in it for you.
The Artisan targets local Altmer, so I draw suspicion. We must capture the Artisan before the Queen is targeted.\n\nTake my notes.
Just down there in the ravine. It looks like the Argonians have set up a camp there. I followed them this far, but with this wound I'm useless in a fight. Will you help us?
I can read it, but I am afraid to. \n\nI am not like the other Hollow. I can question my existence. I can believe or not believe.\n\nWhat if the book reveals something about the Hollow? Our purpose. I might crack and splinter from within.
Thalara's recipe requires Red Mountain Ash. The mountain's eruption spewed ash as clumps of tuff, yes? If you gather it for Thalara, the reward would be great. Search the shores of Lake Rumare for the tuff.
Treethane Rolon sent me to look for outside help. I don't know what he intends.\n\nHe said something about a horrible crime—I think he thinks the forest is trying to exact justice for something. He's in the sacred cave with the others.
There was a girl, Luala, who left us years ago to study with the Thronekeepers.\n\nSeek her out. Bring her home. There are many here that could use her services.
As we speak, two of my guardians investigate rumored anchor sites. Merric and Aelif are the best the guild has to offer. Meet up with them on the beach east of Vulkhel Guard. You can proceed from there.
You mean … you would go and get the Tear of Anurraame for me?\n\nYes. Of course. If you'll go get the Tear and bring it back to Magister Wulfdis in Shornhelm, that would show the old bastard. I think I could even claim credit.
Travel to <<1>> and look for <<2>>. I've heard she's a reliable captain with a fast ship. She can bring you to the port of <<3>>, which is just south of <<4>>.\n\nAnd if she gives you trouble, tell her I sent you.
Go to the docks within Murcien's Hamlet. Look for <<1>>. If he's still alive, he'll be in charge now.\n\nWhatever you can do for him, you do for us all.
Talk to <<1>>. He'll tell you what needs to be done.
"The darkness grows within me. I have been chosen for a sacred duty. I just wish … my dear Kala. My dear sister. I wish I could see you again in sweet S'ren-ja. I know I can hold this thing here, in the depths. But I shall miss you."
The Daedra cast some kind of ward on the door. A clever but futile gesture.\n\nThe barrier is powered by an Ayleid spell key. A simple relic, easily dealt with. Unfortunately it's being protected by several focus stones. Destroy them so we can get in.
Each day I carry a vessel of the waters blessed in this shrine and feed it into that which flows into the darkened vale. Its strength will remind the earth what it once was. But my body grows weak with age even if my resolve holds.\n\nWill you help me?
No. We should not interfere until we know more, but if you are willing, I would ask that you carry word of this development to Commander Ahla at Bangkorai Garrison. \n\nShe will know best what should be done.
Touch Meridia's light and see the world through the eyes of your former enemies.\n\nBut fair warning—you will no longer be seen as a great champion. Even familiar faces will see you as a soulless drifter, lost in an unfamiliar land. What say you?
We are! Thrill-seeking adventurers, every one. We aren't mercenaries like the Fighters Guild, or patriots like the Dominion. We fight to prove we're the toughest of the litter.\n\nYou want in? You'll have to prove yourself.
Yes. I worry that the Worm Cult may have been meddling in Hakra's tomb, and if that's the case, Lieutenant Slonn isn't the only one in danger.\n\nIf you would go to Pinepeak and make sure all is well, it would be a favor to me and to the king.
They've got a portal in there! Leads straight back to Covenant lands. Won't be long before they can launch an attack on the city. \n\nGet in there and find it. Damned thing is maintained by two crystals. Destroy them and it'll pop like a soap bubble.
We do not know. The Battlereeve sent a soldier, Hazazi, to negotiate with the Bramblebreach clan, but he has made no progress.\n\nNow Raz needs to hunt for the Staff of Magnus. So he asks you. Will you find Hazazi and sort this out?
The Wilderking, of course.  \n\nIt matters not that you understand. It matters only that you go to Bramblebreach and ask how you might be of assistance.
A league of like-minded adventurers. Every one of us eager for riches and glory. Sound like anyone you know? \n\nSo what do you say? Think you can be one of the Undaunted?
That would certainly help. At the very least, we need to know whether the Redguards really mean to attack.\n\nDon't go straight to Sir Hughes though. Look for Dame Falhut at the castle's main gate. Get the lay of the land. They may need your help.
That's generous of you, though I hope you know what you offer.\n\nNerien'eth is more powerful than any lich I've ever encountered. If you're going to help, we should head to his study. He controls these Crypts, and I'll wager that's where he'll be.
Someone named Rana needs aid on Bleakrock. She asked for volunteers, but we've our own problems in <<1>>. No one signed up.\n\nHer boatswain <<2>> is down by the docks if you want to ask about it. Or you can stay here. Either choice means danger.
It understands! The Scaled Court invades our valley. Tricks our chief with false promises. And it's all because of the liar, Agganor! \n\nBurn their standards. Kill Agganor and mount his helmet on a pike. Do this, little goat, and the stones will sing!
The vampire master of the coven is said to savor the blood of innocents. Put an end to him without another drop of it being spilled and you will be worthy of the name, Undaunted.
Now that you mention it, I was hoping to collect a Dwarven power core. But the only one I saw was protected by a Ztheng Guardian!\n\nIf you could get the core, I'd appreciate it. Raynor loves those things! Uses them to build all kinds of devices.
Only if you consider vile beasts, freezing winds, and falling ice to be a problem.\n\nWe tried to climb the mountain three times now, and each failure was more spectacular than the last. If you're interested, Lady Laurent could really use the help.
Gone! <<1>> was a fool to trust him. This one remembers he mentioned his "camp." Why would a traveler have a camp, unless he was a bandit?\n\nPlease, free <<1>>! She has nowhere else to turn.
Here, I'll mark it on your map. Report to General Nesh-Tan when you arrive. She can give you a more thorough briefing.\n\nWith your help, the city will be ours soon. Three protect you.
Old magic. Collect Grievous Twilight claws, anoint them with ritual wine, then burn them in a sanctified brazier. I've placed one nearby.\n\nIf you sprinkle the ashes over our casks of consecrated oil, they should be safe from the Daedra. Simple, yes?
We need to get inside the fort. Find out where they're spawning those abominations. But the damn harpies! We can't walk five steps without becoming bird food!\n\nSiege Commander Dulph's working on a plan. I hope it's a good one—for all our sakes.
The king himself has requested your presence at his private tavern here in Orsinium.\n\nYou must have made quite an impression! You'll have to share your secrets with me some time.
The priest told me how Prince Hew locked his uncle and the necromancers inside the royal tomb. But pirates recently broke in and damaged the seal that kept the cultists from leaving.\n\nI was supposed to fix things, but I'm no match for those horrors!
Before we begin, I offer you a chance to truly impress our dark patrons. Two challenges. Complete these tasks and receive additional rewards.\n\nJust be sure to kill the target. As long as they die, our Dread Father will be satisfied.
Around Wormroot Depths. Off the cultists. Doesn't matter, as long as there's no blood on them before you hand them over.\n\nAnd while you're there, send the toughest Daedra they've summoned back to Oblivion. If you can manage.
The initiates of Rahni'Za prove their mastery by completing five increasingly arduous tests of strength and skill. \n\nI do not know how he did it, but the betrayer overcame the trials and killed Master Timen.
You may call me Nhalan. I was a priest of the cult of the stars in this city when it came under attack by Yokudans from across the sea.\n\nIt was then that we made our unholy bargain: we forsook the stars and pledged ourselves to the Nereids, to Shada.
Here, everything in this performance kit will let you experience for yourself.\n\nGo to Alcaire Castle in Stormhaven and perform for the crowds. They're quite friendly, so don't fear your time in front of them!
You should speak to Councilor Eris. He's opened the kinhouse to interview potential recruits. Freelancers, as it were.\n\nIf you're interested, go speak to the councilor. The longer Veya remains missing, the more distressed Councilor Eris becomes.
East of our village, hiding among the mounds of ash. If you disturb the mounds, you should draw it out—provided it doesn't ambush you first.\n\nOnce the dire ash beetle appears, your skill will determine the outcome of the encounter.
This may surprise you, but the higher I climb and the more powerful I become, the lonelier it gets.\n\nA true Telvanni life always involves some seclusion, but I value our friendship—and Eoki's affection. I'd hate to lose either of you.
The ruins lie to the northwest of Ald'ruhn. Travel to the shrine and slay as many of these vampires as you can. They lair deep below ground where we cannot go, but every death you deal weakens the pack.\n\nRetrieve any relics you find and return to me.
Free her from her minders, so we may grow fat together! Take a token of my love, the sickly-sweet brownish flesh of mudcrab apples, and she will know I sent you.\n\nThe guard cannot know their king bade the abscencing of his bride. Use cautiousness.
There are some, um, "local attractions" that should have what I'm looking for, but they're no place for royalty.\n\nIf you would risk venturing out on my behalf, I'll ensure you play a key role in today's festivities!
<<1>>'s reports speak of numerous rituals being performed by the Worm Cult to summon these Daedra. We must put a stop to them once and for all. \n\nI would seek out Savile before you attempt to do so. She may not have departed Vivec yet.
We were exploring the Bal Fell ruins when everyone left me. I expect such behavior from the hired help, but Stibbons? He's usually more dependable than that.\n\nLocate the mages and Stibbons, then use this signal wand so I can join you.
You aren't at fault for the late delivery, so Fyr shouldn't do anything to you. Won't do anything to you, I mean! I guarantee it!\n\nBesides, I'll let you keep the payment he owes me as well. I'd rather avoid the situation altogether at this point.
Terari Heladren was … ahead of her time. It was fear that led to her expulsion, not reason. I see that now.\n\nPlease, find her. Tell her I'll make it right, if she'll save my life. There is no one among the order I can turn to. She is my only hope.
Good question. I found this memory stone in the grand reliquary. It's called the Eye of Remembrance. Using it near the library pedestals here might show us why these ruins were sealed.\n\nYou look stronger than most. How about you lend me a hand?
How in Oblivion would I know? These Elves have rules for everything—how to eat, how to sleep …. Of course they've got rules about how to beat each other up.\n\nSay, you wouldn't be interested in helping me figure this out would you?
You would have words with that thin-legged sorcerer? Fine! You will find him in the courtyard of the gaudy Elf-Hall up the hill.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have an adventure to return to!
I'm sure the Ritemaster will provide details, though I can tell you it involves the augury spell he plans to cast upon the abyssal pearl that you and Valsirenn discovered.\n\nYou can find the Ritemaster in Ceporah Tower, in the main gallery.
Tamira needs superior dreugh wax and ash basil leaves to create her candles. You can find both in Stonefalls.\n\nOnce you gather the items, deliver them to her workshop in Davon's Watch. Bring me a batch of her candles, and be quick-quick!
Priestess Hodyette. They say that the goddess Kyne has blessed her with the ability to see the patterns of storms, days before they arrive. \n\nTravel to Priestess Hodyette's camp in Eastmarch and implore her to help our cause.
Zamarak wants to help the Khajiiti Defense Force, but he has something he needs to check on first. But you, walker. Your aid would be immeasurable.\n\nFind Abnur Tharn in Riverhold. Offer your assistance against the Dragons.
Naw. The Khajiit don't usually call thieves pariahs, though. This <<1>> earned the name another way.\n\nTo be clear, if you don't find out, you still get paid. Interested?
Right, Lyris mentioned that. Coincidently, a courier delivered a message for you from Dusktown. I never heard of the place, but she said it was sent by someone named Fennorian. Is that your scholar?\n\nRead the message and let's see if he'll help us.
Someone needs to warn people away from Karthwatch. As the last of the jarl's guard, the duty falls to me.\n\nLook, I'm desperate to know if the survivors made it to the barrow. Whatever gold I have is yours if you'll find out what became of them.
Viggol's dog. I trust him to keep Viggol safe most days, but he's getting up in age too. Pah. I should never have married a Nord. Always with the heroics.\n\nWould you find him and go with him? I'll pay you what I can. I just want him safe.
I intended to! I hired this cart and everything. But as you can see, that didn't work out.\n\nMaybe I was foolish to try and do this on my own. I don't have a lot of field experience. Almost none. But you! You could handle this right? I'll pay you!
That's unlikely. The High Priest provided us this relic of Arkay to perform funeral rites on the victims, for the sake of their souls and to drive out any lingering risk of undeath.\n\nCleanse the bodies and kill the vampires. <<1>> can tell you more.
Look around. Hopefully discover this is all just a big misunderstanding. That my mentor Verandis was never a part of the Gray Host. If not, I guess I want solid evidence that he was a monster.\n\nCome on, the cart's waiting for us at Ravenwatch Castle.
I will deal with Rada. After you warn Caddach, find Lady Belain. Defeat her and the Reachfolk will stand a better chance against the assaulting army. And if you can end the massacre, that will stop the flow of energy into the Dark Heart.\n\nNow, go!
Verandis says the Dark Heart's already awake, but it needs more souls to reach full power.\n\nOh, he also said that Lady Belain is somewhere in Markarth. She came to lead the Gray Host army. If we can remove her from the battlefield, all the better.
You'd need to ask her about that. I'm only the messenger. Again.\n\nLook, go to Rebel's Retreat and talk to Arana. I'll wait here for Verandis. He's bound to wander by sooner or later.
No, I have another task for you. Summon what allies you can to Fort Redmane to help defend the Ambitions. I sent my legion ahead, but I fear we will need more warriors.\n\nBefore you go, tell the Ambitions what we are doing and why. They trust you.
He says he found an old letter in Lord Silvelle's study. A letter about my mother. \n\nShe died when I was very young, and I'm not sure how exactly she knew the Silvelles. But I want to know more. What do you think about a trip to Daggerfall?
I simply wish to wade in the rivers that you will change. \n\nVenture through Blackwood. Triumph in a great hunt, see a place that was once forgotten, answer the call of petitioners! Report back once you have made the ripples, and I will reward you.
Calm? I suppose. But I have faith in Lyranth, and she seems to have faith in you. I'll mark the destination on your map. Plus, I secured transportation—the regal Sweet Daffodil.\n\nOh, and take this pendant. You'll need it when you get there.
No? Oh, you're in disguise. I'm glad you're here. Saving Ordinator Nilera and Grandmother—Priest Sovisa's—spirits from Mehrunes Dagon? I can't do that alone! \n\nBut I can give you tribute, um, payment? For the help of an … adventurer.
You must search the Sever for these criminals and bring them back to me. Their leader's name is Bakh. He went through the portal last, and therefore should be easy to find. \n\nHe is a cunning mortal, but he and the others cannot have gotten far.
I may or may not have overheard a thing or two. Something about something you learned from some mad prisoner named Elegian? The Riven Cataclyst hidden atop Annihilarch's Summit?\n\nI suppose Lyranth wants you to assault the summit. Good luck with that!
Fanatical followers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Disaster. While my mistress is merely curious, she has learned that the cult's plans pose a grave threat to the mortal world.\n\nWill you assist Lyranth? She will compensate you, of course.
Jhaka said we should wait until he knows something for sure, but I don't want to sit around.\n\nJhaka is in Marbruk, in Greenshade. I want to go there and talk to him. Maybe there's something we can do to expedite things. Come with me?
A sign that Zenithar desires the baked apples you made and a basket woven from my hands. The blessed awl has been stolen. But, I knew Zenithar would provide and here you are.\n\nWhat do you say? I'm sure Zenithar will reward you as he did before.
As in all things, the best way to improve is through doing! Set out and find new opponents. Win or lose, your skills will grow and your strategies will sharpen.\n\nOnce you establish yourself in the beginner's circuit, return to me for a reward!
The leader of the invading druids is called Devyric. Rumors say he's a real bear of a leader with the strength and ego to match. Plant our banner before you take him out. That'll put him in his place.
Magic, I assume. I noticed crystals drawing energy from the lava. But what do I know about magic? Druids are mysterious.\n\nHey, will you help me? If we stop them from opening more fissures, I can finish my work. I'd pay for your labor, naturally.
They are a proud and fickle lot, but they have one thing in common, dear. They respect you.\n\nGo to the city palace and talk to them. Ask them to remain patient. Then speak to Lord Bacaro. See if you can convince him to let me get things started.
Look at him! We have to break the curse. Druid Fenas is trying to figure out what that entails, but he can't do it alone. I'm covered in bark and Octin's got no body. We could really use some help. Don't make me beg. \n\nPlease.
A knight named Sir Aval—oh, so handsome!—warned me of the area's dangers. I have the perfect solution: trail markers! Just place them along the route and it should be safe as can be.\n\nI'll work out a deal with the Eldertide druids later.
Khenarthi's Roost
The Reach
This quarry on the southern slopes of Red Mountain is the source of the granite being used to construct Vivec City—or it was, until the volcano awoke and began once more pouring lava down its foyadas.
The crumbling Dwarven fortifications of Ald Carac are said to date to the time of the War of the First Council, early in the First Era.
When the new Mages Guild needed a headquarters, they took over an older Ayleid district adjacent to Imperial City and rebuilt its interior as the Arcane University. Though the Worm Cult had taken it over, it was still badly damaged by Molag Bal's attack during the Planemeld.
Scholars who study the long-lost Dwarven race love to speculate on the original purposes of abandoned Dwemer sites. None of them have any credible ideas as to the function of the mysterious Deeping Drome.
In Ayleidoon, the lost language of the Wild Elves, Eld Angavar means "old ironwood." Perhaps the Ayleids hoped such a name would grant permanence to this strange site between worlds. If so, it seems to have worked.

It makes me sad to see the state of this one. The pages are all torn up, the binding came unraveled and some of the ink is in danger of fading.
These metal strips all curve inward from edges that clearly must attach to another component. Resembles a rib cage, I'd say. Probably built to protect vulnerable components while allowing access to talented architects.
Over the years, many artists have imagined Snow Elf attire as being made of fashionable furs from head to toe. Long fur capes, decorative hats, fluffy boots …. The stitching on the sides suggests these were made for clothes.
These are incredibly small. The detail is astounding! I can't even begin to speculate what these might have held together. To be honest, we rarely see such fasteners in Elven apparel. They appear almost Dwarven in their construction.
It's so rare to find Ayleid architectural art still intact! The Alessian Order took a special glee in wiping out Elven culture. I think the only reason there's any left at all was because they were more interested in wiping out the Elves themselves. This beautiful relief pictures the legendary Spire of Erokii while it still stood. Now the inglorious ruins are simply known as Doomcrag. One day I'll convince someone to carry me to the summit to study the spire's remains.
I'm amazed this glass rod has survived intact for thousands of years. It's light as a feather and remarkably hard, thanks to the magicka still clinging to it. It vibrates when stuck into sand. After some experimenting, I determined the intensity would rise and fall in proximity to water. Ancient Elves must have used these to travel safely across the Alik'r Desert. Well, as safely as would be possible, there would still need to be water within a half-day's travel for this to detect it.
This spherical stone eye has numerous winding tendrils curving out from its surface. I've counted them eight times and gotten eight different results. It does faintly emit a Daedric energy, but there's no enchantment that would alter its shape.
Here's a real find! This was a Dragon Cult mask. Dragon Priests believed that they became living vessels of their Dragon-gods' spirits and spoke with divine authority when they donned these masks. An oaken one like this probably belonged to lesser clergy.
There doesn't look to be anything inherently magical about this, but this is no ordinary piece of jewelry. If I had to guess, I'd say it's Nedic. The serpent cradling the stone seems reminiscent of the ones I've seen in Craglorn's ruins.
Mamireh, Akamon, Roshadon, and Rok'dun the Flame, referred to as the Four, were among the most prominent Yokudan warriors of the first invasion of the Nedic homelands. They were Ansei of the first rank, of course, and before undergoing initiation they were required to give up their most treasured weapons. Supposedly, Akamon's sandal-bearer carried the shards of his master's first dagger as a daily reminder of his sacrifice.
Wow! Given the iconography on this pyramid, I think we can safely assume this object predates the rise of the Tribunal! See how there's no reference to Almsivi? These marks venerate the old gods: Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura.
I think we're all in agreement that this is a map of Coldharbour, yes? Take it from someone who knows: Coldharbour is hard to forget.
Our Imperial author omits the fact that Reachmen frequently rebuilt their bows; composite bows degrade quickly in damp climates. However, the sturdy horn or hardwood that forms the end of each limb was often re-used for generations.
Note the use of antlers in headwear. That tradition long predates the observations of an Imperial officer from the middle of the First Era. The antlers are meant to show respect for Hircine, Lord of the Hunt and chief among the Reachman deities.
I presume that the purpose of the rather outlandish shoulder-pieces is intimidation, not armor. I doubt whether a few rib-bones or small animal skulls provide any real protection from enemy blows.
There is no way to tell whether or not this tool was truly used by Saint Kaladas. But given the area in which it was found, its age, and the relatively well-preserved nature, I'm inclined to at least entertain the theory. Kaladas constructed the The Great Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin and some records say he was fond of using highly ornamented tools like this during the process. I suppose it would make sense. Buildings constructed without painstaking measurement rarely last this long.
Teeth! Always a macabre favorite of mine! Most of the time we find teeth from terrestrial or semi-aquatic species in Argonian antiquities, but these look like shark teeth. Maybe these came from an ancient maritime operation?
No small amount of blood on this. Hard to tell if it's Daedric or mortal. Orc and Dremora blood stains the same. Same goes for Dark Elves, I wager. Just be wary about where you store these pages. Banekin can smell blood no matter how old it is.
These bits of metal seem forged to resemble snake fangs. Never a good sign. I can't say for certain, but given the irregular finish and these scratches, I'd say they're a few hundred years old at least. Mid to late 1E, for certain.
What a delicate piece! Crafting links this small would be a laborious process, but the results speak for themselves. It's certainly Elven. Maormer, I should think, based on the pattern and the bluish hue of the silver.
Triangles often appear in Breton art, but almost always in relation to Julianos. Perhaps the looping symbol etched on this book's cover is inspired by the God of Wisdom.
See those little circles surrounding some words? You can tell they aren't original to the book since the ink is slightly darker. Whoever had this book was either very bored or took issue with the author's diction.
The drawings on these pages appears to match the style of master artisan Rumlirdilmo. His later work seemed oddly Breton-inspired. I'll have to compare these against his sketch books.
I've seen these before, I believe it's a very old cooking instrument. It has ridges on the side as if it once fit in to a larger piece. I am not sure I have ever encountered anything that would satisfy, but it certainly is an interesting puzzle.
To think a digsite amidst strong volcanic activity could produce such a wonderful specimen! We know so little about the Vulk'esh, perhaps this petrified egg will be an opportunity for novel study.
Ashamed to say that I almost dropped this. I felt it beat in my hand, like it was alive. Yes, it's anatomically correct, but it's made of hardened tree sap. Outside of druidic magic, I can't fathom how or why someone would make such a thing.
Detailed analysis suggests this clay was excavated from beneath one of the stone circles in the heart of Galen. Druidic practices make regular call for dolmen clay in rituals from the mundane to the fantastic.
Unpleasant, but well worth the discomfort. Clings to skin with a subtle grip, and  spreads itself out over a human body if given the chance. Living ritual implements like this have been rumored for years, but this was my first chance to study one.
Do you think the Sload could have used these for necromantic purposes? Perhaps the unique slimy properties of the anemone aided in their particular magic, and that's why their skill with it is so refined!
An interesting idea, but we may not need to go that far. I surmise these dolls were used to imprint a connection between Argonian hatchlings and the Hist. Notice how the bark still feels tacky? Perhaps it was once covered in sap for early exposure.
Yes, definitely Orcish make. The material looks like coal-hardened potash. According to Thugbo gro-Thutt's "History of the 13 Clans" map, clan Nazhag was closest to reported deposits at the time. It must be from them.
Come now, Verita, this is one of the rare Kjervilde Craniums! A product of the late First Era's most eminent taxidermist! Did you take note of the pristine condition of the bone and the brilliant gold etchings? This is an object of rare beauty!
Is tethering military pomp to religious expression really that odd? For the Yokudans, warfare and religion were practically synonymous! Your comment about the stars does raise questions, though. Ruptga without stars is like Akatosh without a Dragon.
If you're right, we could very well be looking at the spade of a soldier sent to conquer the swamps of Black Marsh during Reman's rule. Apparently he lost more men to the harsh conditions than he did the fighting.
I'm not so sure that this is of Nord make at all. The Dragons of the early First Era sometimes made alliances with lucky mortals, and bestowed arms and armor as gifts to those who fought at their side.
The idea that a cartographer managed to create a map in these conditions defies credulity. Red Mountain's eruption, the end of the First Council's war, the curse of Azura .... An artist probably rendered this as a historical map a hundred years later.
Be careful with these markings. Even the simplest Dwarven bauble, crafted for diversion and little else, can be lethal if mishandled! When the pieces of the torc are joined together, we'll find out what this device was intended to be.
Nonsense! If scholars such as us balked every time a curse was mentioned, we'd never accomplish anything! This upper hoop represents Malacath's blessing of the scourge, by the way. A defense for the wearer.
You were right! This new figure fits snugly with the Mara, but I never expected her lover to be a Man! Is he meant to be Lorkhan? I don't think I've ever seen evidence of Aldmeri culture being welcomed with such open ... arms.
It's said the spirits of Ouze were restless ... maybe that means they haunted the surrounding area? These could have been talismans the locals wore to ward off ghosts! Or to keep the spirits from crawling back out of those creepy tar-pits.
Upon closer inspection, I wonder if these were made ironically. Khenarthi is said to carry the souls to the Sands Behind the Stars. Perhaps she's carrying the soul of someone who indulged a bit too much.
Could this be a famed killing claw of Vashrjo the Killer? He was a famed Pellitine assassin that was rumored to have killed high ranking officials in Anequina. Apparently he'd leave a fake claw by the body so they knew who committed the deed.
It's definitely Ayleid-make, but I doubt they meant for it to look like this. Something corrupted its Aetherial resonance. This band ... it almost feels diagnostic in design. Perhaps this was their attempt to understand the red crystal. To fix it even?
Sort of begs the question: why did a Yokudan warrior who could call a magical sword to hand at will need a scabbard? I guess this could have been purely ornamental. Or maybe having a physical anchor made summoning the weapon easier.
No need to apologize, Gabrielle. Orcs worship Malacath. My people's connections with Daedric ritual ran twice as deep when they stretched this drum. The runes are Malacath devotionals. Grudge-marks. When the warcaller beat this drum, battle was certain.
Mara's mercy, Reginus! For once in your life, can you just appreciate the majesty of what our friend uncovered? Obviously, the sculptor did not have the benefit of firsthand knowledge, but this is the truest depiction of Alessia we've ever seen!
I can't imagine this map will stay accurate for long. Correct me if I'm wrong, Gabrielle, but I believe Daedric realms change as often as their ruling Prince's mood. Who knows what Coldharbour will look like in centuries to come.
Let's not overstate, Amalien. The Kothringi were well aware of gold's value outside Black Marsh. But, it is true that musicality played an oversized role in their cultural expression. Judging by the size, they probably wore these around the waist.
I took some time to reread Elizanev's Treatise on Otherworldly Garments. Apparently, when threaded through a needle and sewn into a piece of linen, this thread will make the linen move and undulate in a distasteful and organic fashion. Horrific!
Regardless of what the knots symbolize, did either of you happen to look at the cord itself? It looks like it's made out of cotton and flax. That's probably what the knots symbolize, two materials they use to make clothing.

What do they want with you?
I can do that.
The blessing of Veloth protects me.

Are you supposed to be?

And the Mage and the King? Where will I find them?

How can I help?
Where is this Aranias now?
You want bodyguards.
The Undaunted? What's that?
Do you have any idea where she might be?
<Take the instrument.>
So he's somewhere in the sewers?

Maybe I can help kill the troll.
I'll talk to her, then.
<Take the ring.>
Where is Vanus?
Where did you hear this about Naemon becoming a lich?

What are you trying to say?
Tell me about the Spirit of the Path.

Being an Ayleid Tract, Translated by Beredalmo the Signifier\n\n"In that (minute or eon) of blood, Anumaril brought (Lord) Filestis the Remnant of Light ('autaracu alata'), and begged him to take it to the cold sunset limit ('fal sorn glathe') of Tamriel. Noble Filestis took the Remnant and, with his (clan or livestock), left Kwyrothil (?) and traveled far. He kept the sunset always in his leftmost eye. Filestis was (followed or pursued) by the Ayleid Emigrants. \n\n"They came to a Land of Cold Rocks and swam ashore (beached? berthed?). The rocks were cold/hard, but the Remnant of Light made all (fertile or wriggling). Many of the Emigrants fell ill, but the Light caused the (rocks or mountains) to bloom food-stone ('culle-anda'), which was tongue-sweet and made healing. \n\n"Filestis desired the Remnant of Light to (smile, glow, warm) all of the Cold Rocks, so the Emigrants, now strong-with-radiance, (raised or razed) a (mountain or pinnacle) to affix it upon. This was (collated?) in eight-hundred-eighty (minutes or eons). Then did all the Cold Rocks bloom food-stone, and every Emigrant was (healthy, impregnated, sharpened).\n\n"After a long time (months-wasted-lying), noble Filestis was (eaten) by Death, and in afterness the Emigrants each cried a blue lake. But his helpmeet took him to the (mountain or pinnacle), where was the Remnant of Light. Then Filestis was strong-with-radiance, and Danced for eight more choruses."
You must secure the Ayleid ruins of Enduum immediately.\n\nNot only will control of this area provide us with a major strategic advantage against the Daggerfall Covenant, but the treasures we plunder from the ruins will add to our resources. And perhaps we can find a powerful relic or magical artifact as well.
The Lion Guard's laziness astounds me. They abandon forts left and right through High Rock, without any regard for strategy or defense. The most-recent location the Lion Guards ran from is Firebrand Watch. Rumor has it the Red Rooks made a fortune when they plundered the abandoned fortifications there. Hurry to Firebrand Watch and gather whatever hasn't been carted off. The Lion Guard's loss must be our gain.
I'm telling you, this ruin has untold treasures! We could even break down the automatons and sell the parts! \n\nHaul whatever you can back to the hideout. We're not leaving a scrap behind.\n\n— Zendrinn
The dogs of the Pact do not understand a contract well made. They see no profit in peace. The only thing they understand is force. Overwhelming force. \n\nIf we're going to take Ebonheart, we need breaches, footholds. I've received word from a scout. She found an abandoned mine near Kragenmoor that might do nicely. \n\nOccupy it. Hold it. Use it. And do not fail me.\n\n— General Alexandra Conele
Butter! \n\nCheese and sausage, milk and honey and baby's breath.\n\nKnotted sheep's guts all filled up with blood. Lashing rain and birthing screams.\n\nWho are you to say that frog wasn't serious? He seemed damned serious to me! Next time, I won't be so kind.\n\n— Kennixa
The Keeper's Primer Volume II: The Binding Stone\n\nFrom the Office of the Canonreeve of Corrections\n\nAltmeri texts reference many variations of the entrapment spell. Some of those spells, like the early First Era "Aninaire's Tower," create physical fields around their targets. These varieties are unbreachable unless broken by an appropriate amount of force—like conjured stone walls, or shield wards turned inward. The effect differs in strength from spell to spell, but is generally effective for containing the layman prisoner, and certainly tougher to break free from than brick and mortar.\n\nOf course, sometimes a mage seeks to confine creatures that walls won't hold, magical or otherwise. Gaseous forms of the Wild Hunt, Nether Liches, and various ghosts and phantoms all have means to escape physical barriers. These must be imprisoned using spells that create completely impermeable surfaces while absorbing or stemming the magicka of their captives. These spells must be re-incanted constantly to avoid consuming themselves, usually at a high cost of magicka for the caster.\n\nThe Binding Stone, which your Head Keeper will soon introduce to you if he hasn't already, functions as a combination of these spells. It's tangible, small, and therefore portable, but capable of holding all manner of magicka-wielding creatures—even ones as powerful as your charge.\nI'm sure you understand the grave nature of what the prisoner's escape would mean, both to you, personally, and to Auridon and Tamriel as a whole. The condition of the Binding Stone is more important than the condition of your prisoner. Indeed, your very lives depend on the upkeep and maintenance of the Stone.\n\nAnd as for your prisoner: do not look at him. Do not speak to him. There is no specific danger in doing so, but any such interaction is a fruitless venture. Watch yourself, watch each other, do your duty, and your name will live forever among those who have committed everything to shield Auridon from his menace.
(a fragment)\n\n- Act VII, Scene II, Continued -\n\nLifts-Her-Tail: My goodness, that's quite a loaf! But how ever shall it fit my oven?\n\nCrantius Colto: This loaf isn't ready for baking, my sweet. It has yet to rise.\n\nLifts-Her-Tail: If only we could hurry that along. How would I accomplish such a task?\n\nCrantius Colto: Oh, my foolish little Argonian maid, you must use your hands.\n\nLifts-Her-Tail: You wish me to knead the loaf? Here?\n\nCrantius Colto: Of course.\n\nLifts-Her-Tail: But what if the mistress catches me? Your loaf was meant to satisfy her appetite.\n\nCrantius Colto: Don't fret, my delicate flower. I'll satisfy the mistress' cravings later.\n\nLifts-Her-Tail: Very well, but I'm afraid my oven isn't hot enough. It could take hours!\n\nCrantius Colto: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.\n\n- End of Act VII, Scene II -
By Aranea Drethan, Healer and Dissident Priest\n\nThere is little chance of our ever understanding the various orders of Daedra and their relationships to the Daedra Lords and their dominions. Of the varieties of Daedra that appear in our world, and the varieties of their relationships to their fellows and their Daedra patrons, there is no end. In one place and time they are seen to be this, and in another place and time they are seen to be the opposite, and in another place and time they are seen to be both this and that, in completely contradictory terms.\n\nWhat Daedra serves this Prince? What Daedra gives orders, and what Daedra serves, and in what hierarchy, and under what circumstances? What Daedra exist in fellowship with one another, and what Daedra have eternal enmity to one another, and what Daedra are solitary, or social, and by turns solitary or social? There are no limits to the varieties of behaviors that may be observed, and in one place they may be this, and in another place they may that, and all rules describing them are always found to be contradictory and in exception to others.\n\nFurther, from whom may we seek answers to our questions about these orders? From mortals, who know little but what they may observe of another world? From the gods, who speak in riddles, of enigmas wrapped in mysteries, and who keep things from us, the better to preserve their dominion over us? From the Daedra themselves, who are never the models of straightforwardness or truthtelling, but rather are famous for misstatements and obfuscations?\n\nAnd even were the Daedra to speak the truth, how can we know if they know themselves, or that there is any truth about them that is to be known, or are all arrangements among the Daedra protean and ever subject to change?\n\nIn short, what is to be known is little and what is to be trusted is nothing.\n\nThese things being said, I shall venture to relate what I have observed and heard of the relationships of the servants of Lord Dagon in my brief service to the Telvanni Wizard Divayth Fyr, when I sought him out and offered to bring peace to the victims of corprus in his sanitarium.\n\nDivayth Fyr told me that he, by choice, trafficked only with two Daedra Powers—Mehrunes Dagon and Azura.\n\nAzura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.\n\nMehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood.\n\nDivayth Fyr said that Dagon's chief servants, the Dremora, were like him in pride, fixed purpose, and lack of subtlety, with the addition of the peculiar traits of honor and loyalty, both within their class and within their relationship to Lord Dagon.\n\nAnd Divayth Fyr said that the Dremora were ordered into clans and castes, and these clans and castes were well-defined. Individual Dremora might rise or fall in ranks, or move back and forth among clans, but only when regulated by complex oaths, and only at the will and pleasure of their Lord Dagon.\n\nThe Dremora refer to themselves as "The Kyn" ("the People"), contrasting themselves to other Daedra, whom they consider unthinking animals. The term "kynaz" refers to a member of the Dremora race ("he of the Kyn").\n\nThe least of kyn castes are the Churls, the undistinguished rabble of the lowest rank of Dremora. Churls are obsequious to superiors but ferociously cruel to humans and other Daedra.\n\nNext in rank are the Caitiffs, creatures of uncalculating zeal, energy without discrimination. Caitiffs are used as irregulars in the faction wars of the Daedra, as berserkers and shock troops, undisciplined and unreliable, but eager and willing.\n\nThe highest of the regular rank-and-file of Dremora troops are the Kynvals, warrior-knights who have distinguished themselves in battle, and shown the deliberate steadiness of potential war leaders.\n\nAbove the rank and file warriors of the Churl, Caitiff, and Kynval castes are the officer castes.\n\nA Kynreeve is a clan sheriff or clan officer. Kynreeves are typically associated either with a clan fighting unit or an administrative office in the order of battle.\n\nThe Kynmarcher is the lord and high officer of a Daedric citadel, outpost, or gate. A Kymarcher's command is usually associated both with a unit and with a "fief"— a location or territory for which he is responsible.\n\nAbove the Kymarcher is the Markynaz, or "grand duke." A Markynaz is a lord of lords, and member of the Markyn, Mehrunes Dagon's Council of Lords.\n\nThe highest rank of Dremora is the Valkynaz, or "prince." This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon.
Of the varieties of other Daedra I encountered while I served in Divayth Fyr's Corprusarium—Ogrims and Golden Saints, Daedroths and Winged Twilights, Scamps and Clannfear—there is much that might be said, but little that is helpful or reliable.\n\nI did note, however, that when Divayth Fyr sought a Daedra of a character like unto the Dremora, but of greater power, and greater inclination for independence and initiative, or solely as a master, he summoned Xivilai, who are like the Dremora in personality and temperament, except that they hate subordination, and are liable to disloyalty and betrayal when they feel they have not been treated with the proper deference and respect.\n\nThe feral, beastlike Daedra like the Clannfear and the Daedroth appear in the service of many different Daedric Powers, and may represent common creatures existing like wild animals in the wildernesses of Oblivion. Other savage, semi-intelligent creatures like Scamps and Spider Daedra may also be found in the realms of various Daedra Lords.\n\nThe case of the Elemental Atronachs, on the other hand, is less certain. Flame and Frost Atronachs, for example, appear to be highly intelligent, but not all varieties of Elemental Atronachs seem to be social or to have the power of speech. Divayth Fyr preferred not to summon or deal with these creatures, had little experience with them, and showed no inclination to speculate upon their nature, so I learned little about them during my time at Tel Fyr.
This is a volume of verse collected from wise women of the Urshilaku Ashlanders. It consists of verses composed by Ashlander warriors, champions, and ashkhans, committed to memory by the wise women and transmitted down the generations. "May I shrink to dust" is attributed to the long-dead poet and warrior Zershishi Mus-Manul.\n\nRise from darkness, Red Mountain!\n\nSpread your dark clouds and green vapors!\n\nBirth earthquakes, shatter stones!\n\nFeed the winds with fire!\n\nFlay the tents of the tribes from the land!\n\nFeed the burned earth with our souls!\n\nYet never shall you have your rule over me.\n\nNever shall I tremble or flinch from your power.\n\nNever shall I yield my home and hearth.\n\nAnd from my tears shall spring forth\n\nThe flowers of grassland springs.
Tillrani, \n\nThe hunters and I can't keep up with demand in the winter months. There are too many open mouths now. (Some of them are wider than others.)\n\nThe town is well-funded by Windhelm. I'm going to take Rana up on her offer to hire outside help during the next cold snap.\n\nA few extra hands from the Guild could mean the difference between eating and hungry bellies.\n\n— Darj
My Stalwart Sister,\n\nThe Three find you well, I hope. I have much to tell you. We've undertaken a full-scale irrigation project on the south side of town. One of the Argonians has shown us how to improve the ditch water system in place.\n\nWe miss you here, Seyne. One person leaving a small town like ours leaves a big gap to fill!\n\nSeyne, know we think of you often. I'm so proud to be your brother. I know you're fighting for the safety of the Pact and that you're making Father proud at Vivec's side. Just remember, you always have a home here.\n\nIf the campaign ends, rest easy knowing you still have a bunk.\n\nFaithfully, \n\nSamel
By Naral, also known as Baretail. The memoir is undated.\n\nMy children, Naral sets this down to give insight into the strange ways of the Wood Elves amongst whom some of you travel. Beware their vengeful ways!\n\nPreparations began months ago for the wedding feast of the two highest Wood Elves. Their union shows that the forest and its people are as one. Hence, a very large feast.\n\nAs a trader, I've often been tasked with providing tidbits for royalty. I name no names, but freely admit to providing biscuits dusted with moon-sugar for banquets in Elden Root on more than one occasion. Still, this wedding feast required many things outside my purview, and I was forced to make last-minute changes.\n\nTo get fifty vats of beef broth, I supplemented the thirty vats available by adding root vegetable broth.  Knowing the Wood Elves are not squeamish about the dead, I provided ten crates of bone marrow from whatever bones were available, asking no questions as to their origins.\n\nBut cake with no flour? Never had I seen such a thing before! I consulted with several Wood Elf bakers who assured me such a thing was possible, as Wood Elves eat nothing green unless prepared by outsiders. Given that, their restriction that I provide cakes without flour flummoxed me. I got a couple of recipes and checked with my suppliers, none of whom could provide the desired quantity in time.\n\nThus, I set about making them myself. I thinned the eggs with water to make them stretch. I added arrowroot and powdered flax seed to thicken it. Sugar proved the most dear component of the cakes, so I added ground chalk to reduce the actual amount of sugar needed. The taste was similar to cake. Very similar. And since they took so little time and gold to make, my profit doubled from the cakes alone.\n\nIt was the substitution of flax seed oil whipped with lard instead of butter that proved my undoing, and the undoing of many a guest's bowels.\n\nNot only did the Wood Elves rescind any future contracts, but they shaved my tail and confiscated all the gear and goods I'd left behind in my hasty retreat.\n\nNever, my children, offer to supply goods for a Wood Elf feast. It will only end in tears.
This damnable war! \n\nSkyrim needs mighty warriors to defend it against the various invaders who want to ravage our land.\n\nWe can't count on our so-called allies to save us. We must rely on our own strength of arms and our will to win the day.\n\nI've discovered a way to make my soldiers more powerful. A special recipe, if you will. With it, we shall become a force unlike any to ever walk across the frozen tundra of Skyrim. With it, we shall become the invincible fist of King Jorunn. No one will be able to stand against us!\n\nBut first, we have some large game to hunt down.

Edhelfin,\n\nIf I never see your blighted face again, it will be too soon. Sal told me all about the "extra" shipments. And don't think I haven't noticed your finger on the scales in our dealings.\n\nI'm giving you a warning as a courtesy. Sal likes you, and he'd mope for weeks if he saw you drawn and flayed. Next port we dock at, you've got one chance to jump ship. If I catch you, you're dead. If I see you before, during, or after, you're dead. Don't tempt me.\n\nYour adoring sister,\n\nElandora
Haldin is dead by his own hand. I don't think he recovered from the loss of his wife and youngest child. Kjora has a bad cough. I don't think it's the plague, but the others seem unconvinced. I won't abandon him just because he's got a cold. I swear, this infernal plague will have us at each other's throats before too long. \n\nWord has reached us of an old crypt, to the east. Refugees from Narsis have taken shelter there, and we've been told they'll welcome others to share the space. I don't want to encounter the undead creatures sometimes found in such dark places, but if our only alternative is to risk becoming afflicted, I think we'll take our chances in the crypts.
I am leaving you, <<1>>, for one who appreciates my talents. My skill! \n\nYou wasted my genius on such trivial things. Chilling drinks. Tricking insects into euphoria so their ichor would not curdle your precious brew!\n\nI created a colossus for you! Tall as a mammoth and twice as strong. Cold as the empty voids of Oblivion! What use did you put it to? The preserving of meat!\n\nI have taken the reserves. I will stir in them a flame so bright the very stars will cast shadows, and from that darkness shall I rise like the sun!\n\nMy only regret is not seeing your face as your world falls out from under you, as mine did that night on Balding Hill!\n\n																																							- <<2>>
By Elgad the Scribe\n\nSome call them a cult. Others say worse things. But the Ternion Monks carry on a tradition that honors the Three Old Gods and the totems associated with them. While the religion is ancient, its followers are few. In many respects, the Ternion movement is slowly dying, as very little proselytizing takes place by the current contingent of monks. Fewer and fewer converts take up the worship of the Three Old Gods, and soon the religion may become nothing but a vague memory.\n\nKnown for their healing magic, the Ternion Monks can call forth aspects of the Three Old Gods. With the help of these aspects, the monks can perform tasks beyond the scope of mere mortal limitations. The aspects take the forms of the Three Old Gods: the Fox, the Bear, and the Wolf.\n\nThe Fox is crafty and quick, and its aspect enhances the speed and agility of the monks who call upon him.\n\nThe Bear is strong, mighty. A protector. The aspect of the Bear enhances strength and shields those who call upon him from harm.\n\nThe Wolf is sly and observant, ferocious and deadly. She watches and waits, looking for the best opportunity to make her move. The aspect of the Wolf enhances vision and perception, allowing those who call upon her to see more clearly, to notice the hidden and the obscure.\n\nThe Ternion Monks prefer nigh-inaccessible spots as places to meditate and worship. Often, the only way to get to these holy retreats is to use the magic of the monks. A guardian is always appointed to open the way to the retreat, but will only do so for other monks or if the need is great and the requester is worthy.\n\nI have spent time with the monks, learned something of their ways and seen their healing magic in action. I believe that they are good people, following a worthy tradition. But I fear that when this generation comes to an end, the Ternion Monks and the Three Old Gods they worship will fade away.\n\nAnd that will be a sad day, indeed.
Tervur Sadri is wanted for the murder of Master Selos of House Selos.\n\nHe is considered an armed menace.\n\nTervur Sadri was last seen in eastern Deshaan. \n\nAny information on the whereabouts of Tervur Sadri should be given to Nervyna Selos.
Nordahl swaggered into the camp like he owned it. Flashed that hunk of metal around like he's Molag's gift to Mannimarco. Bah! Wanted to punch him in the mouth, but Scent-of-Graves stopped me. \n\nRegretting it now, since Nordahl's become more unbearable as the days progress. Wish you were here, sister. We'd show him a thing or two.\n\n— Josseline
O Blessed Spinners,\n\nMy name is Ulthorn, and I am in need of your wisdom. My love has left me. Life is nothing without her. She did not want to go, but it was fate, they said.\n\nI do not believe in fate. How can it exist when a single word can change the path of a story? I have prayed for countless days. For anything—for forgetfulness, for release, for a miracle.\n\nNow I pray to you. Are Gwaering and I doomed to be parted? I would do anything, pay any cost, to be with her again. I would give up a thousand lifetimes to hold her one last time. Please, you must help.
Thulvald,\n\nThe strange occurrences continue. Items have moved around mysteriously or even disappeared completely in some cases. And now the forest itself seems to have turned against us. Maybe the stories we heard are true. Maybe this part of the forest really is haunted. If you can send someone to help us, preferably someone with experience in fighting strange creatures and investigating unusual events, I'd really appreciate it. \n\nOr, if you're feeling adventurous, why don't you come and check on the camp yourself? You might find the experience to be illuminating. \n\n— Logging Chief Jafelma
Day 746\n\nAnother day at the Triple Circle Mine, another half gold in my pay. But I digress.\n\nMy workers are good men and women, devoted and hard-working. That's why these continued stories of strange sounds deep in the mine are beginning to trouble me. Tesa brought me a tale today that I would have completely discounted if it had come from anyone else. But Tesa has always been so calm and level-headed, not susceptible to the superstitions that plague so many of her fellow miners.\n\nAnyway, Tesa claims that she spotted a creature in the large chamber. She said it was below the wooden platform, drinking from the underground stream that runs through that portion of the mine. Tesa described it as a "mouth full of sharp, pointy fangs on two stubby legs." If I didn't know any better, I'd say she had seen a kagouti. I used to hunt the damn things back in Vvardenfell. Nasty creatures! But who ever heard of a kagouti prowling underground in a mine? \n\nI guess I'd better go and check this out. Just in case, you understand.
Those who dare can achieve greatness.  \n\nVeloth the Prophet was scorned by those who were blind to the corruption and spiritual bankruptcy at the heart of their society. Veloth was cast out, cast off, by those with no interest in truth and even less interest in the betterment of all, who sought only to preserve their pride and place by keeping others in poverty, ignorance, and slavery. Veloth was highborn, but he dared to cast off the decadent chains of Aldmeri society.\n\nVeloth the Mystic called out to those whose souls were weary, whose lives were ground out with no hope of improvement in a society founded on ambition, greed, and decadence. To those who hoped for a society that preserved traditions, praised honesty, and rewarded the just, Veloth's voice was as a golden note among a cacophony.\n\nVeloth the Pilgrim led his followers across the seas and away from the lands they had known with the promise of a new land and a better future.
2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n16 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nSenchal, Anequina (modern day Elsweyr)\n\n"What troubles you?" asked Queen Hasaama, noticing her husband's sour mood. At the end of most Lovers' Days he was in an excellent mood, dancing in the ballroom with all the guests, but tonight he retired early. When she found him, he was curled in the bed, frowning.\n\n"That blasted bard's tale about Polydor and Eloisa put me in a rotten state," he growled. "Why did he have to be so depressing?"\n\n"But isn't that the truth of the tale, my dear? Weren't they doomed because of the cruel nature of the world?"\n\n"It doesn't matter what the truth is, he did a rotten job of telling a rotten tale, and I'm not going to let him do it anymore," King Dro'Zel sprang from the bed. His eyes were rheumy with tears. "Where did they say he was from again?"\n\n"I believe Gilverdale in easternmost Valenwood," said the Queen, shaken. "My husband, what are you going to do?"\n\nDro'Zel was out of the room in a single spring, bounding up the stairs to his tower. If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures. But she never suspected the depths of his madness, and his loathing for the bard and his tale of the wickedness and perversity found in mortal man.\n\n19 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nGilverdale, Valenwood\n\n"Listen to me again," said the old carpenter. "If cell three holds worthless brass, then cell two holds the gold key. If cell one holds the gold key, then cell three hold worthless brass. If cell two holds worthless brass, then cell one holds the gold key."\n\n"I understand," said the lady. "You told me. And so cell one holds the gold key, right?"\n\n"No," said the carpenter. "Let me start from the top."\n\n"Mama?" said the little boy, pulling on his mother's sleeve.\n\n"Just one moment, dear, mother's talking," she said, concentrating on the riddle. "You said 'cell three holds the golden key if cell two holds worthless brass,' right?"\n\n"No," said the carpenter patiently. "Cell three holds worthless brass, if cell two—"\n\n"Mama!" cried the boy. His mother finally looked.\n\nA bright red mist was pouring over the town in a wave, engulfing building after building in its wake. Striding before was a red-skinned giant. The Daedra Molag Bal. He was smiling.\n\n29 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nGilverdale, Valenwood\n\nAlmalexia stopped her steed in the vast moor of mud to let him drink from the river. He refused to, even seemed repelled by the water. It struck her as odd: they had been making excellent time from Mournhold, and surely he must be thirsty. She dismounted and joined her retinue.\n\n"Where are we now?" she asked.\n\nOne of her ladies pulled out a map. "I thought we were approaching a town called Gilverdale."\n\nAlmalexia closed her eyes and opened them again quickly. The vision was too much to bear. As her followers watched, she picked up a piece of brick and a fragment of bone, and clutched them to her heart.\n\n"We must continue on to Artaeum," she said quietly.
Dearest sister,\n\nJust like we thought, Father was the one stealing the loaves from the cupboard. Mother yelled and yelled, and we laughed and laughed. We would have laughed harder with you there. \n\nGet well, little sis. Auri-El watch over you.\n\n— Camarino
The town of Riften offers intriguing opportunities for the enterprising rogue, though hidden quicksands lurk as well. The Rift has little fertile ground for our endeavors and Riften is the only locale I can recommend for even a brief visit.\n\nOnce in town, a base of operations can be established at the Withered Tree or Shadehome Inn; both cater to the discerning traveler. A casual perusal of the town will yield several prospects, but I erect the spine of warning. All scouting must be circumspect, with purchase of an item from one of the town's many merchants. For the town guard are active and unusually suspicious of strangers, especially those not of the Nord race. A meandering walk, without a local purchase in hand, will quickly land one in a cell.\n\nThe island that forms the heart of town, surrounded by the invigorating waters of the nearby lake, contains several merchant stalls. A quick purchase there will soothe the guards' suspicions. And it affords a glance at the merchants' goods. These vary greatly in quality and selection, so the stalls of greatest interest I leave to each to determine for himself.\n\nTo the north are two buildings of note. Two merchant families of long standing sell wares not generally available in the island stalls. The Rothalens sell crafting materials, including a few very specialized and rare items. This Dunmer family is tolerated in Riften for the glamor their wares add to the otherwise mundane town. The Rothalens, like all Dunmer, are grasping and suspicious, employing an unfortunate number of guards and more-esoteric security measures. The claw of greed should be tempered with the hiss of caution here.\n\nNext to the Rothalens is the establishment of Guram Ironarm. This retired blacksmith and his family cater to the weaponsmithing and armorer crafts. Virtually all materials needed for these endeavors can be found here, making this shop a destination for crafters from across the Rift. Security here is handled by the Ironarm clan, and a dozen severed hands nailed above the entrance attest to the family zeal.\n\nOn the Guard Captain's quarters and the Fighters Guild we need not dwell, for only the foolish dive into waters so deep and swift-running with no reward in sight.\n\nAh, but the Mages Guildhall, the most impressive edifice in Riften! My claws quiver in remembrance of the treasures contained therein. Spell components, rare scrolls, and powerful magical items—a trove unique in the Rift. Alas, the safeguards upon them are both subtle and deadly. Venture into this building with all senses alert.\n\nAlong the water's edge are the town's docks. While the simple-minded fish from them or gaze into the murky waters, for the acquisitive among us they hold greater delights. Merchants who prefer the shadows can be found along the lower level of the docks, conducting business in the delightfully damp warehouses at the waterline. A purchaser for goods of any sort can usually be found here. The town guard avoids the underdocks or patrols only in large, easily avoided groups.\n\nA grating at one end of the docks leads into a small sewer system. Now used only as a rat pathway, perhaps as Riften grows this will eventually be extended underneath the entire town, rendering it more useful for clandestine operations.\n\nIn the hopes that I may contribute to the expansion of our guild's knowledge, I offer this record of my experiences in the town of Riften. Stay moist, comrades. \n\nRespectfully submitted,\nEyes-With-Intent
I think I understand, now. I think I know why I was left alive.\n\nShe wanted me to become like this. She wanted me to become like her. Perhaps it's loneliness, or perhaps it's something deeper.\n\nI've grown stronger, feeding on the weak fools that pass my lair. For an instant, when I feed, I sometimes wonder if I should let this one live. Truly live, and become like me.\n\nPerhaps I will slip into the town nearby, select a likely target, and try it out for myself. Perhaps.
The soft-skins can't do their dirty work alone, but who are we to refuse their gold? They want to break up some stupid wedding, then help them … but be smart.\n\nThese Elves have different magic than we do. Maybe they can help with the crown. I don't trust that Speaker-in-Empty-Air or her promises. I want assurances if we do what she asks, we'll get what we want.\n\nTurn the Silvenar over to the Houndsmen for their ritual, but keep any other captives separate. I'll question them later. And don't let the tribes fight! We get our way, and the Dominion will be sorry for excluding us.
I parted ways with <<1>> and <<2>> some time ago. They were headed northwest toward a ruined tower.\n\nI've heard of an ancient relic in the ruins nearby. There seem to be some Worm Cultists around. Shouldn't give me much trouble. I'll try for it in the morning.
Penitent, revel in the presence of the sacred ring: Syrabane. The Warlock Lord of the Divines, the ancient source of wizardly wisdom.

Honor to the Warlock-God and the Sacred Ring."
The Hanging Gardens of Wasten Coridale\n\n(This book was apparently written in Dwemer and translated to Aldmeris. Only fragments of the Aldmeris are readable, but it may be enough for a scholar of Aldmeris to translate fragments of other Dwemer books.)\n\n… guide Altmer-Estrial led with foot-flames for the town-center where lay dead the quadrangular gardens ….\n\n… asked the foundations and chains and vessels their naming places ….\n\n… why they did not use solid sound to teach escape from the Earth Bones nor nourished them with frozen flames ….\n\n… the word I shall have once written of, this "art" our lesser cousins speak of when their admirable ignorance ….\n\n… but neither words nor experience cleanses the essence of the strange and terrible ways of defying our ancestors' transient rules.\n\n(The translation ends with a comment in Dwemer in a different hand, which may be translated as follows)\n\n"Put down your ardent cutting-globes, Nbthld. Your Aldmeris has the correct words, but they cannot be properly misinterpreted."
By Rolard Nordssen\n\nThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\n\nAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing - I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to Hammerfell, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\n\nBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\n\nExcept … it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping - the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\n\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\n\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden king would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.
Third Edition\n\nBy the Council of Healers, Imperial University\n\nAfter much analysis of living specimens, the Council long ago determined that all "races" of Elves and Humans may mate with each other and bear fertile offspring. Generally the offspring bear the racial traits of the mother, though some traces of the father's race may also be present. It is less clear whether the Argonians and Khajiit are interfertile with both Humans and Elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of children from these unions, as well as stories of unions with Daedra, there have been no well documented offspring. Khajiit differ from Humans and Elves in not only their skeletal and dermal physiology—the "fur" that covers their bodies—but their metabolism and digestion as well. Argonians, like the dreugh, appear to be a semi-aquatic troglophile form of humans, though it is by no means clear whether the Argonians should be classified with dreugh, men, mer, or (in this author's opinion), certain tree-dwelling lizards in Black Marsh.\n\nThe reproductive biology of Orcs is at present not well understood, and the same is true of Goblins, trolls, harpies, dreugh, Tsaesci, Imga, various Daedra and many others. Certainly, there have been cases of intercourse between these "races," generally in the nature of rape or magical seduction, but there have been no documented cases of pregnancy. Still, the interfertility of these creatures and the civilized hominids has yet to be empirically established or refuted, likely due to the deep cultural differences. Surely any normal Bosmer or Breton impregnated by an Orc would keep that shame to herself, and there's no reason to suppose that an Orc maiden impregnated by a human would not be likewise ostracized by her society. Regrettably, our oaths as healers keep us from forcing a coupling to satisfy our scientific knowledge. We do know, however, that the Sload of Thras are hermaphrodites in their youth and later reabsorb their reproductive organs once they are old enough to move about on land. It can be safely assumed that they are not interfertile with men or mer.\n\nOne might further wonder whether the proper classification of these same "races," to use the imprecise but useful term, should be made from the assumption of a common heritage and the differences between them have arisen from magical experimentation, the manipulations of the so-called "Earth Bones," or from gradual changes from one generation to the next.
Dear Diary,\n\nIt's been a while since the last time I wrote, but it's not like a lot happens around here. Sure, the villagers say that their friends and family members have gone missing, but my father says they probably just left to avoid the plague. Oh, right, and then there's the Llodos plague, but I'm not too worried about that, either. My father's the House Minister! He won't let anyone that's part of House Hlaalu get sick, especially not his darling daughter. (That's me!)\n\nI saw a recruiting pamphlet for the Maulborn today. They were distributing them outside the gates of town. They say they're here to help, but I think there's something creepy about them. And I certainly don't like the outfits they make all their members wear. It's like they're some kind of an army or something. Still, there were a couple of cute-looking members wandering around down by the lake. I wonder what they like to do for fun when they're not saving the world? Maybe I'll sneak down there one night and take a look.\n\nThere's a stranger in town. Finally, someone interesting to talk to! I can't wait to talk to the stranger. Hear about news from distant lands, listen to stories of thrilling adventures and forbidden romance. Maybe my father will let me invite the stranger over for dinner. That would be exciting! But it would be more exciting if we could go somewhere quiet, just the two of us. I need to think about that. I'm sure I can work out a way to make that happen.\n\nI'll tell you all about it next time, Diary!\n\n— Vim Hlaalu
Part Four\n\nI remember thinking, as we slid into the massive whirlpool, that my mates and I would never see Alten Corimont again. I was right, but not in the way I thought. The truth was even worse.\n\nAs we were sucked into the pulsing blue light beneath the maelstrom, I felt water rush over my scales. Before the sea could consume me, a gale of cold wind exploded from below. We were no longer sinking—we were falling! As I clung to the deck, I saw that the whirling wall of water had been replaced by a dark, haunted sky and an infinite expanse of cold, dead earth. And it was rushing to meet us as we fell.\n\nI blacked out, waking up some time later on the deck. I remember seeing the Captain talking to what appeared to be a great beast. I remember the beast handing the Captain something and then I blacked out again.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was transformed. My scales and skin were gone—I was nought but bones. The Captain was now the Admiral, and whatever he commanded we could not refuse. More ships fell from the sky, and our Lost Fleet grew. We put the Era back together, dug tunnels, and constructed a town from the wreckage of the other ships, all at the Admiral's command.\n\nWe hate him, but we cannot disobey him. It's that crown he wears. I pray that one day someone who can resist the Admiral finds this journal. This journal, and the key I have hidden within its pages.

Captain Jardirr,\n\nIn recognition of your dedicated service to the Ebonheart Pact, it is with pride and pleasure that I award this Letter of Commendation. Reports from the Dark Elf and Argonian members of your unit make it clear you take the mission of the Pact to heart and mind.\n\nKeep this up and you'll be Centurion before this war is over. For the Pact and Glory!\n\n— Holgunn One-Eye, Stonefalls Command
Tryn,\n\nSoon, you're going to hear very bad things about me. I wish I could tell you they weren't true. But they are. All I can say is that I know I did wrong.\n\nI know you're disappointed. I can't ever make this up to you, but please, remember I love you. And I'm sorry.\n\n—	Mother

I am not a writer. I am a thief. I am a good thief. I am not such a good writer. Anyway, I want to write about picking locks. I read a book about designing locks once. It was good. It gave me lots of ideas.\n \nSome guys make locks with angled keyholes. Always carry a bent lockpick. They will work good in these locks. I do, and I open lots of locks. Sometimes I carry copper lockpicks. Copper bends easy. That way I can bend it right there. Copper lockpicks break easy too. Be careful.\n \nSometimes the locks have weird springs. They all spring differently, which makes picking it hard. I hold my torch close to the lock. This makes it hot. When it's hot, the springs are all the same. They don't bounce so differently any more. Be careful not to burn yourself.\n \nSome thieves can't read. If you can't read, get someone to read this book to you. It will make more sense then.
By Anonymous\n\nThe next day, he did return with more questions, these ones very specific. He wanted to know about the vampires of eastern Skyrim. I told him about the most powerful tribe, the Volkihar, paranoid and cruel, whose very breath could freeze their victims' blood in the veins. I explained to him how they lived beneath the ice of remote and haunted lakes, never venturing into the world of men except to feed.\n \nMovarth Piquine listened carefully, and asked more questions into the night, until at last he was ready to leave.\n \n"I will not see you for a few days," he said. "But I will return, and tell you how helpful your information has been."\n \nTrue to his word, the man returned to my chapel shortly after midnight four days later. There was a fresh scar on his cheek, but he was smiling that grim but satisfied smile of his.\n \n"Your advice helped me very much," he said. "But you should know that the Volkihar have an additional ability you didn't mention. They can reach through the ice of their lakes without breaking it. It was quite a nasty surprise, being grabbed from below without any warning."\n \n"How remarkable," I said with a laugh. "And terrifying. You're lucky you survived."\n \n"I don't believe in luck. I believe in knowledge and training. Your information helped me, and my skill at melee combat sealed the bloodsucker's fate. I've never believed in weaponry of any kind. Too many unknowns. Even the best swordsmith has created a flawed blade, but you know what your body is capable of. I know I can land a thousand blows without losing my balance, provided I get the first strike."\n \n"The first strike?" I murmured. "So you must never be surprised."\n \n"That is why I came to you," said Movarth. "You know more than anyone alive about these monsters, in all their cursed varieties across the land. Now you must tell me about the vampires of northern Valenwood."\n \nI did as he asked, and once again, his questions taxed my knowledge. There were many tribes to cover. The Bonsamu who were indistinguishable from Bosmer except when seen by candlelight. The Keerilth who could disintegrate into mist. The Yekef who swallowed men whole. The dread Telboth who preyed on children, eventually taking their place in the family, waiting patiently for years before murdering them all in their unnatural hunger.\n \nOnce again, he bade me farewell, promising to return in a few weeks, and once again, he returned as he said, just after midnight. This time, Movarth had no fresh scars, but he again had new information.\n \n"You were wrong about the Keerilth being unable to vaporize when pushed underwater," he said, patting my shoulder fondly. "Fortunately, they cannot travel far in their mist form, and I was able to track it down."\n \n"You must have surprised it fearfully. Your field knowledge is becoming impressive," I said. "I should have had an acolyte like you decades ago."\n \n"Now, tell me," he said. "Of the vampires of Cyrodiil."\n \nI told him what I could. There was but one tribe in Cyrodiil, a powerful clan who had ousted all other competitors, much like the Imperials themselves had done. Their true name was unknown, lost in history, but they were experts at concealment. If they kept themselves well-fed, they were indistinguishable from living persons. They were cultured, more civilized than the vampires of the provinces, preferring to feed on victims while they were asleep, unaware.\n \n"They will be difficult to surprise," Movarth frowned. "But I will seek one out, and tell you what I learn. And then you will tell me of the vampires of High Rock, and Hammerfell, and Elsweyr, and Black Marsh, and Morrowind, and the Summerset Isles, yes?"\n \nI nodded, knowing then that this was a man on an eternal quest. He wouldn't be satisfied with but the barest hint of how things were. He needed to know it all.\n \nHe did not return for a month, and on the night that he did, I could see his frustration and despair, though there were no lights burning in my chapel.\n \n"I failed," he said, as I lit a candle. "You were right. I could not find a single one."\n \nI brought the light up to my face and smiled. He was surprised, even stunned by the pallor of my flesh, the dark hunger in my ageless eyes, and the teeth. Oh, yes, I think the teeth definitely surprised the man who could not afford to be surprised.\n \n"I haven't fed in seventy-two hours," I explained, as I fell on him. He did not land the first blow or the last.
Jagga:\n\nSet several shallow pans of boiled pig's milk cream where the cat can't step on them and leave alone for a day, then stir several times per day thereafter.\n\nStrain the whey into a separate vessel, keeping the curds in their pans. Break the curds apart with a spoon, then allow the curds to dry into shards.\n\nStir daily to keep them from spoiling. Once dry, use these shards to thicken skimmed pig's milk, or to add more cream to plain pig's milk.\n\nBottle and let ferment for 3 weeks. \n\nNote that you can drink the whey immediately, or use it in other recipes.\n\nBlood Froth:\n\nPour fresh blood into shallow pans and place in the cold cave till nearly congealed. Meanwhile, whip together a couple of chicken egg yolks and melted tallow.\n\nUsing a sharp knife, slice the blood into chunks, then dice. This is why you let it congeal first—it's impossible to dice fresh blood!\n\nWhip the blood slivers with the yolks and tallow, adding more tallow if needed to thin into a beverage. Add salt to taste.\n\nSet aside for a month to allow it to ferment. \n\nFermented Honey Liquor:\n\nCombine two hives' of strained honey with twice the amount of water, and a handful of hops. Cover and let ferment for a season before tasting. Ladle into bottles, seal them with beeswax, and put away.\n\nThe longer you let the bottles sit, the better the liquor will be.
I write this to record the fall of Camlorn and ask for our city to be avenged.\n\nI need to write this quickly, as I can hear the foul creatures howling outside my door. I don't know how long the barricade will hold and I want to finish this and hide it before they find me.\n\nSo, how did this all begin? As with most falls, we were betrayed. It was Jonathan Telwin, my one-time friend and companion, who had sworn himself to the service of Angof and the undead monster called Faolchu. Jonathan confided in me. He asked me to join his cause. I dismissed him, thinking this was just another of his many pranks. I was wrong.\n\nFaolchu made Jonathan a shifter, and the first wolf to breach our gates strolled in as though he belonged here. And we let him in, because he did. Once inside, Jonathan spread Faolchu's curse (he called it a gift) throughout the city. The cursed would meet at night, while the city slept, and we mistook the howls in the dark for wild dogs.\n\nAs the numbers of the cursed grew, they opened the gates and let Faolchu and the rest of his mad pack into the city. That was a few hours ago, just after night fell. They ripped apart anyone who tried to oppose them. The blood—there was so much blood! Those they didn't kill they … changed. I watched as my friends and neighbors transformed into wolves. Their screams were a mix of agony and ecstasy, and some dark part of me longed to join them. But I put such thoughts aside and got my family to safety.\n\nWe never would have made it if not for the Camlorn Guard. Captain Darien and a small number of guards attacked the werewolves and defended us as we made our escape. I must say, Captain Darien was magnificent. He seemed immune to each attack, dodging and blocking and laughing as though he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He cleared a path to a house and shouted for a group of civilians to get inside and barricade the doors and windows. We were one of those groups.\n\nI don't know what happened to the Captain and his guards, but I thank them for helping us. I can smell fires now. I think the wolves intend to burn us out.\n\nLet me end this letter by saying that Jonathan Telwin is a coward. He took the easy way out and convinced a certain number of people to join him. I can't forgive the massacre that he took part in. If you're reading this, please, avenge Camlorn. Put an end to Faolchu and his foul creatures. Don't let this injustice go unanswered.
The sound of clanking armor and approaching footsteps echoed through the dark streets. It was obvious that the marchers didn't care if they were heard. In fact, it sounded like they were trying to make more noise than was necessary.\n\nErric Deleyn closed his eyes and listened. He tried to count how many armor-clad boots were pounding toward them. Not that the numbers mattered. If there were two Alessians or ten, Erric knew how it would end. "Someone's going to stick a blade right through my head," he thought.\n\nErric felt a hand touch his shoulder and he opened his eyes. Calinden, the mercenary Ayleid knight with the long-flowing golden hair squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. "Stick close to me," Calinden said.\n\nA sense of calm came over Erric as he nodded in response. It was as if the Ayleid knight knew exactly what Erric was thinking. Erric would have taken more comfort in that thought if the sounds of the footsteps weren't getting closer and louder.\n\nKish'na, a Khajiiti warrior on Erric's other side, pulled two blades from their sheaths and held one up. She wanted them to hold for her signal. The other mercenaries in the alley shifted back and forth, excitement and fear shining in their eyes as they waited for the order to attack.\n\nMore steps. Louder. Louder. And then silence.\n\nErric looked around in surprise. Why had the unseen marchers stopped? The rest of the mercenary band seemed as confused as he was. Except for Kish'na and Calinden. Kish'na's raised blade did not move.\n\nErric would later learn that what happened next is what usually happens when you hire people willing to stab other people with swords and daggers. The mercenaries grow impatient and become eager to spill blood so they can collect their gold. Usually, this break in discipline brings such hired soldiers to their end that much quicker. And, unfortunately, it was Erric's group that broke first.\n\n"Kill those bastards!"\n\nThe yell rang out from someone behind and to the left of where Erric was standing. Suddenly they were rushing forward, more a tangled mass than a fighting formation. Erric was pushed to the side as weapon waving mercenaries shoved past him.\n\n"What are those idiots doing?" Kish'na demanded as the mercenaries left the cover of the alley. She shook her head in frustration but ran out after them, her twin blades drawn and ready.\n\nCalinden turned to Erric. "Remember what I said." And with that, the Elf pulled the large blade from the sheath on his back and ran to join the fray.\n\nErric felt panic overwhelm him and he stood frozen in place. The clang of weapons and shield. The roars of battle. The screams of pain. Everything sounded muffled to Erric's ears. His feet felt stuck to the cobbled street. The war had arrived, and Erric could only watch it unfold before him.\n\nAfter an eternity that really only lasted a few seconds, Erric was finally able to move. He lifted one foot and placed in front of the other. Slowly, deliberately, he repeated this action until he reached the edge of the alley wall. Erric took a steadying breath. Then he peered around the wall.
Just southwest of Dawnbreak, I've found the perfect place. An old Elven ruin open to the sea. We can run small boats right into the place, and smuggle the arcana off the island.\n\nDon't even talk about this near the Archmage. He'll take the coin right out of our fingers.
A map, a plan\nA way to get in.\nWill I find treasure?\nOr just a skull's grin?
Soldier Kazdi,\n\nYour request for transfer is denied. You'll act with deference and attend to Alchemist <<1>>'s orders or you'll face proscriptive judgment.\n\nI realize punitive expeditions aren't why you signed up, but a soldier's lot isn't to choose orders. Alchemist <<1>>'s arguably unconventional methods will lead to a quick and humane submission of the Pact, allowing us to focus our attention elsewhere. Never forget that Cyrodiil is our true prize.\n\nAnd Kazdi, between you and me, your mouth is bigger than the Elden Tree. If he discovers you're the source of the "Brute-vitar" nickname, you might just find out the full extent of his experiments firsthand.
Day 48:\n\nToday has to be the day. I've been deckhand for the Rusty Dagger for nearly two months and been tagging along behind the Black Oath for the better part of that. Captain Blackheart must've taken notice of me by now. I almost singlehandedly stormed the deck of that Stros M'kai merchant and slit the throat of the captain myself.\n\nDay 56:\n\nI saw him up close and by Oblivion he's scary. The stories of Captain Blackheart's hollow stare are not exaggerated. I thought I was ready, but I'm not sure anymore. His crew don't act like the rest of us. They return to the Haven after every voyage and we never see them until the next trip. They must have something special in there. \n\nI am still going to try to get in there and join Blackheart's crew officially.\n\nDay 71:\n\nI know I impressed him now. Iron Heel came to me last night and told me that the Captain's going to want to see me tomorrow. This is it, my big chance.
Fewer and fewer travelers are using the roads thanks to all the recent trouble. There's no one to send up your way.\n\nPlease, give me some time. I have a plan to start trying to send them from the cities. I need a few days to actually get around people though.\n\nJust keep that slimy pet of yours far away from me. I'll make sure it has something to eat soon.
I despair of ever finding a solution to the catalyst problem. Even Zur's usual unfounded optimism cannot seem to lift my spirits. I have gone over all possible candidates for a catalyst to ignite the process to forge the antipodal rods. The only substance that we might have access to is the corrupted blood of a feral creature.\n\nWe examined a dead creature and Zur tried to transform its blood, but his alchemical process was flawed. Our Daedric captors, however, apparently had more success in this area. Samples of corrupted blood are stored in the experiment chamber, where they are guarded by a monster the Daedra created using that very same blood.\n\nNow you comprehend my despair. If I had enough strength to access my full power, I could easily subdue this monster and we could take as many vials of corrupted blood as we could carry. As it is, we barely have the energy to cast simple illusions, and even these fail more often than not. There is no way we could survive an encounter with the chamber's guardian.\n\nZur firmly holds to the hope that someone will find us. But I suspect that our Mages Guild companions are busy dealing with their own problems.\n\nI fear this mission has already ended in failure and that we are doomed to succumb to this soul-meld. But I shall not dash Zur's hope. As disorganized as he can be, I find some small comfort in his blind faith.
By Fastor\n\nEveryone knows what happened to Gil-Var-Delle. And at the same time, no one does.\nLegend has it that Molag Bal, the dreaded Daedric Prince, set foot into that Wood Elf township—consumed it, according to the myth—whatever that actually means. Ancient tales employ metaphors like armies employ soldiers.\n\nIf Bal himself visited this plane with evil intent, why do any of us remain? The stories about him would lead one to believe he would not have stopped with the razing of a single Wood Elf town—he wouldn't have stopped until all of Tamriel was in flames. Just one common question of many regarding the Daedric Prince's so-called visit.\n\nSome retort that perhaps someone stopped him—possibly an opposing Daedric Prince, a Divine, or an agent of the Aedra. But again, where is the evidence for this? No mage or historian—that I've spoken to, at least—has been able to reference a specific text for this information.\n\nMany a historical fiction piece has attempted to dramatize what occurred there, but none of those stories can be confirmed, except to say that a catastrophic event struck the town. Perhaps the residents were killed, perhaps they fled. None were ever heard from again, but for all anyone knows, a large fire could have been the culprit. I can't imagine anything more catastrophic than that to a Wood Elf dwelling.\n\nToday, Gil-Var-Delle is a maligned place, and there are not many who dare to venture near. But not because of any tangible foes—save cowardice and superstition.
This is a story the Wood Elves of Valenwood tell their children from a very young age.\n\nOnce, there was nothing but formlessness. The land held no shape, the trees did not harden into timber and bark, and the Elves themselves shifted from form to form. This formlessness was called the Ooze.\n\nBut Y'ffre took the Ooze and ordered it. First, she told of the Green, the forest and all the plant life in it. She gave the Green the power to shape itself as it willed, for it was her first tale. \n\nThe Elves were Y'ffre's second tale. As Y'ffre spun the story, the Elves took the form they have today. Y'ffre gave them the power to tell stories, but warned them against trying to shape themselves or the Green. Shifting and the destruction of the forest were forbidden. \n\nInstead, Y'ffre commended the Wood Elves to the Green, so that they might ask the Green to provide them with shelter and a safe passage, and as long as they respected the Green, it would obey. This is called the Green Pact.\n\nFinally, Y'ffre told of all the beasts that crawl on the land or swim in the rivers or fly in the air. These, Y'ffre gave to the Wood Elves as sustenance. They were to eat no plants but consume only meat. Y'ffre also told that no Wood Elf who is struck down by another Wood Elf should be allowed to sink into the ground, but should instead be consumed, like the beasts. This is called the Meat Mandate.\n\nWhen the stories were told, Y'ffre saw that they had a pleasing shape, but some of the Ooze remained. Y'ffre told a final tale then, and gave purpose to the Ooze. \n\nAny Wood Elf that violated the Green Pact, either by shifting or by damaging the Green, would be condemned to return to the formlessness of the Ooze. Their names would be scrubbed from the story Y'ffre is telling and replaced with silence. \n\nThe Wood Elves tell that those who are favored by the Green have the power to release the condemned from the Ooze, but where the condemned go and what form they take once they are released is unknown. \n\nNo one has ever seen the Ooze, or heard the souls trapped in it, or met the one who can relieve the condemned of their punishment. But if you ask a Wood Elf if he thinks the Ooze is "just a tale," he will invariably reply, "There is no such thing as 'just a tale.'"
Every Wood Elf knows that the more inward the part, the better it tastes. While other races cook their meat until it is dry and bloodless, and waste entrails and brains, the Wood Elf knows that these parts are the juiciest and therefore the most flavorful.\n\nThe following delicacy is a highlight from the Greenshade region of Valenwood:\n\nJugged Venison\n\n1 Venison Haunch, bloody\nStock\n1 Imported Onion, finely chopped\n\nHang the Haunch for 5 days, until it is tender to the touch.\n\nHeat the haunch in over a medium flame. The oil will give the meat a nice crisp outside. When the meat starts to pop, remove it from the heat.\n\nSeal the hot meat in a vase or jug with the stock and the onion. Let it stand for another fortnight. \n\nTo serve, open the jug and pour the tender haunch onto the table. It is so tender no knife is required. \n\nThis meal will feed a family of four, or a hunter who has gone a few days without killing any prey.\n\nThere are many more such delicacies, often passed down from parent to child.
By Zwinthodurr Roun-dar \n\nSpies walk among us. Across Elsweyr, in every street, in every village, around every campfire—we are watched. \n\n"But of course!" you say. "Our tribal elders and clan mothers watch over us always, in the name of Alkosh, Mara, and Azurah!"\n\nAnd that is true. So they do. \n\nBut there are Others. \n\nOthers who watch our every move, who suspect us of "disloyalty," who can report us as unfaithful and treasonous. \n\nReport us? To who? To the officers of the Mane? \n\nOh, no. Not to Cat-Folk at all. \n\nThese watchers report only to the Elves. \n\nAdmit it: you have heard their name. But only in whispers. And you dare not repeat it. \n\nThey are … the Eyes of the Queen. \n\nThe Eyes, who are beholden to no one but the tall and terrible Queen Ayrenn.\n\nHer Eyes see everything, they say. But how, since Elves cannot go everywhere? Because, Khajiit, Elven gold can—and does.\n\nHush. You know it to be true. \n\nAnd because you are watched, your tail-dance droops ever-so-slightly, your ears stand a little less proud, and you look over your shoulder a little too often. \n\nBecause who can say who has been bought, and who has not? Who might be sending reports about you—and what might they be saying? \n\nWhere did that neighbor of yours go last Middas? Was it to receive new orders from the Eyes? Or was she taken away, perhaps to Alinor itself, and the dungeons beneath the Crystal Tower? \n\nBeware, Khajiit. Keep your whiskers alert.\n\nThis one is watched. And this one may not be permitted to warn you again.
This new group has proven to be extremely loyal. I cannot say how pleased this makes me. Finding loyal recruits who won't turn on you or run away at the first sign of danger is hard to do these days. \n\nWe've found the perfect location for a base of operations: the ruins of Fort Sphinxmoth. One of my men grew up in the region and told us that he and a friend used to explore some caves in the area. After four days of searching we uncovered a large network of underground chambers. This shall make a fine new home. \n\nI've decided to change the name of our little band of outlaws. Muckwater Bandits no longer suits us seeing as we don't operate out of the Muckwater anymore. And I never really liked Muckwater anyway … sounds more like a tribe of Goblins than a gang of outlaws. From now on we shall call ourselves the Sphinxmoth Bandits. That has a much better ring to it!\n\nI've set the men to work refurbishing the old traps to protect our underground dwelling. We've found this place has many old traps, both mundane and magical. Octavia, who knows the most about magic, has been poking at some of the more unusual ones and trying to figure out how to make them function again. \n\nI've discovered an ancient vault deep within the ruins. Unfortunately, someone appears to have cleaned it out long ago, but it will make the perfect location for me to store my personal treasures.\n\nThe deal I've made with the Stonefire Cult to rob the Temple of Mara will give us incredible wealth. I don't know what they want with the Chalice of Mara and I don't really care. All I know is that it will make me wealthy beyond my wildest dreams.
Ra Gada fought the tusky folk\nFrom Hammerfell they drove them\nIn wrath withdrew they northward to\nOrsinium, Orc city\nWhere found they welcome at the hands\nOf King Atop the Scarpment, \nGolkarr, mighty, Orc of wiles\nWho thought to take advantage\nTo use infusion of new blood\nTo broaden Orcish holdings\n\nDemands he made of Bretons south\nAlong the Bjoulsae River\nFor tariffs, tolls, ransoms, fees,\nOr down would come Orc hammer\nBut Joile, the king in Daggerfall\nRejected Golkarr's dictum\nSent to Gaiden Shinji of \nThe Order of Diagna\nUrged him with the Bretons join\nTo siege and sack Orc city\n\nMarched they then to Wrothgar Scarp\nOrsinium invested\nThey thought that Orcish walls could not\nWithstand their worthy weapons\nBut city high upon the scarp\nWas triple-gate defended\nObdurate Gates: each one greater \nThan the one before it\nSmelter, Hammer, Temper, they\nWere called, by Orcish stonewrights\nThe folk of Mauloch stood atop\nAnd hurled down baneful missiles\nAnd Breton, Redguard, smitten sore\nDrew back to lower regions\n\nLaughed then the Orcs, and bared their tusks\nAt warrior Men confounded\nWhile Golkarr smiled in high Scarp Keep \nAnd praised the Wrothgar clan-kin\nBut Gaiden Shinji and King Joile\nWere not abashed or shaken\nThey summoned grandees, knights, and counts\nTo bring their armsmen thither\nOrsinium surrounded they\nAnd settled in to siege it\n\nWhile plots and plans were schemed and made\nThe walls and gates, to breach them\nThe Orcs were quite content to wait\nFrom Jugular well-watered\nAnd fed by fertile fungus fields\nIn Caves of Dark Abundance\nThe Men, they thought, would tire and leave\nTo go back to their families\nThey reckoned not the fire that burned \nIn Joile and Gaiden Shinji\n\nTen years their men sieged outer gate\nAnd finally Smelter faltered\nA decade more at second gate\nTill Hammer then was broken\nTen years again were spent in toil\nTill Temper fell asunder\nThen wrathful Men at last went in \nOrsinium to plunder\nGolkarr prayed in Grudgement Hall\nFor Mauloch to defend him\nBut King Joile took him by the hair\nAnd Gaiden Shinji slew him
How dare they? Hypocrites! Pretenders! What gives the Mages Guild the right to call my particular practice of magic the Black Arts? And to forbid our use of these precious and ancient arts on pain of death? Ludicrous! Don't they understand? We control death! It is ours to command and we do not fear its cold embrace! No. We welcome it.\n\nOnly the foolish and the fearful refuse to grasp power due to its source. They call us evil, but we are merely prudent. They call us irresponsible, but we understand the concept of risk and reward. They claim we bring terror and misery to the world … well, at least on this matter we are in agreement. The world should fear us! For we have embraced the power of the dead and made it our own. Let the fools in the Mages Guild play at their conjurations and alterations. We are necromancers, and our magicka cannot be stifled or restrained.\n\nI have heard it said that a great debate rages in the halls of arcane academia. These so-called scholars argue the relative merits and risks of necromancy, but they do so from ignorance and fear. There is no need to debate the issue. Necromancy is the one, true path to power. It is our path. And we will not be denied!
Entry 1\n<<1>> honors us with our inclusion in the Dominion's Gold Fleet! We are to join the Rusty Claw, Mara's Teat, and the Prowler in <<Ac:2>> to embark a contingent of Wood Elf marines.\n\nEntry 2\nMade port in Haven under cover of night. Associates offloaded our cargo before <<3>> and his soldiers. We disembarked leaving a hold full of rats and Mer. The Wood Elves don't seem to mind. I watched one dig into the vermin with relish.\n\nI must pray to Khenarthi for strong winds. There are only so many rats.\n\nEntry 3\nReligious beliefs are one thing, but if any more Bosmer complain about our ship being made of wood, I'll invite them to swim to <<4>>.\n\nEntry 4\nMet up with this "Gold Fleet." It's a fleet to be sure, but the only gold here was spent constructing it. So many ships! It's a wonder they don't become tangled like ja'Khajiit at play.\n\nEntry 5\nThe Wood Elves are amicable enough, but the High Elves are less than pleased with our presence. One wonders why they asked us here at all.\n\nThe fleet sighted an unknown vessel on the horizon. We offered to pursue, but the High Elves insisted one of theirs should go after it. Nothing found, of course. Our ships may not be polished to a brilliant sheen, but they are fast. Had they listened, we'd have known who shadowed the fleet.\n\nEntry 6\nStorm. Thunder. Death. Abandoning ship with all hands. S'rendarr watch over us.
The infamous Khajiiti warrior Moon-Scythe and a small entourage made their way toward Willowgrove under cover of night. In a stunning display of night-time manuevering, they were ambushed by Bosmeri defenders and slaughtered. \n\nRelics Sought:\n— Moon-Scythe's remains\n— Moon-Scythe's silver claw
Something's building—something big. The air in <<1>> positively crackles. It's nothing like the ancient energies at <<Ac:2>>. This is fresh, nearly bursting at the edges!\n\nThe carvings on these bodies clearly has something to do with it. Ritual magic, perhaps? I must investigate further.
Akatosh, my strength comes from your hands, \nMy enemies fall before my sword.\nCan you hear their cries?\nDeath, they cry.\nDeath, I sing.\nBut death is theirs, not mine.\n\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!\n\nStendarr, grant my weapon fall only thus:\nFor justice, for the right ways.\nCan you hear my plea?\nJustice, they pray.\nJustice, I sing.\nJustice is mine, and also theirs.\n\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!\n\nFor the way of the righteous is mercy,\nAnd compassion for the weak.\nCan I wield your sword and shield?\nMercy, they beg.\nMercy, I give.\nSwift death to the unjust!\nSlow death to the merciless!\n\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!
Mother,\n\nI am writing to you from Reaper's March, in the northern part of the forest called Valenwood. The ink used is native to the area, and contains several notable properties not found in Summerset inks. Perhaps you can work out the mathematical equations I've worked into the margins? Consider these elements my evidence that distance from home does not diminish one's mental capacity or acuity. \n\nOur beliefs have rarely coincided, as you know, and so it should come as no surprise to either of us that our life paths diverge so dramatically. Know that I bear you no ill will for your words prior to my departure. \n\nTake my silent response as a sign of my love for you, that I would not speak intemperately. My knowledge of the world has increased a thousandfold with Pircalmo at my side, and I have come to believe that perhaps it is the place of some Altmer to live outside of Summerset. Spreading the gifts we have discovered for ourselves to others.\n\nPircalmo and I plan to return to Summerset, and I hope that you find it in your schedule to ….
This is the story of a boy. This is the story of the land. This is the story of how the boy and the land came to be. \n\nThe boy's name was Ostion. He had the power to shape the land. He whispered his instructions and the land willingly obeyed. But the boy was alone.

By Honnorah af-Lahreq\n\nThe Gallants of Hammerfell are known far and wide as Tamriel's finest sword-wielders, but they are known equally well for their skill as riders of horses. A Redguard Gallant is nearly always depicted with a sword in one hand, and the reins of a loyal steed in the other.\n\nAnd no breed of horse is more closely associated with the Knights of the Desert than the Yokudan Charger. Indeed, the Yokudan Charger is the mightiest of breeds, the pride of all who trade in horseflesh in Hammerfell. Faced with the heat and harsh terrain of the Alik'r, lesser horses falter and die, while the Yokudan Charger survives, even thrives. The Charger reacts to a challenge like his rider the Gallant: head up, nostrils flaring, ever prepared to show his or her mettle.\n\nHere at Aswala Stables we breed and sell only Yokudan Chargers of certified descent, steeds of proven lineage that count among their forebears the horses Yaghoub the Seafarer brought in his fleet from Akos Kasaz. We are a little bit off the beaten track, but we count ourselves lucky to be situated in the awe-inspiring heart of our magnificent Alik'r Desert, and when you see the steeds we have on offer we think you'll agree it's worth the trek. \n\nThe Yokudan Charger: a grand tradition, and for us, a sacred trust. Come, accept the hospitality of Aswala Stables, and judge for yourself.
Aldmeri Dominion Expeditionary Forces, General Order Seven\n\nAll those who march under the Eagle Banner represent the glorious heritage of the Aldmeri Race—yes, even those of the Valued Ally Races—and in occupied areas all troops, regardless of pedigree, are required to abide by the Military Protocols of Propriety. \n\nAt the most fundamental level these protocols number only five. They are presented here in terms comprehensible even by those of lesser intellectual attainment.\n\nONE:  Foraging is Mandatory, but Looting is Forbidden\n\nWhile it is true that regions brought under the protection of the Aldmeri Dominion are required to pay indemnity-in-kind to support Dominion forces, this indemnity is to be collected with a strict adherence to the Rule of Fifths: one-fifth of all tangible goods and currency in a Dominion-protected region belong to the Dominion. Personal looting is forbidden. \n\nTWO: Pay for What You Take\n\nPersonal goods acquired by troops in an occupied region are to be paid for at the appropriate market rate. For this purpose all troops are supplied with a liberal quantity of Dominion Scrip, paper currency which the locals in an occupied region will be able to redeem after hostilities cease. \n\nNOTE: Troops are not to accept Dominion Scrip as payment for goods or services. \n\nTHREE: Do Not Fraternize with the Locals\n\nThe locals in occupied regions often display vulgar behavior, subscribe to improper belief systems, and foment inappropriate ideas. Sometimes they even suffer a false sense of grievance against the Dominion which may manifest itself in dangerous misbehavior. Be a "Safe Soldier," and fraternize only with those certified entertainers who have been admitted into the Recreation Compound. \n\nFOUR: Maintain Uniform Standards of Appearance\n\nDo not fall prey to the temptation to adopt local attire, no matter how comfortable or festive. Maintain that superior reserve that reflects true Aldmeri Propriety.\n\nFIVE: Tolerate No Disrespect\n\nThe forces of the Dominion Military are the physical incarnation of the Glory of the Aldmeri Peoples, and as such must be respected by members of the tertiary races. Failure to show proper deference to Dominion personnel or the Eagle Banner is to be immediately punished at the appropriate level of severity (as delineated in Article 317, Deference and Decorum). \n\nIf you have questions about any of the above, consult your superior officer, or apply to your unit ceremoniarch for the course in Advanced Aldmeri Propriety.\n\nIn the Queen's Name, \n\nLegate Calevarnel
By Phrastus of Elinhir\n\nWe come now to consideration of the spriggan, the elusive, feminine nature spirit of the deep woods. Of course, we all know the name from the taunting children's joke that goes:\n\n"Guess what?"\n\n"What?"\n\n"Spriggan butt!"\n\n…But beyond this juvenile jest, what can scholarship tell us about these half-flora/half-fauna creatures? Unfortunately, though I have consulted all the standard sources, the academics of Tamriel have little to say about the spriggans' whys and wherefores. \n\nFrom both legend and from authenticated stories of personal encounters, we know that spriggans are somehow mystically tied to certain copses or thickets, verdant groves which they fiercely defend against trespassers. Spriggan sap is said to be venomous, and they are known to be able to magically heal themselves when wounded, making them dangerous opponents.\n\nIn addition, spriggans have some sort innate connection to the animals and plants that inhabit their sacred groves, and there are many verified accounts of animals fighting at their sides against intruders. These allies include not just animals that are naturally aggressive, such as bears or swarms of hornets, but even usually timid creatures like deer and elk. \n\nWhether these animal allies defend spriggans out of love or friendship, or whether they are magically summoned by an innate spell ability on the part of the spriggan, is an open question, and a matter of some debate among those who study mystizoology. There is no doubt, however, that spriggans are creatures of a magical nature, as is clearly evidenced by the powerful qualities of the so-called "taproots" that are harvested from their bodies when slain. These taproots are prized by alchemists for their undeniable arcane properties, which enable the concoction of complex potions from powerful reagents that are otherwise immiscible. \n\nAs to their origins, that is a mystery that so far none have solved. We find accounts of "Spryggain Groaves" dating all the way back to the beginning of the First Era, as well as mention of "tree-daughters" in the ancient myths of Y'ffre and the Earth Bones. Their common name seems to derive from "sprig," the Nedic term for a fresh green twig or offshoot, but beyond that everything about their origins is obscure.\n\nFrom a purely physical standpoint spriggans certainly come in several forms, with reports of a variety of barks and foliage. This may represent different strains or sub-species, or it may simply be a reflection of the spriggan's mystical connection with its local flora. Spriggans seem to resemble the plants of the groves wherein they live, even reflecting the seasonal nature of those who reside in the deciduous forests of northern Tamriel. In the opinion of this scholar, the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter spriggans are all the same creatures merely undergoing seasonal metamorphosis.\n\nSome have gone so far as to assert that spriggans have a hierarchy, with lesser members of the species owing allegiance to the greater, who are sometimes termed "spriggan matron" or even "spriggan earth mother." Here is where we must draw the line between scholarship and storytelling: though a spriggan's form outwardly resembles that of a human female, there is no evidence whatsoever that they can engage in intelligent behavior, or that they can organize into hierarchical groups. The creatures of the natural world, even those that are quasi-magical, behave entirely according to instinct, and to endow them with human emotion or thought is mere sentimentalism. If you're partial to that sort of fanciful twaddle, I refer you to the works of Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, who produces it in great reams.
My creation lives! It moves, it rends and tears. It is young yet and it craves blood, but I do believe this opens up a most interesting branch of necromancy. Assuming it is necromancy. Yes, let's say that it is.\n\nThere was a time when the shrieks and screams of the people might have bothered me. But their sacrifice and their pain, their rich, warm blood—how can giving my creation life bother me in any way? They are not dead. Not truly. Not while my creature lives. In a sense, they continue to live as well. The time for concern and mercy is long behind me.\n\nFew understand, but few have my power. They have not glimpsed the pulsing heart of the Doomcrag. They have not risked all and taken that power within themselves. I pity them. Not for their pain and fear and torn flesh. I pity them their simple lives, their lack of power, their closed minds. \n\nI shall leave this creation with my vampires. They can tend it, nurture it, feed it the flesh of the feral ones. Or the flesh of any survivors—if there are any survivors. When the creature is stronger and larger, they can unleash it on Rivenspire. In the meantime, I will create more such creatures, I will create an army of living flesh!\n\nLet the revolting peasants give themselves to the glory of my creation! All will know my name. Even Montclair and Lleraya will see what I can create, what I can do. Let them wonder what else my power will accomplish. I care less about their petty concerns with every passing day.\n\n— Reezal-Jul
Grand Warlord,\n\nI agree with your decision to retain control of the Elder Scrolls. The scrolls are needed for the war effort, as you say. Handing them to the Moth Priest would only result in them falling into the hands of the Dominion or Pact.\n\nI have had temple guards escort Belenius away from the grounds. He will return, but we'll keep kicking him out.\n\n— Protector Yseline
Many will tell of the loveliness of Elves\nAnd still more will sing of the fine human form\nbut where is song or sign that augurs\nall that is beautiful about Ogres?\n\nUgh. Maybe mother is right. Poetry is silly. It's for High Elves in their mansions who have nothing better to do, who couldn't hunt their dinner if you put a roast chicken on the floor and told them to stab it with a spear.\n\nBeautiful ogres? What was I thinking? I suppose they do move in a kind of slow, majestic, stately way. But they smell awful, and they're a nuisance. \n\nIt's like mother says, "If you want to impress me, try killing an ogre, not immortalizing it in verse."\n\nWell, she can have it her way, then. I'm off to kill an ogre. \n\nAnd then when I'm done, maybe I'll write a poem about it:\n\nBravely the Elf stood strong\nAgainst the club and thong\nLanding strikes on stinking flesh\nDuelling the giant to giant death.\n\nNo, still not right.
At the insistence of the ever-worried Keera, I am writing a will. She feels we head into grave danger, from which we may never return. I think the rumors of hauntings and undead hordes are overblown. We've faced undead before; even Philien no longer wets himself at the sight of skeletons. Those we dispatched outside the cave are probably the worst we'll face.\n\nBut, to make Keera happy ….\n\nTo my brother Wilvor, currently living in Bruma, I leave all my possessions, except our father's sword, which he is unworthy to wield. I want that buried with my ashes. There, done.\n\nSigned,\n\nOtrovor Knifeborn
Grigerda cursed me for a fool, begged me not to go. But we'll never defeat the Shadowed Path on our own. And none of the alliances will help us; they're too busy killing each other to care about one small town.\n\nIt must be done, and I'm the one to do it. The others with me, our strongest warriors, should get me past the creatures of the upper caverns. Once we reach the hidden catacombs, the true struggle begins. The dead that patrol there will not let us pass easily. We must force our way through. Somewhere, deep within the crypts, lies the power that animates these long-dead soldiers.\n\nI know how to appeal to that power, what sacrifice it will require. But for Jafola, who has my heart, and for all of Bruma, I must do it. The dead of Toadstool Hollow will rise again in defense of their land.
Rangers,\n\nI trust you refrained from opening these orders until after passing Fort Ash. Your mission is to travel to far southeastern Cyrodiil, deep into enemy territory. There, somewhere south of Drakelowe Keep, is a natural cavern know to the locals as Newt Cave. \n\nA previous scout team sent back a report before entering the cave, telling of rumors that great treasure waited within. This team has not been heard from again. You are to discover what happened to them and recover any treasure inside the cave.\n\nRemember, you volunteered for this.\n\n— Captain Izard
He calls my name at night, when the others are quiet.\n\nI serve him. I bring him sacrifices. Only then does he cease calling, for a time. But never for long.\n\nThey are easy to convince, greed drives them. "Come with me, to Vahtacen," I whisper. "Treasure lies there, for the bold to take. A king's treasure, riches of the ancient Ayleids." By twos, threes, more, they follow me down to the lake and into the catacombs. To Vahtacen, to Vahtacen. But only I return.\n\nHe spares me, bids his minions let me pass, because of the lives I bring to him. So long as I lead hot blood to his altar, I live. But there must always be more.\n\nCome with me, to Vahtacen.
By Anonymous\n\nThere are many supposed paths to immortality, though few have been tested, and those that have been tried have just as often proved to be mere flights of fancy, fashionable cure-alls with no real effect besides the status they grant those able to acquire them.\n\nIt is rumored that several pools and springs throughout Tamriel can grant immortality. These places are often hidden in the most inaccessible and hard to reach places. Such places are rumored to exist deep in the swamps of Shadowfen, on the highest peaks of Rivenspire, and in an ancient glade of Malabal Tor. Explorers have sought out these places for centuries, and while many have returned with stories of their success, not one has yet thought to mark the locations on a map.\n\nAmong nobles of the First Era, drinking the honey of the Isgareth Bee of Auridon was said to grant limited immortality, though one needed to continue to eat the honey in order to maintain the effect. Some say this led directly to Isgareth Bee's extinction, as indiscriminate men destroyed whole hives in order to more quickly harvest the precious golden substance and sell it at a high price to the foolish and fashionable. Though it is also said that Altmeri kings and queens maintain a private hive.\n\nAnother means of achieving immortality is said to exist, but it has only been attempted by the most volatile and unstable. It's also forbidden, both by governments across Tamriel and by the Mages Guild. It's said to involve the binding of a Daedra through blood sacrifice. \n\nFor so long as the Daedra can be held captive, life may be prolonged. It is unknown whether any who have attempted this method have been able to see it through to its end. It's more likely that the Daedra breaks loose and kills the attempter, or that the attempter destroys himself through his own madness.
Left <<1>> in <<2>>. Stupid Wood Elf finally did one thing right, stealing this bow. Wish I could see the look on his face when he realizes I took it. Thinks I'm not smart. Thinks I can't outwit a tree-brain like him.\n\nLocals say there's a treasure buried in this cave. But they avoid it because of the stranglers. Imagine that. Afraid of plants. Elves are so pathetic.\n\n*****\nCan't sleep. Keep hearing something coming from the cave. Singing? Or wailing? Hard to tell, Never had much of an ear for music. \n\nSick of it. Don't need to wait for morning. I'm going in.
Written with the inherent Breton taste for duplicity and over-florid conceit toward exceptionalism, the letters regarding the plight of Wayrest at the hands of marauding Orcs reached out to bind the races of Men against the lesser Mer. \n\nThe perpetual nature and inclination toward war for the followers of the dung of Trinimac serves as bonding agent toward Hammerfell and High Rock only so long as it is able to bring the foolishly honorable remnants of the Ra Gada to place their back toward the Bretons, at which point King Joile bares his deceitful dagger.\n\nIt is claimed by certain historians and political commentators of the time, notably Morgaulle Dechery of Evermore, that by virtue of an outside order of so-called "Sword Saints," the conflict did not culminate in the downfall of both Orsinium and Hammerfell at the hands of King Joile. \n\nHowever, I posit that King Joile lacked the strength to carry through with his initiative, even if he had been able to capture the whole of the Bangkorai Pass, for the man lacked the strength to even safeguard his own person from one well-armed woman, Makela Leki.\n\nIt becomes apparent that King Joile waited until the time was right to attack the scions of Hammerfell, not because he was clever, but because he could not have possibly initiated his plans before then. In the typical short-sightedness of man ….
It is true that the king had not the strong feelings of the rest of the people of High Rock well in mind; but he was affected by a sudden clarity following his meeting with the envoy. King Joile had lived in so respectable a manner as to elicit the ire of the Redguards, even though he had done every conceivable thing within his power to grant them comfort and courtesy within his presence.\n\nThe Ra Gada were no more than a comparatively new and invasive people, who began their residence upon the shores of Tamriel only after rendering their homeland irreparably damaged. These Ra Gada interlopers were received into Hammerfell and began to make short work of their local Orsimer neighbors, presuming so far as to call themselves the Forebears, while in fact the lands had occupancy precursors in the Orsimer, Dwemer, Ayleids, and even the Goblins!\n\nIt should be known by now that the Redguards are thusly not the legal inheritors of Hammerfell, nor are they owed any claim upon the territories of Bangkorai. In the society of civilized Evermore, the untoward rage which issued forth from Orsinium was therefore not the only immediate threat, but also too was the concealed blade of the Redguards. \n\nFor what people carry upon them at all times blades but those who intend to bear some immediacy in using them against others?\n\nKing Joile's reaction toward the Redguard forces within Bangkorai during the conflict proceeded not merely from malice, but from goodness of heart and a desire to bring solid safety and comfort to his peoples across all of High Rock.\n\nThe Maidens of the Spirit Sword, who were maidens only in name, were rendered wroth by naught but this protective instinct! It would have quieted their mannish ambitions if they could have seen his noble bearing, the acknowledged eminence of his countenance when not upon the field of battle.

A partnership between Wood Elf, High Elf, and the Khajiit is preposterous. Can you not see? Queen Ayrenn will take and take, like a well-coifed hoarvor suckling at a heart-wound. The High Elves would like nothing more than to have us under their rule. We're less than cousins, less than Elves, to them.\n\nIt's time for the Bosmer to hunt again. We'll take Valenwood back. For our people, for Hircine. And we'll have Hircine's blessing as we do it.\n\n—Calahawn

Lieutenant Pera,\n\nYou have seen the official orders; these must be read to your troops. For your eyes only, I add this warning.\n\nThe recall to the Imperial City will not be welcomed by the soldiers. The rumors of what we face there have spread faster than the wind. Fear grips all who have any sense. The brave overcome this fear and march.\n\nYou may face a mutiny. Give them no time to organize. Strike camp immediately. If you sense resistance, kill the ringleaders. Hesitation could mean your death and the loss of your troops for the Empire.\n\nI march to the northwestern bridge. Meet me there. To delay means death.\n\n— Captain Virgilus
By Ralevyn Nerano\n\nFlexibility or maximum protection? Netch or guar? Maybe you've heard one of the heated arguments, fueled by a few too many cups of mazte at your local cornerclub. Almost every craftsman takes an almost religious stance on this matter, believing his own approach, traditions, and products to be superior to all others, but I want to present both sides and some of their considerations in an unbiased manner to help inform your own opinion.\n\nThe best leather in Tamriel comes from Morrowind, courtesy of the native guar and netches. This is an indisputable fact, and no other leathers produced in Tamriel come close to their quality. The naturally-exposed hides of these beasts and the ease of processing them, combined with ancient tanning techniques, produce a material that is more durable and tougher than bear, mammoth, or any of the hides commonly used outside Morrowind. Though both are of very high quality, the debate rages on—which makes superior armor? \n\nNetch leather is thinner by quite a bit. It bends and flexes easily, and it is much more receptive to dyes than guar hide, and therefore more suitable for finer, more ornamental works. It is likewise ideal for the combatant who prefers mobility, but it is much more readily punctured and torn, even when boiled to increase toughness. Another difficulty is that it requires relatively high maintenance—to keep it in fighting shape, it must be oiled and treated with dreugh wax weekly. Netch leather is harder to harvest, as well; the beasts are quite dangerous when riled and have a nasty poison that even experienced netchimen fear. \n\nGuar hide, on the other hand, is much thicker, resulting in heavier armors overall (though still not as heavy, obviously, as armors crafted from metal). This makes it more difficult to work with, but the end product offers more protection and durability. Staunch traditionalists frequently claim that guar hide has been used longer than netch leather, and that we honor our ancestors in favoring it, but I have been able to locate no proof of this point. If you're more interested in protection than in mobility, guar hide armor is likely a better choice for you.\n\nEven though every craftsman seems to have an unwavering opinion on which leather results in superior armors, I am not swayed by either side. It occurs to me that the choice is largely on the wearer, depending on his or her own fighting style (though armorers are never shy to offer recommendations in this regard, either). Hopefully, you are more informed now about your options, and whether you choose netch, guar, or an unorthodox combination of both, I wish you luck on the battlefield.
2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n29 First Seed, 2920\nHegathe, Hammerfell\n\nYou have a letter from the Imperial City," said the chief priestess, handing the parchment to Corda. All the young priestesses smiled and made faces of astonishment, but the truth was that Corda's sister Rijja wrote very often, at least once a month.\n\nCorda took the letter to the garden to read it, her favorite place, an oasis in the monochromatic sand-colored world of the conservatorium The letter itself was nothing unusual: filled with court gossip, the latest fashions which were tending to winedark velvets, and reports of the Emperor's ever-growing paranoia.\n\n"You are so lucky to be away from all of this," wrote Rijja. "The Emperor is convinced that his latest battlefield fiasco is all a result of spies in the palace. He has even taken to questioning me. Ruptga keep it so you never have a life as interesting as mine."\n\nCorda listened to the sounds of the desert and prayed to Ruptga the exact opposite wish.\n\n3 Rain's Hand, 2920\nColdharbour, Oblivion\n\nSotha Sil proceeded as quickly as he could through the blackened halls of the palace, half-submerged in brackish water. All around him, nasty gelatinous creatures scurried into the reeds, bursts of white fire lit up the upper arches of the hall before disappearing, and smells assaulted him, rancid death one moment, sweet flowered perfume the next. Several times he had visited the Daedra princes in their Oblivion, but every time, something different awaited him.\n\nHe knew his purpose, and refused to be distracted.\n\nEight of the more prominent Daedra princes were awaiting him in the half-melted, domed room. Azura, Prince of Dusk and Dawn; Boethiah, Prince of Plots; Herma-Mora, Daedra of Knowledge; Hircine, the Hunter; Malacath, God of Curses; Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Disaster; Molag Bal, Prince of Rage; Sheogorath, the Mad One.\n\nAbove them, the sky cast tormented shadows upon the meeting.\n\n5 Rain's Hand, 2920\nThe Isle of Artaeum, Summurset\n\nSotha Sil's voice cried out, echoing from the cave, "Move the rock!"\n\nImmediately, the initiates obeyed, rolling aside the great boulder that blocked the entrance to the Dreaming Cavern. Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary. He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired. Lilatha took his arm to help him walk, but he refused her help with a kind smile and a shake of his head.\n\n"Were you … successful?" she asked.\n\n"The Daedra princes I spoke with have agreed to our terms," he said flatly. "Disasters such as befell Gilverdale should be averted. Only through certain intermediaries such as witches or sorcerers will they answer the call of man and mer."\n\n"And what did you promise them in return?" asked the Nord boy Welleg.\n\n"The deals we make with Daedra," said Sotha Sil, continuing on to Iachesis' palace to meet with the Master of the Psijic Order, "should not be discussed with the innocent."
Today one of our number, Ibrula, went into the wilderness and did not return. Ordinarily, we would not be concerned—the Star-Gazers have lived in Craglorn a long time. We are not unfamiliar with the region's dangers.\n\nBut Ibrula has always been unusual—lately more so. Some of the others heard her muttering something under her breath. Her latest delusion seems to be that the world is about to be attacked by some hitherto unknown force.\n\nWe told her that the atronachs summoned by the mages of Elinhir have the worm cult well in hand and the Prince of Schemes has no hold in Craglorn, but she was not consoled by this.\n\nIn spite of her eccentricities, or perhaps because of them, we are all very worried about Ibrula. We have decided to wait until morning and then send a party to try to find her.\n\n—\n\nWe have come across a small house, surrounded by all manner of magical wards. Torn pieces of a book indicate that Ibrula was here at some point, and her scrawl marks a sign at the entrance to the place, warning us away. Did she fall victim to these traps? Or did she create them? And if so, to what end? To keep us out? Or to keep something else in?\n\nEither way, it's apparent that Ibrula's delusion has grown worse than we'd imagined.\n\n—\n\nAfter a few days (I've lost count, and it grows harder to concentrate the longer we're here) of trying to pass through the traps, discord has seized our search party. We are besieged by nightmares in the dark, and an incessant whispering by day. \n\nA voice in my head torments me with the promise of knowledge immeasurable. I suspect a Daedric presence in this place.\n\n—\n\nMy worst suspicions are now confirmed. Daedra have appeared, called to this place by an unknown voice, and cutting off our retreat. The twins Maelon and Melancthon are now dead, tricked into murdering each other by whatever madness rules this place.\n\nAs for me, I am hopelessly lost. I believe I will die before I find Ibrula or escape this place.\nWould that we had heeded Ibrula's warning and stayed far away.

By the Malachite Chef\n\nCuisinier By Appointment to His Lordship, Chancellor Abnur Tharn\n\nWhat is the secret to easy cooking mastery? It can be summed up in one word: Recipes! When you have a recipe for a dish—especially if it comes from the Malachite Chef!—it takes all the guesswork out of preparing a meal. So beg, borrow, or steal (I jest, I jest) some recipes, acquire the necessary ingredients, and combine as directed over a hot cook-fire. You'll be a master provisioner in no time!\n\nBecause I'll let you in on a little professional secret: nineteen out of twenty times, even top-ranked chefs do exactly the same thing! Oh, we may add a special spice here or there to personalize a recipe, but we know better than to ignore them entirely. A proven recipe represents the collective experience of generations of cooks. Whether you're making something as simple as a Cyrodilic sweet roll or as complicated as a screaming-cheese fondue, in the kitchen a recipe is your best friend!

The ruin known by locals as Hightide Keep was once a sprawling complex of defensive fortifications. A relic from the time of the Ancients, it was painstakingly maintained and manned.\n\nAs a result, Skywatch was able to put up an incredible defense during the Sload attack on the city. Powerful magical constructs were crafted and expended. Dozens of Sload warships were destroyed. \n\nThe city finally fell when a Sload Warcaster filled his voluminous gullet with volatile alchemical reagents and threw himself at the base of the cliffs. The resulting explosion toppled much of the extended rock face, and plunged the ruins into the sea.
By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nAccording to "The Heartland of Cyrodiil," by that old fraud Phrastus of Elinhir, the Nibenese valley and the Colovian hills have always enjoyed the temperate climate they have today, and early references to Cyrodiil as a subtropical jungle were merely errors on the part of one of the Heimskrs.\n\nReally? What, then, of the "waving fronds" of Vahtacen mentioned in the Hosiric Lays? What of Khosey's "dense-jungl'd shore of Rumare" in the Tamrilean Tractates? Are these, as well, the mistakes of errant copyists? \n\nNo, I think it more likely that three millennia ago Cyrodiil's climate was warmer and wetter than it is today.  The environment of the Heartland has changed. Which begs the question: how? \n\nI've given a great deal of thought to this question, and would like to propose a hypothesis. However, I am not a scholar of deep mythohistory like Vanus Galerion or Beredalmo the Signifier, so let's just call the following … a speculation. \n\nTamriel is the center of Nirn; Cyrodiil is the center of Tamriel; and at the center of Cyrodiil stands that greatest of mortal-made structures, the White-Gold Tower of the Imperial City—which was patterned in open emulation of the Adamantine (or Direnni) Tower, the oldest structure in Tamriel, said to have been erected by the Aedra themselves. \n\nThis was no mere homage, whim, or coincidence: White-Gold was built in the semblance of Adamantine in order to echo the first Tower's undeniable mystical properties.  And not just to echo them, but, due to its central location, to amplify them. \n\nWhat are these mystical properties? This leads us to the domain of Tower Lore, a realm fraught with scholarly conflict, but I will try to give a simple, and uncontroversial, summary. \n\nWhen the Aedra were persuaded—or hoodwinked—by Lorkhan into creation of the Mundus, the physical flesh of Nirn was hung on a skeleton of joints, each of which radiated a palpable reality—the bones of the world, as it were. \n\nAt one of these mystical joint-points the Aedra erected a great structure, the Adamantine Tower, where they held a conclave to decide the fate of Lorkhan and the Mundus. In later times mortal mages discovered the Tower, and deduced its reality-affirming properties. The Merethic Elves then imitated it, erecting the White-Gold and Crystal Towers at other joint-points.\n\nIn doing this, what did the Ur-Elves hope to achieve? I would posit that, through their collective "possession" of such Towers in their realms, over time the Elves actually amended their local reality to conform to their desires. \n\nThus the Summerset archipelago, in the sphere of the Crystal Tower, is a warm and paradisiacal domain perfectly adapted to the Altmer. And Cyrodiil, in the sphere of the even-more-powerful White-Gold Tower, became a warm and subtropical jungle—which suited the ease-loving Ayleids. \n\nBut then the slaves of the Heartland High Elves rose up against their masters, conquered the valley of the Nibenay, and the Ayleids ruled no more. Thereafter, White-Gold Tower was the center of a human empire, peopled by Nedes and Cyro-Nords who originated in cooler, northern climes. And so the Tower of Cyrodiil responded to the desires of its new masters. \n\nAnd that, I believe, is the answer to how the Heartland changed from subtropical to temperate: because once Men ruled in Cyrodiil, the local reality changed to meet their needs and wishes. Changed slowly, perhaps, almost imperceptibly, but inexorably—until Cyrodiil became the realm of temperate forests and fields we now know. \n\nSo, is that the truth of the matter? Have I deduced the answer to the mystery? I cannot be sure: I'm only a humble scholar, residing in the Tower of the Fifth Doctrine, which is neither White-Gold nor Adamantine. The only thing I'm quite sure of is that any theory propounded by Phrastus of Elinhir is almost certain to be wrong.
By order of Chief Braadoth, who now wants to be known as the Ophidian Exarch of Undulating Destruction for some reason or another, we are to make sure these special trolls are well cared for. Follow these steps and I won't use you as troll chow.\n\n1. Bathe the trolls in a mix of water, nirncrux-infused mud, and blood.\n2. Massage each troll for at least one hour.\n3.

Repeat every day.\n\n—Gulzog the Butcher
From the Diary of Saradin, Daughter of High King Durac\n\nMy father and Virmaril spent another day and most of the night in the catacombs beneath Skyreach. They share a fascination for the dark arts, but sometimes I wonder if their friendship isn't too complicated. Father bears such a burden as the Nedic High King, and I fear that every time he asks Virmaril for advice he passes a bit of that burden onto my beloved.\n\n* * *\nWe haven't told father of our love as yet, but Virmaril assures me that he will ask father for my hand in marriage in the very near future.\n\n* * *\nFather was furious. Despite his long friendship with Virmaril, he wasn't at all happy with the idea of his beloved daughter marrying a High Elf. I'm heartbroken over this, but I must remain strong. I am the High King's daughter, after all, and I have a duty to my father and my people. No matter how much this outcome pains me. And poor Virmaril. I've never seen him look so … shattered.\n\n* * *\nI'm going to marry King Kestic. Father arranged the marriage to help strengthen ties with Kestic and the northern clans. I still have powerful feelings for Virmaril, but I have to put them behind me. Our love is forbidden, and this marriage will make the Nedic clans stronger. I wonder if Virmaril has moved on with his own life yet?\n\n* * *\nThe barbaric Yokudans gather at our doors. I saw Virmaril and father together today. They both seemed worried. Oh, they try not to let it show, but I know them both so well. Virmaril says he has a plan to repel the invaders. He thinks father will support the idea. They just need to convince the other Nedic kings.\n\n* * *\nVirmaril was watching me throughout tonight's feast. There was a … hunger … in his eyes that I hadn't seen before. Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I could swear that Virmaril had no thoughts about invaders or armies or wars this night. He only had eyes for me.\n\n* * *\nVirmaril came to me in the royal chambers. I was hesitant to talk to him at first, but I didn't want to seem distant. He told me that he still loved me. Asked me to run away with him. I laughed at the idea, assuming he was joking. But I could see in his eyes, his feelings for me were as strong as ever. I turned away before my own emotions betrayed me.\n\n* * *\nVirmaril was cold today, distant. When I asked if he was well, he just said that I had helped him decide his next course of action. As soon as the meeting of the council of kings is over, I'll find Virmaril and apologize. I never meant to hurt him.\n\nI'm sure he'll understand.
By Reginus Buca, Historian, University of Gwylim\n\nWith an equal measure of excitement and trepidation, I begin this series of journals that will one day form the basis of a scholarly work on Skyreach and the ancient Nedic people. The University of Gwylim has generously funded this expedition, in exchange for the exclusive rights to publish at least two books related to the subject at hand.\n\nNote, however, that these journals are not the finished, published work. They contain my observations, theories, and general musings on everything I encounter throughout this trip. The journals will also contain asides by my scholarly partner, Verita Numida, whose theories are usually wildly opposite of anything I propose. I like to think that our differing points of view help to create a more complete picture of the past, but I will admit here, within these pages, that she often drives me into an intellectual rage. Without her support and the addition of her lofty credentials alongside my own, however, I'm not sure this expedition would have come to fruition.\n\nWhy Skyreach? These ancient ruins, we believe, hold the answers to the question that has intrigued us both since we first started looking into Cyrodiil's past. Namely, who were the ancient Nedes, the people who eventually gave rise to the mighty Imperials? I always imagined them to be uncivilized brutes that were as likely to fight each other as they were their enemies, but Verita has constantly insisted that they had to have a more advanced culture than I gave them credit for. Perhaps deep within the ruins of Skyreach, we will settle our argument once and for all.\n\n* * *\nRemarkable! The city of Skyreach appears to extend not only around the Dragontail Mountains, but through them and even beneath them. What an amazing feat of engineering went into the crafting of the place. It appears I have lost at least one argument with Verita. The ancient Nedes were certainly not simply uncivilized brutes. But beyond that, these monoliths have yet to tell us exactly who they were.\n\nWe have begun our investigation in a section of the ruined city we have decided to call "The Hold." Our first goal is to explore the area and come to some conclusions about what daily life must have been like in this Nedic metropolis. Did they utilize both the exterior and interior spaces, or were they primarily dwelling within the space carved from the very heart of the mountain? Perhaps the intricate carvings will provide some clue. \n\nOn first inspection, I theorize that the Nedes built this massive living structure as a private estate for one of their vaunted High Kings. Perhaps it was even the final residence of Durac, the High King that presided over the fall of the Nedes.\n\nVerita, as usual, disagrees. She posits that the commonfolk lived and worked both inside and outside these now-ruined buildings. The evidence we see for what appear to be areas converted into living spaces, she claims, lend credence to the theory that the Nedes retreated into the mountain as a result of the Yokudan invasion. Her theory may be more sound, on further consideration, but I am not yet ready to concede to her on this. Not yet.
Exarch Arnoth,\n\nI look forward to your success within the ruins of Skyreach Hold. I agree that a major source of the nirncrux awaits us in that ancient place. Please make every effort to acquire as much of the red brittle as your trolls can extract.\n\nAnd know that your resolution and steadfast loyalty to the Scaled Court will be remembered.\n\n—Regent Cassipia

By Rallaume Lemonds, Culinary Crusader\n\nI've been pestering Mach-Makka for days. While I've learned a tremendous amount about Argonian cuisine, there is still one dish I have not tried: the Aojee-Sakka. Anytime I request it, Mach-Makka becomes agitated and serves me something else. I suppose his hesitancy is understandable. The Aojee-Sakka is among the most dangerous meals in all of Tamriel. \n\nThe meal actually consists of two dishes served simultaneously. The primary dish is a seared and delicately sliced Aojee Toad on a bed of caramelized figs and cinnamon-grass. The second dish is a bowl of cold hosh (a dark and viscous soup). Neither of these dishes can be consumed alone, as each is a deadly poison. Rather, they must be eaten slowly and simultaneously. One poison serves as the antidote to the other. Eating too much of the toad leads to violent tremors and mouth frothing, followed by death. Eating too much hosh leads to searing intestinal pain and vomiting, followed by death. Not surprisingly, most people avoid this dish, chef and customer alike. But my palate cannot be denied!\n\nI believe that Mach-Makka is at least considering my request. I've brought a small fortune in gold and signed a half-dozen bizarre snake-skin documents (which I can only assume are waivers of some kind). I can practically taste the toad already. My culinary adventure is almost complete!\n\n* * *\n\nI return this book to you, Rallaume-friend. I try to cook Rallaume other foods, but he demands Aojee-Sakka. I cook it for him, but he eats it wrong. Too much toad. I am very sorry he dies.  \n\nHave a good life! We hope you come eat with us, too! But not the Aojee-Sakka.\n\n—Mach-Makka

By Holgunn One-Eye\n\nKing Jorunn wants a description of the Akaviri styles of arms and armor written by someone who knows them. I don't think anyone killed more Akaviri than I did during the recent invasion from Kamal, so I guess that makes me an expert in their wares of war. Besides, who else was I going to get to write this? Rigurt?  \n\nBOOTS\n\nBoots of the northern Akaviri tend to be simple and utilitarian, for trudging through the deep snows of Kamal. Those of the southern Tsaesci are more elaborate and decorative, with shoes and sabatons that look like Imperial sandals, though armored with thick leather or small metal plates.
By Seeker's Archivist Ibrula\n\nStored here in the Seeker's Archive are much of the lost history and wisdom of Yokuda, in books and scrolls brought here by the first of the Ra Gada. It will take many lifetimes to catalogue it all, so we shall start simply, with references to the characteristics that make the Yokudan motifs unique and distinctive, such as the so-called "broad arrowhead" design.  \n\nMACES\n\nThe Yokudans were so attached to the idea of edged blades that they even mounted them on the heads of their maces, where you might find spikes or flanges in another crafting style. Some of these edged blades even came to points in the "broad arrowhead" design.

The medium and heavy girdles shall have sharp, interlocking diamond-shaped plates, so as to cause pain when the belts are used to bind captives.
My investigation is complete as per the Guild's orders. I am providing here a collection of speaking stones from which you can draw your own conclusions. To say that the Empress Regent has been acting erratically is an understatement.\n\nI can't risk exposure any longer.

By Flaminius Auctor, Province General\n\nEven in peaceful times, Daedric Princes doggedly prod at Tamriel, building power and working toward their vile goals. Now, as war erupts across the provinces, it is certain they've doubled their malevolent efforts, and every citizen must be on the lookout for evidence of Daedric activities. As Cyrodiil's Province General for the Fighters Guild, I take my responsibility to educate and protect seriously. Knowledge, which I offer you here, is a mighty weapon—a population that knows what to look for can stop a cult before it manages any large-scale atrocities.\n\nMehrunes Dagon is a particularly nasty character among the gallery of horrors from Oblivion. He revels in destruction on a grand scale, from deaths caused by floods or earthquakes to mass murders, and enjoys making a show of any influence he can exert on Nirn. His penchant for flagrant displays of power makes it no surprise that his cults draw more membership than those of the less conspicuous Princes.\n\nWhat can a regular citizen do, though, in the face of such evil? More than you might think! Everyone can learn to recognize the early signs that a cult might be nearby. Dismantling a cult before it grows to an appreciable size is the most effective way to stamp out Daedric influence and prevent massive summonings, wanton destruction, and other disasters from coming to fruition. This guide will help you recognize the stirrings of Daedric cults, especially those of Mehrunes Dagon:\n\nFirst, be aware of your neighbors. Watch for unexplained changes in their routines or behavior, strange flashing lights in their fields or homes late at night, eerie chanting, and disappearances of farm animals (or, worse, other neighbors). These can all be signs of a budding cult. Be wary of strangers in town who take special interest in outcasts, criminals, or unruly teenagers—all of these are common recruitment targets. \n\nCults of Mehrunes Dagon have some unique characteristics. We in the Fighters Guild have identified the end of Sun's Dusk as a particularly active time for these organizations. If a cult of Dagon operates in your area, you may notice changes in your environment as they attempt to incite disasters—more rain, no rain, or unusual tremors in the ground can all be signs. Dagon cultists also exhibit a sick fascination with setting buildings, animals, and people ablaze and often bear the symbol of a fiery, rising sun. \n\nIf you suspect someone you know of cult involvement, proceed with caution. Even someone close to you can be corrupted, and it is difficult to remove the black roots of Daedric filth once they take hold. Do not hesitate to report your suspicions—if they can be reached early enough, it may be possible to reverse the influence of the cult. For your own safety, do not act alone or attempt to confront a possible cult member. Even a once-trustworthy friend involved with a cult may mean you harm. Report immediately to the Fighters Guild, where professionals can assist you!\n\nArmed with this knowledge, you can aid all of Tamriel in preventing Daedric cults from growing and spreading. Pass this book along to a friend or neighbor and we will stop the Daedric threat together.

It has come to our attention that a group of political activists known as the "Veiled Heritance" has engaged in thievery and the fencing of stolen goods in this area.\n\nWhile the Shadow Artisans normally welcome kindred spirits, this group's recent anti-Dominion activities have not gone unnoticed by Queen Ayrenn's agents. We suspect that drawing the attention of the Eyes of The Queen upon our own operations would be foolish and unnecessarily risky.\n\nWe therefore request all associates refrain from any and all dealings with this group.

To My Lovely Flowering Perennial,\n\nI must bank on the idea that this letter finds you well. You have done more than accrue my interest.

To your credit, you bankrupted my thoughts, allowing me to account for nothing beyond the sweet vault of your embrace.\n\nI have appraised the situation and I feel like I must make this statement at once: We have done more than bond. I know I am forever in your debt. Lend your heart to me and I shall make payment to your kindness in turn. Do not be shy on my account, allow me to deposit my sincerity into this letter.\n\nI shall transfer my love from this letter to your heart,\n\nYour Little Lender Bee
by Nevil Hleran\n\nIf, like the unfortunate author of this text, you have the displeasure of being required by your House to interact with our Nord "allies" and "trade partners" on a regular basis, you'll quickly discover that Nord social interactions are far removed from our complex and dignified Dunmeri culture. My frequent exposure to their habits and behaviors has made me something of an authority on avoiding physical harm when in the company of Nords, and I hope it may assist you, the reader, in the same.\n\nWith Nords, insults are not always insults—unless they are. When conversing among themselves, references that might otherwise seem offensive (like "you old horker's arse") might, in fact, be familiar terms of endearment. One should avoid chiming in with similar epithets unless quite familiar with the Nords in question. Keep in mind, even then, that insulting a Nord's strength, bravery, or honor in any way almost inevitably leads to violence as the offended party attempts to prove otherwise.\n\nNever turn down a drink. You must become an expert at discreetly emptying your sixth or seventh cup of mead underneath the table (don't worry, there will be plenty of spillage already present; no one will notice). Refusing a drink is seen as an admittance of weakness and is a sure way to alienate yourself from those you have been forced to work alongside. \n\nMy last bit of advice is to attempt to speak in the simplest terms possible. Nords, while they do love absurd stories, do not appreciate the finer arts of conversation, and become suspicious of those who speak in elaborate language. A suspicious Nord is a dangerous Nord, likely to go off and begin yelling and throwing accusations that you're deliberately being confusing and must be lying. Keep it simple and you'll avoid bruises.\n\nGood luck, reader. You will need it as you attempt to cooperate with these brutish Men.

When the shield-wife Bagrar first fought in battle, she wielded a two-handed mattock too large for her small frame. Shamed in battle, Bagrar took up the sword and shield. She blushed at being forced to wield smaller weapons, and other warriors, seeing her embarrassment, mocked her.\n\nWith a lighter weapon in hand, Bagrar became a fury on the battlefield. Her sword struck several times before her opponents could counter once, and her shield became impenetrable. She earned the title of Troll-Slayer.\n\nBagrar thanked Malacath for her prowess and dedicated herself, becoming the defender of the faith during the Balagog blood purge, and her shield became known as the Agra Crun—the blood shield.
The Furious One, the Keeper of the Bloody Curse, the Defender of the Betrayed. These are just a few of the great Malacath's many titles, known to his faithful, known to the children of the Sworn Oath.\n\nListen, initiate! Hear, o faithful one! The path you must walk is never easy, but if traversed in the correct and devout manner, it will lead you into the Author of the Code's embrace.\n\nThe shrine in Fharun Keep hides the path to the sanctuary. Only a gift of life's most precious liquid, freely given by the holy curators, will reveal the way.\n\nIn the prayer rooms, those who refuse to follow Malacath's light will forever walk in darkness and never find the Hall of Faith.\n\nIn the Hall of Faith, trust that Malacath will catch you, no matter how far you must fall.\n\nFinally, in the Sanctuary of Sacred Words, only a sacrifice will call forth the teachings of the Furious One.
Skalg, \n\nThis is my last shipment. The wrong eyes are on me now. I thought nobody would notice petty thieves and street scum going missing, but I was wrong. You'll need to find some other means of feeding your forge.\n\nThis last shipment will include the following:\n\nFour Orcs: healthy\nTwo Khajiit: possibly diseased\nThree Bretons: frost-bitten\nTwo Elves: one healthy, one corpse\n\nSorry about the dead one. Couldn't be helped. But you mentioned Elven blood last time, so I left the corpse in with the rest.\n\nAs always, I expect a full delivery of Morkul-forged arms and armor delivered to the usual place.\n\nThreads guide you, my friend.\n\n—Zushruk
There is a creature in the land of the Orcs that defies explanation. The chub loon has no purpose and little known history. However, it is delicious when cooked with moon-sugar glaze and citrus.\n\nI, Zabia-ko, and several companions sought to secure trade with the Orcs of Fharun Stronghold when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the negotiations. We had little choice but to run for our lives when the chief burned our ship and sent warriors after us. The cold and rocky coast overlooking the frigid Sea of Ghosts became our home for the night. The howling sea wind bit deep into our fur. Despite that, sleep eventually came in the dark of the night.\n\nAs the sun rose over the Druadach Mountains, a cacophony of honking sounds broke the rhythmic peace of the waves against the rocks. The others feared some unknown beast had come to eat us, but curiosity overcame this one, and she slipped out of her bedroll, grabbed her staff, and moved toward the coast to let her eyes decide if we should stay or flee. Of all the creatures that have passed before Zabia-ko's eyes, none are stranger than the stub-legged, waddling birds that swarmed the ice floes and rocks. They stood in groups, clumping for warmth, with their useless wings flapping at their sides. Their call, once frightening, sounded comical when I looked upon them.\n\nThe birds were nothing like anything in the old and well-worn wilderness guide I borrowed from the library back home. Escape through the Friendship Gate could wait. This was something new, and new things have value. At first we were very careful to gather a few of the creatures, but we soon learned that they were too stupid to flee from a Khajiit. They had no trouble fleeing from Orcs, though! Any proper prey should try to run away when Khajiit walk among them, but not these flightless birds. We scooped them up and made haste for the gate, lest the Fharun clan catch our scent and give chase.\n\nThis one's first stop in Wayrest was to the Mages Guild. A few pieces of gold gained me access to their natural history library, where a new edition of the wilderness guide was prominently displayed. It mentions the chub loon as an elusive creature that was not observed by earlier writers. How could such an obnoxious creature be overlooked?\n\nThis one spent several days and candle-lit nights going over every tome on the creatures and wildlife of Tamriel. Not a single mention of the chub loon exists before the beginning of the second era. How could that be? The very first mention is in a text on the horker, and it only says that they were moving in on the horker habitat, disrupting the food source. Could it be that, like the Nords and other men, they came from another land? Could the stupid birds have been brought here by travelers from Atmora? Could they have traversed the Sea of Ghosts on their own with only floating chunks of ice to carry them? In any case, no matter how they arrived, they secured a new habitat, flourishing on Wrothgar's rocky coast.
By Exordor Vasidius, Sermonizer, Priest of Akatosh\n\nThe Order of the Hour is one of the oldest knightly orders in the Empire. It was born early in the life of the Empire, during the First Era, and eventually faded into obscurity during the Second Era. It was founded by Ennon Decan as an order of knights dedicated to Akatosh, though originally it drew its members from the priesthood and military alike.\n\nThe most recent incarnation of the Order of the Hour was established in 2E 432 by the warrior-priest of Akatosh, Cavor Merula, in response to the collapse of the Second Empire and the coming of the Longhouse Emperors. Fearing for the safety of the Dragon God priesthood and wanting to protect the Cathedral of Akatosh and its many historic and religiously significant treasures, Cavor gathered a few devoted and trusted fellow priests and dedicated himself and his brothers to the defense of the Cathedral. On that day, the Order of the Hour was reborn.\n\nSoon, devout soldiers and warrior-priests in service to Akatosh began to flock to the Order's banner. The feared retribution against the Divines by the Longhouse Emperors never materialized, however, and the Order of the Hour transformed into a small but elite unit of bodyguards devoted to the Cathedral and its resident Primate, the leader of the Akatosh faith. In many ways, the Order of the Hour developed into a mostly ceremonial organization, although they maintained their training and combat readiness. When the occasional threat did strike from the shadows, the Order was prepared.\n\nTake, for example, the Kvatch bread riots of 2E 467. The common folk, fearful and angry due to the red wheat blight that devastated crops for the second year in a row, decided that Akatosh and his priests weren't doing enough to rectify the situation. Gruff Bojour led an ax- and torch-bearing mob to the very steps of the Cathedral, intent on inflicting violence and making their displeasure known. But the Order of the Hour was ready for the assault, and Sister Severa and her warrior-priests slaughtered half the crowd before even a single torch had been thrown. The Primate promised to pray to end the tribulation, and by the next season the blight had run its course.\n\nOther examples of the bravery and dedication of the Order of the Hour exist, including saving Primate Phrastus from an assassin's blade in 2E 540 and rescuing a caravan of priests and pilgrims from bandits in 2E 561. The Order has never wavered from its vow to serve and protect the Cathedral, and by extension, the priests and worshipers who occupy the holy place.\n\nIn 2E 480, a writ from the Primate of Akatosh authorized the Order to form into an army during times of religious emergencies. Answering only to religious authority, the militarized Order took to the walls of Kvatch to protect the city from a horde of brigands led by the charismatic Orc marauder, Baz Swordbreaker. Thanks to the efforts of the Order, the brigands were defeated and the city saved. Immediately thereafter, the army disbanded and the Order returned to its regular duties at the Cathedral.\n\nRecruits to the Order must be devout followers of Akatosh, unmarried so that they may devote themselves fully to the Order and its intense regimens. While the Order began as a small group of warrior-priests, the organization has recently broadened its acceptance criteria so that non-clergy can undertake the vows. Once indoctrinated into the Order, members undergo enhanced training in combat and skills related to keeping the Cathedral safe.\n\nWhen the Gold Coast isolated itself from Cyrodiil after the Empire collapsed and the Three Banners War began, Artorius Ponticus, Primate of Kvatch, immediately set out to bolster the power and scope of the Order of the Hour. He instructed Commander Marcus Scipio to increase the size of the Order and set about expanding the Order's responsibilities beyond the boundaries of the Cathedral and into the rest of the city of Kvatch. This was done, as the Primate has said on numerous occasions, "To reinforce the capabilities of the Kvatch Guard in these dangerous and troubling times." As anyone can plainly see, the Primate has only the best interests of Kvatch and its people in mind.\n\nWith recent threats against the city and the Cathedral, the Count of Kvatch has granted the Primate of Akatosh emergency powers to once again convert the Order into an army. Today, the Order of the Hour boasts the largest force in the history of the organization. With a mix of devoted warrior-priests and dedicated soldiers of faith filling its growing ranks, the Order now maintains the safety and keeps the peace of not only the Cathedral of Akatosh's grounds, but of all of Kvatch as well. No matter how chaotic things get on the other side of Varen's Wall, on the Kvatch side, the Order has things well in hand.
By Midara Salviticus, Historian, University of Gwylim\n\nWhen Varen Aquilarios left the Gold Coast with the Second Legion to carry his rebellion into the heart of Cyrodiil, he didn't leave his beloved homeland completely unprotected. Between a slim wall that stretched from the shores of the Abecean Sea to the banks of the Strid River and a surrogate champion in the form of his nephew Carolus, Kvatch and the surrounding countryside were spared both the retaliation of the Longhouse Emperor and the degradations of the war that followed. But there were still plenty of opportunities for the Wolf of Kvatch to take on the Imperial Dragon.\n\nCarolus Aquilarios idolized his uncle and was eager to help when Varen declared open rebellion against the Emperor. In fact, Carolus wanted to join Varen and fight alongside him as he marched toward the Imperial City. But Varen had other plans for Carolus. He wanted someone he could trust to protect the homefront—someone like his honorable nephew. Disappointed not to be beside Varen and in the midst of the action, Carolus nevertheless vowed to keep Kvatch and its people safe, just as his uncle knew he would. He immediately assumed temporary command of the County of Kvatch.\n\nShortly after Varen and the majority of Second Legion departed the Gold Coast, the Imperial Prefect of Anvil and Ephrem Benirus, the Count of Anvil, sent Imperial forces stationed in the coastal city inland to seize Varen Aquilarios's property and holdings. Carolus rallied the single cohort of the Second Legion that Varen left in his command, as well as the Kvatch Warders—the famed defenders of the city. Kvatch's defenders met the Imperial forces on the plains below the city. The battle was short and fierce, ending with the remnants of Anvil's forces—now greatly reduced—retreating back the way they had come. The Wolf of Kvatch had repelled an attack by the Imperial Dragon.\n\nBefore the year was out, Anvil sent its dwindling Imperial troops against Kvatch three more times, and each time they came away beaten and fewer than they were before. Then, word reached the region that Varen Aquilarios had ascended to the Ruby Throne. Carolus, who was being called the Wolf of Kvatch for his bravery and leadership, officially inherited the title of Count of Kvatch and took the wolf's head symbol as his own. \n\nUnfortunately, Kvatch's good fortune wouldn't last long. As soon as Carolus was officially named as Count of Kvatch, Artorius Ponticus, Primate of Kvatch, began working to undermine the count's authority and carve out more power and influence for himself. Always ambitious and powerful in his own right as the religious authority of Cyrodiil, the Primate had a grudgingly civil relationship with Varen, and had put aside his ambitions while Carolus struggled to keep Kvatch safe. With the change in regime in the capital, however, it appeared that the Primate sought a more influential position in the city's hierarchy. Before this challenge could come to a head, however, something significant occurred in Anvil.\n\nBut that's a tale for another book.
By the Red Asp, Hallin's Stand Thieves Guild\n\nWe Outlaws may not be very organized, but we have our ways of recognizing each other, no matter where we come from—our symbols, like the three-bladed dagger, or code phrases such as—actually, I don't think I'll write those down in a book. However, since we're all involved in the same illicit business, you'll see there's a common style to our arms and armor. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nFor an Outlaw, having to don your shield means your job has taken a nasty turn for the worse—but that's when you're glad you crafted a sturdy one, with a riveted steel edge to turn a guard or constable's weapon. We usually display the Outlaws' three-bladed dagger on the boss, because if you have to show your shield, the cat, as they say, is already out of the bag.
Dearest Mother, \n\nI remember your name. I have surrounded myself with lying liars and have become a liar myself, but in my lies I see the manifestation of your domain as clearly as the blood we spill in the shadows of a secret murder. So even though I wish to scream truth in their faces or whisper your name into the ear of the dying, I tell myself that the secret is my faith, my joy and not a blasphemy. \n\nYet just once I wish for you to speak to me. Why not me? I have listened for you always. I cloaked myself in you long before they called me Dark Sister. I was the Chimera, ever shifting and changing and lying a thousand thousand lies for you. To be seen by you. To hear you. They call themselves Listener, but no one listens for your whisper with more hope and desire than I do.\n\nI have walked in accordance with your Arts, shrouded in Eight Shadows. I have lived lies and ended lives, not for the Dread Father but for you. They call themselves Speakers, but no one has spoken your words with as much conviction as I do.\n\nDo you see the shrine that I have built? A shrine of my body. Every face a lie, the envy both elicited and felt. The mastery of seduction. The embrace and instillment of fear, the betrayal of family and truth. The murder of others, the murder of self. The insatiable want. The fury I feel and release and feel again at you, you, you when all treasures are nothing but lies.\n\nDearest Mother, I remember your name. But I will speak the lie and love the lie if you wish. Perhaps that is your lesson. The treasure is the lie.
By the Venerable Uugus, Priest of Trinimac\n\nThe Elves have forgotten the warrior ideals of Trinimac, but we Orsimer keep them alive! As the Children of Trinimac, we embody his stoic courage and bold audacity. The arms we bear and the armor we wear shine with gold, in remembrance of Trinimac's golden skin. And they are accented with polished ebony, in token of Lorkhan's blood when Trinimac tore out his heart. \n\nBELTS\n\nFor the worshiper of Trinimac, the belt symbolizes the faith in the Golden Champion that binds the Orsimer together. Its buckle evokes the Champion's golden helmet, surrounding a quartz crystal that represents the clarity of Trinimac's vision.

Ebonheart Pact Arms and Armor\n\nBy General Holgunn One-Eye\n\nI'm no writer, Jhunal knows, but here I am, taking up the quill again at the behest of King Jorunn—or his advisors, anyway. I haven't seen that young rascal of a monarch in days. Wonder what he's getting up to? \n\nAnyway: I'm supposed to summarize what our alliance arms and armor should look like, so the smiths and armorers all make them to uniform standards. I guess I can do that—by Shor's stones, I've seen enough of them!\n\nDAGGERS\n\nWhen it came to choosing a design for our Pact daggers, we turned to the Dark Elves, because when it comes to sticking somebody in the back—no, maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, you'll see the crossguard is adapted from Tribunal symbology, though we did slap a Dragon on it.
This is to remind all Iron Wheel officers and soldiers serving within our temporary headquarters is an honor and privilege. Those members of our command who would rather patrol the area outside the Citadel are welcome to apply for transfer at any time. Hot-weather gear and rain slickers will be provided as necessary.\n\nFor those who would rather remain in the cool, comfortable interior of this complex, please remember to comport yourself as Iron Wheel, not common soldiers:\n\n—Sneaking off into the secret passages will be seen as an application for transfer.\n—Dangling your feet from the catwalk above the main storage area will be seen as an application for transfer. Be sure to ask Demi-Lieutenant Atriunia if dawdling was worth his time.\n\nRefusing to do "servant's work" in the interior will not be seen as an application for transfer. However, I will personally interpret it as a request to clean out the latrines which haven't been maintained in nearly two thousand years.\n\n—Rhanbiq, CI-IW

By Vivec\n\nSermon Twenty-One\n\nThe Scripture of the Wheel, First:\n\n"The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking. That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action."\n\nSecond:\n\n"They are the lent bones of the Aedra, the Eight gift-limbs to SITHISIT, the wet earth of the new star our home. Outside them is the Aurbis, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite. The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters. Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed."\n\nThird:\n\n"The enlightened are those uneaten by the world."\n\nFourth:\n\n"The spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen, the signal shapes of the Demon Princedoms. It is the key and the lock, series and manticore."\n\nFifth:\n\n"Look at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors made idols from. Look at its center and all you see is the begotten hole, second serpent, womb-ready for the Right Reaching, exact and without enchantment."\n\nSixth:\n\n"The heart of the second serpent holds the secret triangular gate."\n\nSeventh:\n\n"Look at the secret triangular gate sideways and you see the secret Tower."\n\nEighth:\n\n"The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I."\n\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI.

I build for you a city of swords, by which I mean laws that cut the people who live there into better shapes."\n\nThird:\n\n"Girls burn their dresses on my arrival if I am armored. They crawl to me as bled pilgrims. Minor spirits die without trace. Follow me of all the ALMSIVI if you are to mark your days with killing.

He cuts sleep holes in the middle of a battle to regain his strength."\n\nFifth:\n\n"Instinct is not reflex action, but mini-miracles held in reserve. I am the welfare that decides which warrior will emerge. Beg not for luck. Serve me to win."\n\nSixth:\n\n"The span of the apparently inactivated is your love of the absolute.

At-Addin Syndicate Memo: Outfitting the Abah's Landing Watch\n\nI just sold that Iron Wheel outfit a load of first-quality arms and armor—good enough that our own Abah's Landing guards are going to look shabby in comparison, and that's not going to do. We need to show a united front to the Wheel, with a standardized look to our guards. Based on what we've got in the warehouses, let's equip them as indicated below. \n\n—Merchant Lord Orahan at-Addin\n\nSHIELDS\n\nEven after equipping the Iron Wheel, we still have a lot of those round shields faced with the double-crescent design. Put a slightly different tint on them and issue those to our guards.
By Twilight Cantor Adara'hai\n\nSomewhere, deep in the Dark Behind the World, there are grim forges and bent benches where Lost Cats arm and armor themselves. On those dire times when they appear among us, their outfitting is much alike, implying they are made to certain standards. This one shall sing the song of these standards below. Because all knowledge is useful, no? If only to know what to stay away from. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nDouble-waning-crescent shield, Jode to right, Jone to left, with gaps in moon-sickles for stab-stabbing from behind it. See the blue lightning? Very dangerous: beware.
I do not know who the lady in the cistern used to be. But truly, it no longer matters who the statue was.\n\nYou see, I believe the statue now represents Zeira.

By Frikkhild Coldheart of The Anvil & Pauldron\n\nThe Ebony style of arms and armor: so striking, so strange, so distinctive that there's no mistaking it. But how are we to account for its bizarre admixture of stylistic forms, Dunmer, Nord, and even Daedric? Where does it come from, and who established it? I have spent years seeking the answers to these questions, and all I have for my pains are a few names and terms that may (or may not) apply. Mackkan. Caldera. Fickledire. "Glorious Upheaval." I wish I knew what these words mean, but I do not. I only know that the Ebony style is ancient, and can be defined as described below. \n\nAXES\n\nThe Ebony-style axe is notable for its oversized single blade, twice as long below the axle as above it. There is a spike opposite the blade, and another one, curved, at the ferrule.
Assassins League Style\nBy the Gray Maybe\n\nThe "Dark Brotherhood"? Utter nonsense. The Brotherhood is a myth. A legend. A lie. Death comes to us all, and murder is merely a matter of mundane craft—there's no need to invoke the Void, or its, ahem, mother. \n\nAh, but a secret society of assassins, a guild of killers for hire—now that makes sense. That's just good business. And like every good business, we have standards. You wish to join us, and dress like one of our league? Then follow the instructions below. And one day, if you are found worthy, you may be invited to learn some actual secrets. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nFor the League, a shield usually comes into play on two-person missions, where one assassin is using it to cover a second killer who's picking a lock or lining up a shot. So the shield must be large enough to crouch behind, but with cutouts to left and right so one can stab or shoot around it.
By Narsis Dren—Treasure Hunter\n\nSo, you want to be able to pass yourself off as a Draugr? That makes perfect sense! Done it myself, and more than once! Just follow my instructions below, and you'll have gear so Draugr-y not even a Dragon Priest's mother could tell it from the real thing! After all, if you're going to imitate my exploits recovering relics from ancient Nord tombs, in theory it will go much easier if it looks like you belong there! \n\nAnyway, that's the theory. \n\nSTAVES\n\nDraugr revenants schooled in "the clever art" don't cast a lot of happy healing and light spells, so for authenticity, make sure your Draugr staff has a dark and sinister look to it. You can't go wrong with dried bloodstains on the head and haft, in my experience.
Boundless Eternity Awaits Us\n\nIanus Faleria \n\nDied S Dawn 19 421\n\nAge 35 years
By Lady Augustine Viliane, Sibyl of the House of Dibella\n\nThe skies over Wayrest are stormy and changeable, more often gray than blue, but some mornings in Second Seed the sun rises into heavens blue and clear, and a mild, warm breeze blows in from the Iliac Bay. It was on just such a morning, under trees fragrant with blossoms, that I was welcoming several new novices to their vocation in the House of Dibella. \n\nThey were full of questions, as the young always are. "Holy Sibyl," asked a young oyster-catcher from Aldcroft, "is love truly the answer to every question?"\n\n"It is—if the question addresses the heart," said I. "Rarely if it addresses the mind."\n\n"Holy Sibyl?" asked the shy engraver from Alcaire. "Is it true we must dance for the worshipers while … unclad?"\n\nI smiled. "That is as your spirit shall will—and as the weather shall allow!"\n\n "I have one, Holy Sibyl," said the clever child of a Wayrest banker. "If the Aedra sacrificed themselves, each to add something to the making of the world, what did Our Lady contribute to the world?"\n\nIn reply, I scooped a double handful of fallen blossoms from the sward and rained them over his astonished brow. \n\n "I am troubled, Holy Sibyl," said the hostler from Northpoint, "for I know not who is my father."\n\n"That is naught to the Goddess of Beauty," I gently replied, "for she says, 'No matter the seed, if the shoot is nurtured with love, will not the flower be beautiful?'"\n\n"What if a congregant seeks me as ardor-partner," said the knight's scion of Evermore, "but I find her without favor?"\n\n"Love whomever you may," I sang, "but love coerced is not love at all."\n\n"Holy Sibyl, is it true what they s-say," stammered the owlkeeper's heir, "that you lost your s-sight from the Great Flu?"\n\n"It is," I smiled, "but what of that? For can I not dance?"\n\n"Holy Sibyl!" "Holy Sibyl!"\n\n"Peace, young novices!" I cried. "For it is Fredas, the bell tolls sundown, and the congregants await us in the chapel. Come, now! Come! Bring wine, bring tambours, bring light feet and warm hearts! Our Lady calls us to worship."
Your package has been secured and your advance payment received. We're set. When you see the Rowdy Guar docked, meet me past midnight on the pier to take your delivery.\n\nYou'll be looking for a sealed barrel marked with a blue blaze on the staves. Place your bag of gold on top of the barrel where I can see it. That's when we'll make the exchange.\n\nOnce I count your gold, we tip the barrel on its side and you roll it right off the docks to your home, just like you'd do with apples or fish. I have an understanding with the dockmaster, so none of the Red Sails will stop you. If one does, just tell them you're delivering "mouse meat." They'll get the message.\n\nIf you're worried about any noise or shouting from inside the barrel, don't be. I'll take care of that before we land with a special potion of my own design. Your package will be absolutely quiet the whole way home, even if you roll and jostle it on the road. I'll give you another potion to counteract the first.\n\nI'm certain you'll be more than satisfied with my delivery. But, whenever you get tired of this one, I can have you another in days, if you wish. There's always more where this came from, if you've got the gold.
\nNo matter how beautiful the darkness may be, the dawn destroys it when the sun finally rises.
Boss,\n\nThe survey requested by the League of Kwama Miners is nearly complete at the site. Prospects appear to be real good. The conditions are perfect for seeding a new Kwama hive, provided another queen is born before Frostfall.\n\nIf we can't get a viable hive going before that time, we may have to abandon the caverns until the thaw to save on costs. Who knows what could move in between the time of our departure and return? It'd be a crying shame to lose this mine, I'll tell you that.\n\nWe'll continue with our scheduled work until we receive word to the contrary, so keep me posted about any changes that will affect us.\n\nKwama Miner Dabruun

GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE\nBy Chamberlain Haskill\n\nMy Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to create "Grim Harlequin" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than write manuals for mortals? \n\nActually, almost anything, now that I think about it. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nGrinning skulls, fool's-capped jester faces, diamond quilting, those curving sharp what-you-may-call-em motifs: the Grim Harlequin shield has it all, really. Strap this on your off-arm, and they'll get out of your way in the grocery store, believe me.
DARK BROTHERHOOD STYLE\nBy Speaker Terenus\n\nHeed me, Initiates:  we are not soldiers, and do not wear a uniform—it would be a difficult thing indeed to do our jobs if we had to wear gear that identified us as members of an order of assassins. But just because we don't typically use uniforms when on assignment doesn't mean we don't have them: we do. When it is necessary for you to represent the Dark Brotherhood in a manner that leaves no doubt as to our involvement in an affair, you will wear guild armor and wield guild arms as described below. \n\nBOOTS\n\nAn Initiate's boots shall be of flexible leather for maximum mobility. The uppers shall bear the broad steel dart, toe-ward, for protection of the instep. The sole shall be ridged for traction.
By Nonus Caprenius, Temporarily Unaffiliated Scholar of Imperial Antiquities\n\nWould you do honor to the noble and all-but-forgotten race of Minotaurs, those mighty man-beasts who symbolized the Empire of yore? Do you believe in the legends of their greatness, as I do? Listen, then, and I shall teach you how to craft a set of arms and armor that will pay appropriate tribute to these nigh-extinct avatars of ancient Alessia! \n\nSHIELDS\n\nThe shield of the Minotaurs has a diamond shape for its central boss, but one should expect such Imperial iconography on the arms of a race so deeply linked to the early history of Cyrodiil. It's an all-metal shield, and thus heavy—if one isn't a Minotaur. Ordinary mortals may make them thinner and lighter.

Do you believe in the legends of their greatness, as I do? Listen, then, and I shall teach you how to craft a set of arms and armor that will pay appropriate tribute to these nigh-extinct avatars of ancient Alessia! \n\nSHOULDERS\n\nThe mighty and muscular shoulders of the Minotaurs are simulated by heavy pauldrons that rise almost to the neck, and overlap the gorgets on the over-armored right arms. Here again we see the influence of the armor of arena gladiators, which begs the question: did the Minotaurs imitate the gladiators, or vice-versa?
By Amminus Entius, First Quartermaster of the Order\n\nThe Order of the Hour is the defensive arm of the Chantry of Akatosh, and as well-disciplined knights of the Order, you must at all times properly represent the dignity and glory of the ancient Imperial worship of the Dragon God of Time. Though the Order is not technically a part of the Imperial hierarchy, we nonetheless embody the virtues of the old Empire—and our equipment must reflect those virtues as well. \n\nGLOVES\n\nA rigid upper gauntlet protects the forearms of Knights of the Order of the Hour, ornamented with swirling time mists, and perhaps an Imperial diamond or Akatosh hourglass. The gloves that cover the hand are made of supple kid leather, to facilitate the grip of our weapons.
To the Council and esteemed members of Great House Telvanni\n\nI, Magister Therana of Tel Branora, do hereby request and support the elevation of the slave Argonian, Sun-in-Shadow, to rank within our House. She should be lifted from the slave caste and established as a ranked Hireling as soon as possible. \n\nSun-in-Shadow has shown great initiative and a capacity for careful planning. Her actions, both direct and indirect, led to the acquisition of a valuable relic—an item vital to my research. The fact that she accomplished this feat while still in shackles speaks volumes.\n\nThe Council is no doubt aware of Sun-in-Shadow's magical aptitude. Despite her racial handicap, she shows great promise—particularly in the realm of alteration and conjuration. Such talent demands cultivation. The House shall profit from her work, I have no doubt.\n\nHonor and Regards,\nTherana\nMagister of the Great House Telvanni\nMaster of Tel Branora
Let it be known:\n\nHeterodox religious practice is hereby banned within the city limits of Vivec. This includes, but is not limited to, veneration of the Eight Apostasies, Hist sap or moon-sugar rituals, devotional Malacathian bloodsport, and Daedric rites of communion. Any citizen who takes part in such ceremonies shall be jailed and subjected to corporal reeducation. Any non-citizen who takes part in such ceremonies shall be banished or executed, depending on the severity of the infraction and the judgment of the attending Ordinator. In either case, all devotional materials and literature shall be seized and burned in the Pyres of Purification. Such is the price of blasphemy.\n\nKeep to the Tribunal or keep silent.\n\nVictory for the Three,\n\nInquisitor Nivos Uveran
Don't let anyone else see this note. Not even our comrades can be trusted.\n\nWe've got to give this one up. Coin isn't worth our lives. You haven't seen it yet. What I've seen. But they're talking about sending us back in to try to deal with the mess, and believe me, they won't be paying enough for that.\n\nProblem is, Rethan has some real loyalists in our ranks. They'll kill us if we try to run too early. Got a plan though. Lema is making the squads and planning the route. We'll get ourselves split from the rest and then make a break for it. If this is as bad as I hear it is, they'll probably just assume we died and never come looking for us. We can always find work somewhere else.
Notes on the meeting with Chodala, Nerevarine and Wielder of Sunna'rah.\nCompiled by Scribe Dakin.\n\nKund-Ud greeted Ashkhan Chodala as Gulakhan Yus-Zashten and Nibapor the Firebreather looked on. Chodala displayed no fear and showed Kund-Ud a level of respect rarely given to tribal outcasts. We had lent him the use of a small warband of Red Exiles, but now he was here to negotiate a more permanent arrangement.\n\nChodala began the meeting by explaining his plans for tribal unification, stressing that there was a place for the Red Exiles in his unified vision.\n\nKund-Ud demanded to know why the Red Exiles should even consider returning to the tribes that banished them. Chodala appeared thoughtful before he replied. "Because you are Ashlanders, and our blood calls one to another."\n\nThen Chodala demonstrated the power of the staff our warband helped him acquire. He called the staff Sunna'rah. "Sunna'rah grants me the strength of a god," Chodala said, striking a stone with the tip of his staff so that the stone cracked like the shell of an egg.\n\nKund-Ud ordered his champion, Gulakhan Yus-Zashten, to put the blasphemous Ashkhan in his place. But no matter how many times her sword lashed out, it never once touched or pierced Chodala's flesh.\n\n"What kind of creature are you?" Kund-Ud demanded.\n\n"I am the Nerevarine," Chodala proclaimed, and Kund-Ud, Gulakhan Yus-Zashten, and Nibapor prostrated themselves before him.\n\n"The Red Exiles shall be my enforcers and Yus-Zashten shall be my champion," Chodala declared. "Prepare yourselves for my return. I have much work for you to do."\n\n"Where are you going, Nerevarine?" Kund-Ud asked.\n\n"I need time to meditate upon our next course of action," Chodala said. "Then I have a meeting with the Wise Woman Dovrosi to ratify my claim as the Nerevarine."\n\nChodala departed and Gulakhan Yus-Zashten went with him, thus ending the meeting.
By Armsman Omeeta, Stormhold Fighters Guildhall\n\nI try to catalogue the arms and equipment of all the deep marsh tribes—it helps our fighters identify who and what we're up against. This Mazzatun gear, with its panoply of plumes and avian and reptilian skulls, is particularly garish. That's fine by me: it makes identifying it all the easier. What follows are brief descriptions of arms and armor of Mazzatun origin, both for the record and for the use of guild fighters in the field. \n\nBELTS\n\nBelts range from sashes of cloth and fur, to intricately woven and braided leather or fibers. One thing is consistent, if not make or material: the spiraling path sigil of Mazzatun is featured prominently at the navel. If there's any significance to that, I'm sure there are eight books on the subject you can reference at the Mages Guild.

What follows are brief descriptions of arms and armor of Mazzatun origin, both for the record and for the use of guild fighters in the field. \n\nCHESTS\n\nThe primary protective material of Mazzatun gear is bone, and while it might not seem like much, it's deceptively effective. Layers of bone splints offer protection and flexibility nearly as good as steel scale mail, and thick horns, tusks, etc. will stop even a forceful strike. Mazzatun armorers appear to lack the means to adequately protect the abdomen, so their warriors are most vulnerable at their bellies.
By Bathed-in-Steel, First Armorer of Stormhold\n\nFirst of all, a warning: do not be so careless as to allow these instructions to fall into the wrong hands! If the authorities in Stormhold knew I was hiring out-of-work smiths to create arms and armor for the Silken Ring, my head would soon be adorning a pike on the Big Bridge! \n\nSecond of all: follow these instructions to the letter. You don't want a secret society of assassins irritated at you because you made them squeaky boots. Pay attention, hatchling, and we'll all profit.\n\nCHESTS\n\nThe signature identifying feature of a Silken Ring uniform, aside from their creepy masks, is a wide band of silver (not silk, don't ask me) that encircles the collar. This may be layered or permanently affixed, but should prominently feature the curved "tangled web" embossing that the Silken Ring prefers for embellishment.
From "The History of Histories, As Told to Young Prince Fahara'jad"\n\nKnow then, O Prince, that after the Ra Gada had swept across Hammerfell, driving all the tusk-folk before it, a time of peace befell whereupon the people who were once Yokudans were able to lay down the sword and take up the shovel and trowel. And for three spans of a person's life all the Redguards did delve and build, and many were the Great Works that were erected above the sands. And few did study the Way of the Sword, for all were constructing monuments to the greatness of our people. \n\nNow east of the Alik'r and south of the Pass of Bangkorai the ever-laudable Queen Ojwa did cause to have built a city of splendor, all white stone and fluted columns, and the city was named Ojwambu, after its thrice-eminent monarch. And its streets and broad avenues were replete with houses and halls devoted to all the arts, both mercantile and inspirational. The people strolled the streets bedecked in fine garments and bedizened with bright jewels, and partaking of delicate viands and hearkening to tunes both rousing and restful. And all was pleasing thereby.\n\nIn an unconsidered corner in the shadow of the walls stood the city's Hall of the Virtues of War, and there did the worthy Hallin, being the Last of the Ansei, teach such of Ojwambu's youth as were yet so inclined the Way of the Sword. Now these youths were few, and though they suffered raillery and unkind badinage from their peers, they found the aging Hallin an inspiration nonetheless, and learned the Way of the Sword until they became true Redguard warriors. And this was well, as you shall see. \n\nFor in the mountain range called Dragon's-Tail the tusk-folk still lurked, beating their breasts and rending their ragged garments in rage and grievance against the Redguards. And among them was a great Goblin Warlord who had escaped the Curse of Divad through a chicanery, and thus had not been diminished. This giant Goblin was possessed of both slyness and sinew, and long he worked among the tribes of Dragon's-Tail, until one day he awoke to find himself Warlord of all the tusk-folk therein. And his name was Mahgzoor Rockhand. So Mahgzoor raised his great blade Bone-Hewer, and roared in a mighty voice like an earthquake, and declared that the day of vengeance at last was at hand. \n\nThen Mahgzoor led his Endwise Army down from the Dragon's-Tail, and it swept into Hammerfell like a great sandstorm, and none could stand before it. The people of the Fallen Waste fled before the fury of the tusk-folk, and many and many were those who sought refuge behind the walls of Ojwambu, until the city was overfilled thereby. The citizens cried out in distress and apprehension, saying, "Who will fight for us, O Queen Ojwa? For we have become artisans and pleasance-wrights, and have forgotten the Way of the Sword."\n\nAnd Queen Ojwa spake, saying, "Are there none among us who remember the Way of the Sword?" Then venerable Hallin stepped forward and bowed before his monarch, saying, "I remember the Way of the Sword, O My Queen, or at least as much as I may, for I am the Last Ansei. What I can do, I shall."\n\nHallin's students then stepped forward as well, and laid their swords at the feet of their queen. But the thrice-eminent Ojwa was dismayed by their fewness, and spake distraught, saying, "How shall we repel the Endwise Army with so few blades? For the tusk-folk are as numberless as the sand in the dunes."\n\nBut Hallin was nowise deterred, and said boldly, "Take heart, O Illustrious Majesty. For your people are Redguards, which means they come easily to the Way of the Sword, and once they have their hands once again on the hilts of blades, and learn to quote once more from the Book of Circles, they will be a match for any folk in all the round world, be they ever so numberless."\n\n"Be that as it may, venerable Ansei," replied Queen Ojwa, "but even Redguards need time to learn the Way of the Sword, and of time we have but little."\n\n"Then you must have more. Finding you a store of time shall be my task, the culmination of the work of my life, and I swear upon Onsi's bright blade you shall have it." And he drew his blade, yea, even in the presence of the queen, and swore an oath upon the Brotherhood and Sisterhood of the Blade. And behold, Hallin seemed to grow to the stature of a giant, and a light shone from his blade's sharp edge, and all were obliged to avert their gaze. \n\nYet when they were able to look once more, they saw naught but the venerable Hallin, smiling and sheathing his blade. And the Last Ansei raised his hands, as if to embrace all the people of Ojwambu, and said, "Fellow Redguards, to you I bequeath the knowledge of the Book of Circles, which we have guarded long and well, that you may be equal to all threats whatsoever. These my students shall teach you their learning, and in good time you will all know once more the Way of the Sword."\n\nHe turned then to Queen Ojwa and said, "Now lead your people, O Mighty Monarch, for that is what you do best. Take them to the west, and spread the word of the Way of the Sword, that Hammerfell might make itself ready for the Endwise Army. I shall abide here in your city, which I and the other Ansei shall defend so long as we may, until our people are ready to fight for themselves."
So Queen Ojwa took the venerable Hallin at his word and forthwith ordered her people to march west toward Alik'r, while daily drilling from the Book of Circles. But Queen Ojwa did more: as she was a wise queen she was an Owl-Friend, and had decreed that all owls were to be honored and none slain. And in return the owls did many a favor for her. So the queen did call the Father of Owls, and asked him to bide in Ojwambu and observe Hallin's defense. "For I would learn," she said, "how one man shall defend a city entire."\n\nEven as the last of the people of Ojwambu departed from her gates to take the secret ways to Alik'r, the scouts of the tusk-folk appeared in the east, where they were noted by Hallin, for though he was old, his eyes were keen.\n\nThen Hallin spake, though there was none to hear but the Father of Owls, saying, "As the snake sheds its skin, so shall the Ansei rise anew from the husks of the past." He raised his sword and cried, "Sisters! Brothers! I summon you to the succor of your people, for time folds upon itself, and then-time is now."\n\nAnd he gestured with his blade to the left, and all along the battlements to the north there was a rustling as of snakeskins, and lo: there arose along the parapets the shadows of a legion. And there stood the semblances of all the female Ansei who ever were, and they turned to Hallin and saluted. So Hallin gestured likewise to the right, and along the battlements to the south there was a rustling, and lo: there arose the semblances of all the male Ansei who ever were. And they likewise saluted Hallin, and then all, north and south, drew their bright blades, and stood on the battlements awaiting. \n\nThe scouts of the tusk-folk stopped forthwith to observe the defenses of Ojwambu. Surprised were they to see the battlements lined with goodly warriors, for they had been told that the folk of the city had forgot the Way of the Sword. So they did consult among themselves as to who would carry this news to Warlord Mahzgoor, and quarrel and quibble, for they feared the bearer of such news would have his head struck off. But finally the smallest, with many blows, was made to carry the report back to the Warlord. \n\nSo the scout reported to Mahzgoor that, unaccountably, the walls of Ojwambu were lined with many goodly defenders. Of an instant the Rockhand struck off the scout's head, but then he took thought, for he was possessed of both slyness and sinew. And his thoughts were, "What matter? We are as numberless as the sand in the dunes. We shall surround this Ojwambu, leaving neither entry nor egress. We shall despoil their fields of its provender, and stop up the streams of their flow, until no one within shall have to eat or to drink. And thus the city shall fall."\n\nSo Mahzgoor ordered, and so it came to pass. The tusk-folk took their leisure among the spoils of the outworks, casting jeers and taunts at the defenders on the walls. But the defenders replied naught. So Mahzgoor and his army waited, amusing themselves most abominably at the expense of their prisoners, secure that in time the defenders of Ojwambu must wither and dwindle. \n\nBut it was not so. Even long after when the Warlord's bone-counters calculated there must be no more to eat or to drink within the city, the defenders stood still stalwart and saying naught. So Mahzgoor summoned his shamans, saying, "Shamans! Have we been befooled by the perfidious Redguards? Are these goodly warriors we see lining the battlements, or are they but shadows?"\n\nSo the shamans cast the portents, and sacrificed twin infants, and sent a scullion to the East Gate whom Hallin did spear from above. And they returned and said, "Nay, mighty Mahzgoor, we are not befooled, for these are goodly warriors we see lining the battlements. But how they may stand when they have not to eat or to drink, this we cannot tell."\n\nOf an instant Mahzgoor struck off the shamans' heads, then raised bloody Bone-Hewer and cried, "To arms! Form ranks! For tonight we drink the blood of the defenders of Ojwambu!"\n\nOf that battle, no living Redguard survived to tell the tale. But nonetheless did wise Queen Ojwa hear of it in full, for the Father of Owls did bear the tale to her ear. He told of how Hallin and his Ansei withstood the assault, yea, for seventeen days. But though they were goodly warriors, over time the Ansei did dwindle, though each left behind only a husk like unto a snakeskin. Finally only Hallin stood at the East Gate, which was burst open by Warlord Mahzgoor with Bone-Hewer held high. And Hallin did seem to grow to match him in size, and the two met sword to sword. \n\nLong and long their blades clashed, until finally as the moons rose the Rockhand smote Hallin such a blow that he was struck to the ground. But even as he fell Hallin, who knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, swung his sword and struck off the head of the Warlord Mahzgoor. Then both were dead, but in death only one was smiling and serene. \n\nQueen Ojwa nodded to hear this news, and said, "It is well." And she turned to her mighty army of Redguard warriors, each of which knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, and said, "Redguards! March we now to retake our lands from the tusk-folk. And when we have regained our splendid city once more, we shall rename it Hallin's Stand. And so it shall be."\n\nAnd so it has been, ever after.
Unto the Doyen of Satakalaam:\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that this unworthy one must report a cessation of the Motalion Endeavor. Circumstances have eventuated that render its continuance inadvisable. Indeed, pursuing the Endeavor would doubtless lead to a loss of Guild lives, as well as being sacrilegious (even more than usual). \n\nI hasten to point out that no taint of fault should be inferred as to the perfection of your peerless plans, O my Doyen. Following your instructions, our subversion of Motalion Funerary Overseer Parvizh al-Tigonus went flawlessly—indeed, he was willing to accept only 15 percent of the pillaging proceeds when we were willing to go as high as 20 percent. In the weeks since he agreed to our proposal, the looting of the crypts and mausoleums in the southern quadrant of the necropolis was accomplished according to Your Doyenhood's admirably aggressive schedule, despite the back injury suffered by Footpad Quyen in the Crypt of Virtuous Maidens.\n\nThe harvesting and sale of the Sacred Welkynds was likewise a complete success, and your idea of substituting imitation stones of turquoise glass treated with glow-spells has left none the wiser. The cost of paying Affab the Illuminary to renew the glow-spells once every ten-day is scarab-feed compared to what we were able to realize from the welkynd stones on the thaumaturgical after-market. \n\nIn hindsight, your advice that we start with the quadrant wherein were interred the most affluent of our ancestors fully justifies the eminent position in which you find yourself. Though we refrained, of course, from irreverent treatment of the sarcophagi, the valuable trappings and regalia of the outer tombs were stripped during those periods when Overseer Parvizh had the watchmen patrolling elsewhere. It is unlikely that the eastern and western quadrants, where the less prosperous of our brethren are buried, would even together equal the take brought in from the southern. \n\nBut now I must reluctantly turn to the reason for our regrettable abandonment of Your Doyenhood's supremely excellent Motalion Endeavor. The northern quadrant, where the authorities have seen fit to bury the corpses of those who were impious or criminal in life, has been afflicted by a horrific rising of undead. Ra-Netu in numbers have crawled from their crypts, and are now a profane presence across the entire necropolis. This may be due, as I believe, to Overseer Parvizh sending the watchmen too often into the unclean quadrant, or it may be the result of some other desecration. If it was the fault of the Overseer, he has certainly paid the price, as he was one of the first victims of these risen dead. \n\nI also regret to report the death of Footpad Quyen, whose back went out in an untimely manner while fleeing from a Ra-Netu at the base of the Ninety-Nine Stairs. His surviving family will receive the usual stipend. \n\nWith the Utmost Esteem, \n\nOperative Maffud
By Warlock Aldaale\n\nMastering Conjuration means having access to an entire spectrum of utility. \n\n—Are you in need of a flame spell? Conjure a Flame Atronach. You'll have command of a dozen such spells, in the form of a fiery avatar. \n\n—Are you caught in the dead of night and wishing you had prepared a light spell? Conjure a Will-o-the-Wisp: its natural luminescence banishes darkness. \n\n—Do you lack a telekinesis spell to move a boulder out of your way? Conjure a Storm Atronach to lift it for you. \n\n—Did you forget the shield ward you'll need to protect yourself from a sudden hail? Conjure a Frost Atronach to crystallize the air above for temporary shelter. \n\n—Is your life detection spell unable to discern a fleeing target from all the other living things in the wilderness? Conjure a Wolf Familiar to pick up the scent. \n\nThe flexibility of Conjuration magic has been an unsung passion of mine, and I've compiled a comprehensive guide for replacing specific, commonly-used spells with Conjuration substitutions (see Volume II, page seven, for more).\n\nConjuration even allows access to Daedric abilities (for those who dare to wield them). A mage well-versed in Conjuration can summon all variety of Daedra, from Scamps to Dremora Lords. Mine wouldn't be the first primer for spells like these, but Volume III of this collection contains detailed instructions on beckoning the denizens of Oblivion. "The Origins of Conjuration" is also a useful read on the subject.*\n\nI realize I write highly of Conjuration here, almost extravagantly, but if you'll do me the favor of reading the rest of this collection (Volumes II-XXII), you'll find that my words have weight.\n\n*Author's Note: It should go without saying, but contact the Oblivion planes only with the utmost discretion: the unwary mage could lose her life—or worse—in dealings with the Daedra.
Volume 1\n\nBy Hilaire Beanique\n\nThe city of Wayrest owes much to its merchants for its ever-flourishing economy. The abundance of money has done the city wonders, earning Wayrest the moniker "Jewel of the Bay": the wealth of its citizens have paid for the shimmering stone used in the city's construction, the bright armor worn by the local law enforcement agents, and most significantly, the modern marvel of western Tamriel—the Wayrest Sewers.\n\nWritten accounts dating back to the city's foundation hint that, until the Wayrest Sewers were finished, the city was a jewel mired in muck and mud. Vile, foul-smelling mud. Writes Silvia Cato, an Imperial sailor in 1E 801, "The Bjoulsae River is a watercourse of refuse, of pungent tang, of disease, and the Iliac Bay is equally revolting where the Bjoulsae feeds into it. It's that damned Breton city."\n\nToday, the Bjoulsae River shines as brilliantly as Wayrest itself, thanks entirely to the sewers, which are a feat of engineering rivaling anything created by the Dwemer of old. The artisans ensured that the sewers' modular design permit travel across the city below ground as easily as above, as well as allow construction to continue to this day. The sewers, like the city itself, are regularly expanded. However, in its size lies the one drawback of the entire system: the sewers have become so large that Wayrest law enforcement has difficulty patrolling it all, and thus, crime finds its way even to the Jewel of the Bay. Like the city itself, most of these illicit activities can only be afforded by the rich, including skooma trade and necromancy (skooma is a narcotic that's widely banned across Tamriel, and necromancy, the magical art of raising the dead, is also forbidden in many regions).\n\nSee Volume II for a list of noble families that donated most heavily to the sewer construction. The original designers who imagined the sewers just prior to the fall of Orsinium remain lost to time, though Volume III contains a list of artisans and engineers who have worked to expand development since the end of the First Era.
A Handbook\nBy Wapna Neustra\nPraeceptor Emeritus\n\nFORM THE FIRST: Makest thou the Mana Fountain to be Primed with Pure Gold, for from Pure Gold only may the Humors be rectified, and the Pure Principles coaxed from the chaos of Pure Power. Droppest thou then the Pure Gold upon the surface of the Mana Fountain. Takest thou exceeding great care to safeguard yourself from the insalubrious tempests of the Mana Fountain, for through such Assaults may one's health be utterly Blighted.\n\nFORM THE SECOND: Make sure that thou havest with you this Excellent Manual, so that thou might speak the necessary Words straightaway, and without error, so that thou not in carelessness cause thyself and much else to discorporate and disorder the World with your component humors.\n\nFORM THE THIRD: Take in hand the item to be Restored, and hold it forth within the Primed Fountain, murmuring all the while the appropriate phrases, which are to be learned most expeditiously and faultlessly from this Manual, and this Manual alone, notwithstanding the vile calumnies of Kharneson and Rattor, whose bowels are consumed by envy of my great learning, and who do falsely give testament to the efficacies of their own Manuals, which are in every way inferior and steeped in error.\n\nFORM THE FOURTH: Proceed instantly to Heal thyself of all injuries, or to avail yourself of the Healing powers of the Temples and Healers, for though the agonies of manacaust must be borne by any who would Restore a prized Arcana to full Potency, yet it is not wise that suffering be endured unduly, nor does the suffering in any way render the Potency more Sublime, notwithstanding the foolish speculations of Kharneson and Rattor, whose faults and wickednesses are manifest even to the least learned of critics.
by Archivist Neleminduure\n\nBackground:\nHow this disease began and spread is a mystery. By gathering information, I hope to resolve the issue.\n\nArgonians appear immune to the flu. This has caused conjecture that they actually introduced the flu to retaliate for years of slavery at the hands of the Dark Elves. These claims have never been proven or disproven, and they require more research.\n\nMitigation:\nMethods that slowed the rapid spread of the flu included burning the belongings of infected people (which, unfortunately, sometimes including burning remaining family members); segregating the sick into ghettos (or walling them up); or putting the diseased onto ships and setting them adrift. Normal curative spells and elixirs were inconsistent in their ability to cure the flu. \n\nSymptoms and Course: \nGeneral malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue begins several hours before an afflicted victim develops other symptoms. The afflicted person's eyes water constantly. Skin develops a bright red granular rash that does not itch. \n\nWithin twenty-four to thirty-six hours, victims suffer nosebleeds, their tears contain blood, and a granular rash spreads over their bodies. At this point, victims develop a deep, raspy cough. Within thirty-six to forty-eight hours, the victims' coughs produce bloody phlegm. \n\nIn most cases, death takes place in as little as seventy-two hours after the initial onset, but some victims have lingered for five to seven days.\n\nTreatment: \nWhen the Knahaten Flu first spread, it seemed unstoppable. No reliable treatment against it has ever been proven.\n\nTen years ago, a young Redguard named Perizada claimed she'd had a vision from the Divines. She replicated the cure from this dream, testing it on a village scheduled to be razed (together with its inhabitants). Her cure worked, and the village was saved.\n\nThe cure required clannfear claws boiled in salt water. The patient would then drink the liquid. The increased trade of actual and purported clannfear claws on the black market caused prices to soar wildly. So many false cures had proven fatal that Perizada's cure was never officially sanctioned. As Perizada later died of the flu herself, its efficacy was eventually considered dubious at best.\n\nThe "Clannfear Cure" has given rise to many other supposed cures, all of which involve boiling something in a liquid and then drinking the result. For the poorest of the population, chicken broth proved not only cheap, but easily obtained. It typically soothed their coughs, which in turn allowed patients to breathe more easily. \n\nChicken broth is definitely not a guaranteed cure, but it is certainly the most accessible. It is recommended, should this dread disease ever return.\n\nAs the granular skin rash was non-irritating, many left it untreated. Those whose rash remained covered—whether in bandages, poultices, or simply clothing—seemed less likely to infect those who attended them. This also accounts for the much slower spread of the disease in colder climates and during winter months.\n\nHave you heard of other cures? If so, please submit your reports directly to me for further investigation.
By Thora Far-Wanderer\n\nNo pest has proven more resilient to the Nords of Skyrim than the common Orc. The tusked people claim occupancy of our fair realm, stretching back before the time Ysgramor crossed the Sea of Ghosts. Though few written accounts still exist of that time, there is mention in the histories of the Companions uprooting Orc strongholds even as they burned the Snow Elves from the land.\n\nOrc strongholds are well defended outposts often situated around deposits of mineral wealth. Each contains the infrastructure to support a dozen or more families, surrounded by walls designed to repel anything but the strongest martial force. Many jarls are remembered in song for dying vainly while attempting to root a stronghold from their lands. Worse, destroyed strongholds often return within a generation of their destruction if not countered by a Nord fort that needs a constant supply of troops and provisions. \n\nFew jarls can afford to defend piles of rock for more than a few years, and thus the Orc strongholds remain a pox upon our land. Some strongholds have persisted in this way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. It's said that the ancient Orc stronghold of Cradlecrush in Eastmarch has never been taken by force or abandoned, despite the complete exhaustion of the mineral vein it sits upon.\n\nThe height of Orcish power in Skyrim came with the establishment of Yashnag's Chiefdom in the early Second Era. With the destruction of Orsinium by the combined Breton and Redguard forces, the Orcs were scattered across the North in a great exodus. Yashnag and his people, exiled from High Rock, fled east to reclaim lands in Skyrim they felt were theirs by ancient right. The King of West Skyrim, Svartr, was ineffective in holding back the Orcs and the Reachmen that plagued the West Kingdom during his rule. The chiefdom was a bane upon Western Falkreath for more than thirty years, until it was burned out by Hakkvilld Yashnag-Slayer in the year 467 of the Second Era.\n\nHakkvild became Jarl of Falkreath when Yashnag killed his father on the field of battle. The young jarl inherited little more than a crumbling hold largely occupied by Orcish invaders from the west. It is said that Hakkvild challenged Yashnag and a host of Yashnag's Orc champions to a ritual trial by combat. He defeated each in turn. How Hakkvild learned of this obscure Orcish ritual is not known, but with their leader's defeat, Yashnag's followers abandoned the chiefdom.\n\nWith the destruction of the chiefdom, the Orcs scattered further into Skyrim or back into the mountains of Wrothgar. Orc clans descended from Yashnag's people have an intense hatred of the Kings of Skyrim. It's ironic that this enmity for the Nords has grown, even as the Orcs themselves have re-established ties with the peoples of western Tamriel that burned their first home hundreds of years ago.
Welcome to Shad Astula, the Academy of Magic! This is where the most talented mages of the Ebonheart Pact come to learn, share a common origin, and become leaders in the magical community. Your journey begins here.  \n\nFor many, the journey to master magic is fraught with frustration and difficulty. The training provided here can lead to a life of service and rewarding work, thanks to the availability of the best teachers and teaching methods. The fact of the matter is, while everyone invited to the Academy is selected for their potential for greatness, not all of you will measure up to the task before you. For those unfortunate enough to fail, Shad Astula serves as a safety net, a place to refine one's meager skills without causing harm to oneself or to others.\n\nBut you will not fail. You are not one of the unfortunates. You will rise above. You will take your place as a leader in the Ebonheart Pact!\n\nYou have already realized that you are different from others who can wield the gift of magicka. Now, prepare to be introduced to a world of power. For you, Shad Astula serves as a place where you can spread your wings. With the help of our staff of master mages, you will not only learn to fly, you will soar!\n\nAs one of the chosen of the Academy, the usual restrictions and rules that govern the learning of magic do not apply to you. Those rules exist to ensure the safety of mages who may pose a danger to themselves or to others. We anticipate that the Academy's select students will excel, and we believe you're capable of learning your limits quickly. A few guidelines do apply, however:\n\n     —Do not summon creatures from Oblivion planes, except within designated summoning circles.\n     —Magical experimentation on other Academy students is forbidden.\n     —Magical experimentation on non-Academy members is discouraged, but use your best judgment.\n     —Magical experimentation on staff is encouraged. Keep them on their guard, and they'll do the same for you.\n     —Designation of assistants as "minions" is strictly prohibited, and cultist or cabalist behaviors or organizations will be dealt with swiftly and harshly. Save your megalomania for after graduation.\n     —Students who have not passed the Emotional Control and Mental Stability Exam (ECMSE) are forbidden from sharing a room.\n     —Magical dueling is strictly prohibited, except under a staff Battlemage's supervision.\n\nYou will soon receive an appointment with the Headmaster, who will have more to say about Shad Astula and your status as a member of the Academy. In the meantime, feel free to explore the campus and introduce yourself to your fellow students. Some will become your peers, others your underlings, and a very select few your betters. Learn them well.\n\nWelcome to Shad Astula. Spread your wings and soar! We expect much of you. Do not disappoint us.
By Lord Gharesh-ri, Speaker for the Mane\n\nA wife. A husband. A son or daughter. Mother or father, aunt or uncle: each of us has lost one or more of these. It has touched every family in Elsweyr, the dreadful epidemic, the terrible plague—the Knahaten Flu.\n\nIt started in Senchal, on Sweet Street in the Black Kiergo slums, among the skooma-struck. At first the city elders dismissed it as a toxin in the goods, but then it spread to Dagi's Pride and Squint-Eye, and was reported from the docks in Alabaster as well. \n\nAnd suddenly, it was everywhere: Torval, Orcrest, Dune, Corinthe, and all points in between. The Winds of Khenarthi bore the coughing and retching to every ear. We seemed to be witnessing the Death of Cats on Nirn.\n\nSlowly, Elsweyr began to fight back against its doom. Clan Mother Mizaba-ko of Corinthe first identified how the flu spread from Khajiit to Khajiit. Rathuni-la Dawnwhisker, a Daughter of Azurah from Riverhold, distilled a sorghum-tea that mitigated the worst of the symptoms. Even I contributed, organizing the remnants of the Mane's Legion to maintain order and put this new knowledge to use. \n\nBut it was not enough. Everywhere, Khajiit were dying, by the litter, by the pride, by the entire tribe. The Moon-Bishops read the portents, and they were dire indeed.\n\nThen, past all expectation, help arrived from an unforeseen direction: over the western waves came the Elves of Summerset, bringing physicians, healers, desperately needed supplies.\n\nAnd one more thing: hope. Hope that Elsweyr would survive.\n\nAt first, many Cats were suspicious. Never before had the haughty High Elves helped the Khajiiti—why now? But their canonreeves passed among us, as if unafraid of the flu, and explained: the Altmer did it not from friendship, but from policy. We needed their help now, and they would need our help later. Invaders were coming to southwest Tamriel, they said, and the High Elves could not repulse them without Khajiiti claws at their side. \n\nTo fight against mutual enemies—ah, that was a logic we Cat-Folk could understand. So we accepted the aid of the High Elves, and their sly cousins the Wood Elves, and gradually the Knahaten Flu began to recede. And when Queen Ayrenn of Alinor proposed the alliance treaty of the Aldmeri Dominion, we took plume in claw and signed it. \n\nNow, fellow Khajiiti, we have been through the forges of torment, and with our new allies, we emerge stronger than ever. We welcome the chance to test blade and edge against these invaders, to spill their blood and take their bright objects.\n\nFor now is the time of the Dominion.
The following are notes gathered, over the past centuries, of items of unimaginable significance. All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout Tamriel. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n\nSkull Crusher\n\nThe Skull Crusher is an amazingly large and powerful weapon. This warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.\n\nSpear of Bitter Mercy\n\nOne of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin.\n\nSpell Breaker\n\nSpell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magics or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.\n\nStaff of Hasedoki\n\nHasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.\n\nStaff of Magnus\n\nThe Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.\n\nUmbra Sword\n\nThe Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.\n\nVampiric Ring\n\nOne of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.\n\nWarlock's Ring\n\nThe Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command.
BUOYANT ARMIGER STYLE\n\nBy Lord Vivec\n\nVivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order. "You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers," he said.\n\nBELTS\n\n"A scavenger cannot acquire a silk sash and expect to discover the greater systems of its predecessor: perfect happiness is embraced only by the weeping." And the belt of the tassets and the arms of the Armiger shall be fore and aft a chevron, and descend in the places of generation.
By Sannemmu Khamishi, Wise Woman of the Erabenimsun Tribe\n\nSo, Clanfriend, you are curious about our clothing? You wonder how such simple, nomadic barbarians can come to have such elaborate and sophisticated garments and tools? Then learn this: for the Ashlander, simplicity is a choice, not a necessity. We follow the precepts of the Good Daedra, and our practices and preferences are in accord with their teachings. We have other, deeper secrets which I will not reveal now, but the making of our apparel and arms are not among them. \n\nHELMETS\n\nOur hoods and helms cover the entire head, for safety in the harsh environment of the Ashlands, particularly when Red Mountain's mood is ugly. A mask or filtered visor keeps ash from nose and mouth, and goggles protect the eyes from soot, embers, and fume. The skull is protected by overlapping bands of rigid chitin, sometimes knobbed or crested.
By Vorar Vendu, One-Time Camonna Tong\n\nYou probably heard of the Camonna Tong. It's the name whispered in dark alleys as blood pools on the cobblestones, the signature on the ransom note left on a neighbor's bed. A shadow, a curse, a boil upon the arse of our society. And, though I'm not proud to admit it, it's a part of my past.\n\nNow, I'm not writing this for those of you already on the right side of the law. I'm writing this for the ones who have already ventured off that moral path, those that walk the thin line between wrong and right. The ones with empty bellies and emptier coffers, who might see the Camonna Tong as a viable option. To you I say, keep reading.\n\nSure, the Camonna Tong has stability. A steady stream of income is a hard thing to turn down, and they've got structure to boot. They'll lure you in with the possibility of glory, of command, of rising through the ranks. And sure, what they do is far from legal. But if you're already leaning in that direction, wouldn't you rather be in good company?\n\nIt didn't take much sweet talking before I signed right up, and at first life was good. Extorting the rich flat-heads who had lorded above me all my life? My pleasure! A few robberies, a few break-ins? Nothing I wasn't use to. And sure, we talked big about driving away the outlanders, of taking Vvardenfell back for the Dark Elves. But I'll be honest, nothing made me question what I was doing.\n\nNothing, that is, until some Argonian seamstress got a little uppity. \n\nOh, it was the talk of the town. Some scaled n'wah had the gall to start up her own shop—and be successful with it to boot! She was taking away good business from Dark Elves, that's what she was doing. Taking away gold from our mothers and sisters. So we did what the Camonna Tong does best. We made her pay. \n\nThe kidnapping was easy. Yeah, her shop was doing well, but she was still an Argonian. I don't think we saw a single guard as we slipped into her house, not in that part of town. We tied her up and gagged her before she had a chance to cry for help, laughing like it was some big joke. Young hotheads who had too much to drink. I thought we were just going to scare her, set her straight, make her realize that she couldn't think herself better.\n\nI started to sober up when the beatings began. First a slap to her face, but that quickly turned to punches and kicks. They joked about how she could take it, how Argonian skin was so thick no one would even see the bruises. I can still hear her muffled cries along with their laughter. \n\nI just watched as the beatings became more intense, as blood started dribbling from her gagged mouth. I wasn't a stranger to violence, or truly opposed to it given my line of work. But there was something about tying up this old Argonian and beating her bloody, kicking her as she fell to the floor. My throat grew tight as I watched, motionless. No one seemed to notice my lack of enthusiasm, so enraptured in the righteous justice they gladly doled out. \n\nSomeone pulled out a dagger and made the casual remark, " You know, it's pretty hard to sew without fingers." \n\nSuddenly I was wide awake.\n\nI wish I could tell you that I stopped them. Said something clever, did something brave. But the truth is I walked out. I left that room, that town, that life. Not with my head held high, but broken, defeated, thinking of that poor Argonian's eyes, filled with terror. So different from my own, yet so alike. I don't know if they went through with it, if there's a fingerless beggar somewhere who sees my face in her nightmares. I don't think I'll ever try to find out.\n\nSo next time you think of the Camonna Tong, of the glamor and the gold? You think of how easy it is for your crooked morals to slip away entirely. How big talk and some drink can lead you down a darker path than you ever realized you were capable of. How easy it is to say nothing, and how much easier to just join along.
This month's Tribunal Temple Profile shines a bright light on our own high priest in the service of Lord Vivec—Archcanon Tarvus! Yours truly, Seventy-sixth Adjuvant Drumara, sat down to interview the busy cleric in his well-appointed office in the Hall of Wisdom, in the canton directly across from Vivec's Palace in Vivec City.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Archcanon. The faithful who regularly read our weekly missives have been asking to learn more about the Dunmer who keeps the Temple and the city running smoothly.\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Lord Vivec and the Tribunal keep the wheels turning. I am merely their servant.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Modest, as always! How did you find your way to a life of religious service?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: I grew up in House Indoril, so while a role in the Temple wasn't guaranteed, it was certainly strongly encouraged. I found that the words of the Warrior-Poet moved me, and I quickly gravitated toward serving Lord Vivec. Here's a secret few people know—I almost dedicated myself to the Buoyant Armigers. The call to adventure appealed to my younger self, and I even fancied myself something of a poet. Lord Vivec, however, had other plans for me.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: So it's true that Lord Vivec himself recruited you into his priesthood?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Let's not make the story more significant than the reality. I was a young acolyte, training for a life of service in the Temple. When the time came to choose a path, Lord Vivec talked to me and suggested I would do better in the priesthood than as a swashbuckling Armiger or a militaristic Ordinator. I meditated on my choice and discovered, deep in my heart, that I agreed with him.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: And then you demonstrated a real talent for both spiritual and administrative labors, rising to become the youngest canon ever to attain the rank of archcanon?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Young? I suppose so. But that was so long ago. I worked hard, constantly demonstrating my devotion to Vivec, the Three, and the people of Morrowind. That Lord Vivec saw fit to reward me with this honor and this responsibility, well, you'd have to ask him why I of all the canons was ultimately selected to replace my predecessor. I am just grateful for the opportunity to help my Lord and serve my Temple.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Your sermons on the dangers of outlanders in Vvardenfell can be quite stirring. Do you think our land really faces a threat from those who come with different cultures and beliefs?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: For a minor priest and functionary, you tend to ask leading questions. My views on outlanders, however, are quite well known and completely consistent. No one other than the Dark Elves can claim such a unique relationship as we have with our Living Gods. That gives us a perspective and outlook on life that is, in fact, superior to every other culture in Tamriel. We are stronger when we are pure, when our culture isn't polluted by the thoughts and ideas of the lesser peoples. But other than that, I have nothing against the occasional outlander visiting our fair and beautiful island of Vvardenfell. "To challenge the strange allows us to know our strength," as the Warrior-Poet has written.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: One of your closest aides, Canon Llevule Andrano, has been quoted as saying that you "carry the burden of Lord Vivec and the entire palace atop your shoulders." Do you agree with his assessment?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Is it a burden to serve the Warrior-Poet? Is it an obligation to make sure the business of the palace and the Temple and the city progresses smoothly and without stumble? I do what I do for my love of the Tribunal and its people. That is not a burden, Adjuvant Drumara, that is a rare and singular privilege! I do my best to instill that same attitude in all of the priests that serve under my administration. You would do well to remember that, as I am quite certain you fit into that category.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Of course, Archcanon Tarvus. I simply asked so that I could quote you accurately. May I ask one more question before we conclude this interview?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: If you must.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: How is the work on Vivec City coming along?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Construction on Lord Vivec's metropolis proceeds just as the Warrior-Poet has commanded. The cantons take shape like islands in the bay. The ziggurats rise as though to touch Baar Dau itself. It is already a masterpiece, and it is not yet nearly half done! Vivec City is already the envy of every other nation in Tamriel. Imagine the accolades we shall receive as it nears completion! Now, if we're done here, I have the business of Lord Vivec to get back to.
All factotums possess basic excavation capabilities, but the Imperfect surpasses all others in terms of sheer power. Unfortunately, Imperfect excavations require a huge output of energy. Unlike lesser factotums, this automata requires a fully charged animo core to function.\n\nOrder of operations for charging animo cores:\n\n1. Ensure that an inert, empty animo core is firmly locked into the distillate filling station bracket.\n2. Ensure that all flow valves are set to the correct throughput position.\n3. Push the geodic distillate flow-lever into the "Fill" position.\n4. Allow core to charge fully, then unlock the filling station bracket and remove the core.\n\nNote:\n\nIncorrectly positioned flow valves can disrupt the geodic distillate distribution system. Activate the emergency reset valve if flow position reaches critical instability. All flow valves will return to their original position.
Warning: Reactions with Clockwork City soil may radically change a mushroom strain's expected properties. Only imbibe fungi after extensive testing using fabricant subjects. As the saying goes, you can eat all mushrooms, but some only once.\n\nStrain A-01-K: Large, flat caps, red. One stalk in cluster always white. Subject exhibited difficulty keeping balance after eating sample. Three gear clicks later, subject charged in unpredictable directions, often losing its balance while doing so. This resulted in a short delay in experimentation as factotums repaired damage to nearby equipment.\n\nStrain B-01-T: Medium-sized, puffy caps, white with blood-red spots. Subject ate sample rapidly, then proceeded to the next. Factotums had to react quickly to prevent subject from eating the entire batch.\n\nStrain C-02-K: Large white pods with black spots, grows in two- and three-pod clusters. Tested a two-pod cluster. Subject grew sick and died shortly after ingestion. Spore pods then grew on subject and burst when handled. Evacuated lab until factotums eradicated all spores. Note: Work out containment procedures before testing three-pod cluster.\n\nStrain D-01-K: Large, round slimy caps, mottled yellow and white. Subject started uncontrollably shivering after eating sample. Attempts by factotums to provide warmth failed. As subject was no longer of experimental use, it was disposed of.\n\nStrain E-02-K: Large to huge, drooping caps, gray. Subject's first attempt to consume a fully mature specimen resulted in the loss of several teeth and a minor stress fracture to the lower mandibular enhancement. Factotums coaxed subject to make a second attempt with an immature, smaller specimen. Subject extracted and ate the warts on the stalk with no ill effect. Note: Attempt to create weapons and armor out of mature stalks.\n\nStrain F-03-T: Medium-sized, wavy caps set in tiers, orange with white rim. Subject immediately evacuated contents of stomach onto the floor. Sent a sample to Idrono for analysis. Note: Reformulate factotums to ignore stains on floor. They become too obsessed maintaining sanitary conditions.\n\nStrain G-02-K: Large, bowl-shaped caps, mottled tan and orange with white-purple stalk. Subject devoured the sample and did not exhibit signs of hunger for two days after ingestion. Note: Conduct further experiments on the nutritional effects of this strain to determine cost effectiveness, as it is particularly labor-intensive to cultivate.

By Rosalind Frenrick, Stranded Mage\n\nSo I've been told that my observations have been too … colorful? I suppose is the way I'd put it. I guess after growing up in a world that's just different shades of brown, a bit of color can be confusing. Still, they told me to write my observations, and I'll be damned if I can do that any way but how I know how. So they'll just have to "analyze" a bit harder.\n\nI thought I'd write about other places in Clockwork City that I've visited so far. I've talked about the Brass Fortress and the general Radius, but there are some other locations around here that I've been taken to. Some of them seemed a tad more practical than others, but then again, I'm not really sure I can compare my definition of practical with the God of Mystery's.\n\nFirst they took me to the Mnemonic Planisphere. Well, more like we walked by it, because I wasn't allowed to go inside. I was told it was sort of like a storehouse for Sotha Sil's memories. Yeah, you read right. His memories! He's apparently got so many of them that he likes to keep them all organized in a giant building. I tell you, it's almost as big as a castle. And they look like stars? How you turn memories into stars, I'm not sure, but then again I'm not a god.\n\nThe next stop was far more practical of a place, called the Halls of Regulation. Now, I had been wondering where all the fresh water came from, because the rivers and lakes here are filled with oil of all things! Apparently this place somehow cleans it all up. Sure, they tried to explain it to me. Talked about the water cycle and evaporation and all these fancy terms. But hey, it gives me fresh water, so I can't complain even if I barely understand it.\n\nThe inside was a bit less spruced up than I expected. A lot of pipes, a lot of steam, and a lot of factotums. Couldn't help but feel nervous around them all. I was told that they help maintain the Halls of Regulation, all by themselves. I was shocked, since the whole operation sounded a bit high maintenance. Wasn't there an apostle there to give them orders and make sure everything was running smoothly? And then they started talking about Sotha Sil and how he sets everything in "perfect regulation" and honestly I started to lose track of the conversation from then on.\n\nWe then went up north to the Everwound Wellspring, which was my favorite stop because they had actual food there! I've never been more happy to eat an apple in my life. After weeks of tasteless gruel, it was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Ma was right, hunger is truly the best seasoning. And all the plants were green! I never thought I'd miss green as much as I do.\n\nDespite my excitement though, I couldn't help but feel that something was off about the place. The mer running it was nice enough, but after talking to him I could tell he had a few screws loose. All that stress really must have really gotten to him. I suppose he's under a lot of pressure though, especially since he took up the project after Sotha Sil got bored of it. \n \nWell, they're telling me to complete this observation report best I can now. I don't think they need any more observations from me, so I guess this is it. Right, so my overall impression is that Clockwork City … well, it's one of the most dangerous places I've ever set foot in. I can't really believe someone who calls himself a god would really let his followers live here. It's more made for machines than any living creature.\n\nStill, it has an odd beauty about it. The metal leaves in the trees that glitter in the sun are particularly nice. Guess I'll just have to get use to it, since this seems to be a one way trip. No one but Sotha Sil gets to leave Clockwork City. Honestly, I hope I'm the last beef-wit who gets stuck here. I wouldn't wish this life on anyone else.
To the alienist, the ability—or inability—of a living mind to cope with stimuli and deprivation is of the utmost interest. How is it that some minds endure when others fail? What manifests in the aftermath of those outcomes? How can those manifestations be identified and altered? The workings of our own minds are as much a mystery as the workings of the material world, and it is no less dangerous to neglect their care than it is to mistreat the corporeal self.\n\nWhile Clockwork City is a facsimile of Nirn in many ways, it is not a duplication. Many of the rules that govern the world simply do not apply to this realm, and things often taken for granted in the terrestrial world are found to be of vital importance to an individual's sanity when they are suddenly found scarce. Here I will outline a number of the most common afflictions to develop in previously well-adjusted individuals now inhabiting the Clockwork City.\n\nCyclical Inert Ingestion — Compulsive craving and ingestion of non-nutritious and sometimes harmful materials. It is not unusual for inhabitants and visitors in Clockwork City to experience a palate fatigue for the nutriment paste produced within the Brass Fortress, despite its inoffensive taste and complete nutritional profile. This often causes these individuals to experiment with consuming unusual substances for relief from that fatigue or because of a fallacious belief about the benefits of ingesting the substance that they have developed a taste for. In many cases this condition may safely go untreated, though some individuals' compulsions pose a significant danger to their health and those patients should be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for a more controlled therapeutic environment.\n\nMagnusomnic Melancholy — Connections between mortal beings and the stellar bodies are well established, though fraught with superstition and apocrypha. Our relationship with the sun is of particular relevance to the psyche. From simple moodiness and doldrums in the long nights of winter to the violent, frenzied aversion of victims of vampirism, exposure to the sun has a noticeable effect on the mental health of many races, so its complete absence from Clockwork City is trying on most individuals. Lethargy, irregular sleep patterns, dark thoughts or impulses, and a general malaise are all signs that your patient could be suffering from solar deprivation. See volumes on treatment regarding variations of light conjuration and simulated sunlight.\n\nEncapsulation Syndrome — A particularly insidious affliction similar to the acute fear of being trapped commonly observed in the terrestrial world. Individuals used to living their lives under the open sky are sometimes disconcerted by the easily demarcated boundaries of Sotha Sil's heavens. They begin to feel an inescapable sense of confinement that creates ever-present feelings of anxiety and agitation. These mounting pressures will push them to breaking point if left unresolved and should be considered a priority for treatment.\n\nMinisculation Terrors — The terrors can be defined as bouts of irrational panic and paranoia that the victims are shrinking. It is unclear whether these episodes are a side effect of transitioning into this realm, or a pathological reaction to the experience of being miniaturized. Patients tend to describe peculiarities in their perception, ranging from a vague sense of things just being a little off, to vertigo, to delusional claims of evidence. For example, one such patient cited that they were now unable to reach an object they had placed on a high shelf the day before. Often these claims are a result of misremembered details, such as forgetting that they were wearing thick heeled shoes, though there is at least one recorded case of legitimate uncontrolled shrinking, so be diligent in investigating these claims.\n\nObsessive Focus and Fixation — Particularly common among apostles. Sometimes our colleagues must be saved from themselves. Clockwork City was designed with freedom from distraction in mind. It is a place of contemplation and learning, and sometimes the example Lord Sotha Sil sets is adhered to too closely by his followers. We are not gods. We cannot withdraw into our studies indefinitely and tirelessly without consequence. It may be necessary to intervene in the studies of an apostle who has developed an unhealthy obsession with their research. Fixated patients have been known to neglect sleep, forget to eat, shun all contact with others, and in some cases literally work themselves to death. As such, we are granted the authority to remand such cases to Asylum Sanctorium at our discretion. \n\nCorporeal Odium — Self-loathing, specifically of one's physical form. Outside of Clockwork City it was primarily observed in kingdoms where one's physical features or biological heritage play a significant role in an individual's societal worth. It is also a fairly common trait among possessing spirits. This condition is on the rise among Clockwork Apostles who believe their enhancements represent an ideal that their native flesh fails to live up to. Reckless augmentation, self-mutilation, and emotional volatility are all warning signs that an apostle's desire for alteration has become an unhealthy obsession and the patient should likely be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for psycho-spiritual realignment.
By Artificer Dalomar\n\nSo, you say you want to craft arms and armor in the Clockwork Apostle style? Well, don't just stand there spinning your gears! Tune your mnemonics to what I've got to say, and follow every diagram, schematic, and sequence-plaque to the letter. We'll get all your cogs and cams whirring in sync in no time. No time at all! Let's begin!\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nWhat heroic proctor's silhouette would be complete without ornate pauldrons? Like the Father of Mysteries himself, the Clockwork Apostles adorn themselves with beautifully engraved shoulder armor. The hollows ensure it is both light and flexible, and the reinforced brass makes them nearly indestructible.
By Gherig Bullblood of the Dreadhorn Clan [Notes by Rena Hammerhands]\n\nWayward sons and daughters, set aside your old ways and embrace the Hunt-Father's terrible champion Domihaus! Henceforth, his ways shall be our ways!

Date: 31 Last Seed, 1E 2750 (?)\n\nI'm not sure why I'm writing this. I kept this journal for Marius's benefit, but he's gone now. Twenty years gone. Time supposedly makes things easier—dulls the pain. But my grief is deeper now than it's ever been.\n\nBusyness. Order. These things help. I threw myself into my work—marshaling the apostles into a stronger, leaner, more effective order. I cracked down on crime, published a treatise on Marius's alchemical experiments, focused on my spellcraft; but none of these accomplishments come close to filling gaping hole my son left behind.\n\nI never told anyone what took place in the Cogitum all those years ago. People are rightly afraid to broach the topic. Even now, twenty years later, my anger glows white-hot.\n\nBetrayal—that's the only word I can think of. I forded through the Centralis as quickly as I could, destroying any hostile factotum, fabricant, and mechanical trap that stood between me and Lord Seht. When I reached the Throne Aligned, I found Sotha Sil sitting on the stairs leading to his seat of power. He didn't even look up.\n\n"I know why you're here," he said.\n\nI was so naive then, I smiled and rushed toward him like a child. "Good!" I cried. "We have to move quickly. Marius is near to passing."\n\nBut Sotha Sil didn't stand up. He didn't even look me in the eye. "I am sorry," he said. "I cannot give you what you seek."\n\nI stumbled over my words, trying to understand what he was saying. I just repeated myself like an idiot, thinking perhaps that he hadn't heard me. "Marius is dying. We have to get back to him as soon as possible!"\n\nHe stood up and pursed his lips before speaking. "I'm sorry," was his only reply.\n\nWe stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, I shook my head and whispered, "I don't understand. My body was ruined and you healed me. It's only Marius's heart that needs mending."\n\nSeht approached, placed a brass hand on my shoulder and said, "You misunderstand. It is within my power to heal Marius, but circumstances make it impossible. I grieve with you, Luciana."\n\nI looked up and there were tears in his eyes. I felt a great rage rise up within me. I reached for my hammer, and lifted it above my head just before Seht whispered a banishing word and sent me hurtling back toward the surface.\n\nMarius died two days later. Sotha Sil remains in the Cogitum Centralis to this day.\n\nThe other apostles offered the same trite consolations I used to give to the grieving parents of men who died under my command in the Imperial Legion. "It was his time." "He lived a good and honorable life." On and on. But in my heart, I will never forgive Sotha Sil. Never. I will remain a proctor of the apostles. I will always safeguard the city I love, and uphold the laws and traditions of the order. But my adoration for the Clockwork God has shriveled and starved.\n\nThis is my final entry. For any who choose to read this journal, know only this: Sotha Sil gives and takes without consultation or mercy. Do not mistake his interest for empathy. Do not mistake assistance for authentic acts of kindness. Some are saved, others are sacrificed. That's just the way of things in the Clockwork City.
Notes of Clockwork Apostle Ralam Falen \nExcerpts Transcribed by Relicmaster Glenadir\n\nLog 32\n\nSubject 15A shows increasing signs of agitation. I suspect he may have discovered the experiments perimeters, though to what extent I'm unsure. Still unsure how this may impact current testing.\n\nSubject 15B has begun to lapse sentences together, though this may only be true from an outsider perspective. She most likely is speaking in complete sentences from her own worldview. Her temperament remains the most positive, but given that she has only perceived her capture to be two days I can only think that would be the case.\n\nSubject 15C has begun to go into a catatonic state. He reacts little to the other test subjects, and has begun long fits of sobbing. I fear he may no longer be viable for testing. By my calculations, he will have perceived his capture as being over five years at this point.
By Telenger the Artificer\n\nAre languages in Tamriel more than a convenient means of communication? Throughout my studies, particularly in my ongoing research of the mysterious runestones, a theme of language explicitly interconnected with magic has surfaced with frequency that cannot be ignored. Is the very act of casting ideas into words an invocation? I present here evidence that may just support this admittedly radical position, which I hope the Sapiarchs of the Crystal Tower will be enticed to expound upon or refute.\n\nLet us begin with the runestones of Enchanting. Each is marked with a symbol consisting of syllables arranged together. Alone, a rune is inert, but magical potential is unleashed when combined with others in the appropriate syntax. The full form, the complete expression, conveys magic. One does not even need to fully understand the language to unlock the power it contains—not enough words exist or are known to truly speak it, but by studying glyphs and combining runestones, it is possible to grasp enough of the raw concepts to utilize it. The language itself is undeniably connected in a fundamental way to magical energies, though its origin remains a mystery.\n\nAs an aside for prospective students of Enchanting, do not become discouraged when you encounter a rune you are unable to decipher. Only through repetition of words and phrases you have learned and the extraction of runes from glyphs will you obtain the knowledge you need to master more difficult runes. Be patient and work with other students to create and deconstruct glyphs to gain more insight into their interplay and true meaning.\n\nLanguage, specifically the written word, is also of critical importance to the Altmer. Not only does it preserve our history, but it captures and defines our auspicious lineage and ensures that every Mer knows his or her place in the hierarchy. It is no accident that Altmeri society is the most orderly and structured in Tamriel—it is the will of Xarxes himself. The scholar-priests of the divine scribe, secretive though they are, are said to preserve an ancient tongue long forgotten to any but their order. In Helaameril's "Conversations with the Etymon-Binders," an anonymous scribe hints at tomes capable of producing tastes, smells, dancing images, and texts that can be read by any gazing upon them—even the unlettered. Another form of word-magic, if Helaameril is to be believed.\n\nConsider even what may seem mundane: the speech of a great general upon the morn of battle that rouses his troops to perform incredible deeds, the songs of a master bard that inspire emotion, the calming tone of a mother to her child. Are there traces of magic in everyday exertions of will through speech or writing? It seems possible that some remnant of ancient pre-Dawn power lingers on here, though it has grown faint. There is even more evidence to support this throughout the history of Tamriel—far too much to detail here—and I look forward to debating this theory among my peers.
Chapter Forty-Seven: Altmeric Rites of Martial Contest\n\nDespite our majestic Aedric heritage, we Altmer are not immune to the mundane, worldly tensions that plague the affairs of lesser races. Wisdom and prudence dictate that simple disagreements are best settled through dialogue. Long and thorough consideration, combined with wine and fellowship often yield reconciliation in short order. Alas, some indignities cut so deeply that an honorable martial contest is the only route to rapprochement. In such cases, the aggrieved parties must abide by the following rules.\n\n1. Both parties must arm themselves with a traditional Altmer dueling foil. long swords, axes, flails and the like are not permitted by the sacred laws of Trinimac. Foils must be washed in mineral water, thoroughly dried, and well-polished.\n\n2. Prior to the duel, both parties must recite their adversary's full name—taking care to call upon matrilineal, patrilineal, and clan honorifics where appropriate. Duelists who stumble over or mispronounce their adversary's name must stop and recite the name in its totality twice more.\n\n3. Duelists must ensure that a second is present for the duel. These witnesses are honor-bound to intervene should one of the aggrieved parties commit an honor-infraction such as casting dirt in their opponent's eyes, fleeing the field prior to the duel's conclusion, or using venomous words that might further inflame tensions between parties.\n\nThe victorious duelist must engage with their defeated opponent in a courteous and humble fashion—availing them of family physicians, bandages, or any other appropriate service to dress their wounds. Defeated duelists are likewise required to admit error, and humbly request forgiveness for their actions. If the parties follow these rules, both emerge from the conflict with honor intact. And this is good, for nothing on Nirn counts more than honor.
What a delight this temple has turned out to be. Yes, these colder conditions are positively wondrous for my mixtures. And there's no nasty guards to question us. No eyes that look upon our blessing with ignorant distaste. Many questioned my decision, but oh, they simply saw what was ahead. Not beyond, not as I do.\n\nMy research with the ogres in the caverns has produced … admittedly mixed results. They were easy enough to infect. Predictable patterns and slow wits make for lovely test subjects. We saw early signs of the physical manifestations of the disease, yes, oh yes. Lovely, absolutely lovely. These disgusting creatures became beautiful under my guidance. Oh, how lucky they were, to be the first embraced by such a loving illness.\n\nBut then it turned all wrong! They turned out all wrong, all wrong! The way they've begun to act, you wouldn't even think they were sick. Nasty, stupid creatures won't even die! They just became … angry. Stronger. Downright mean! They started attacking my researchers. I'm afraid we lost quite a few just last night. Hopefully we can still remain on schedule, but I can see quite a delay already.\n\nThough it pains me to leave such research behind, I simply must conclude that these ogres are too beast like. We'll need more human subjects if we wish to continue our research. We simply have no time for our usual procedures, given how isolated this mountain is. Many have proposed the giants may prove to be useful. Dangerous, dangerous, but what is discovery without a few deaths?\n\nOn a personal note, my other ear has finally rotted off. There's still a bit more to go, but the current state shows promise. Everyday I become more beautiful, more perfect. More blessed.
I'm simply atwitter with excitement at our latest developments. Our lovely plague has come together nicely, so nicely. Yes, I dare say at this point it's nigh incurable! We had some initial troubles with creating a delay in symptoms. Burn out the subject too quickly, and, well, there's no time for it to spread. No, we want to keep them up and about, spreading our blessing to as many as possible. How … reverent.\n\nAnd when the symptoms do come, oh, well—it goes beyond description. I could wax poetic about the succulent pus, those all-spreading rashes. Boils, nearly translucent, they become so overfilled. The mere sight of that lovely, sickening shade of green sends pleasant shivers throughout my body. Have you ever seen something so beautiful? I've always had pride in my work, but this borders on adoration.\n\nThe giants have proved useful, just as the ogres, but still their reaction is just … wrong! They've turned my poor creation into something different, something unexpected. The heathens! Just like the ogres, it's turned them stronger, even more aggressive. They simply aren't human enough. Not right! The majority of them should be dead by now, but here they are, sturdier than ever. It makes me sick, and not in the good way!\n\nWe've lost a handful of researchers already, and I simply can't afford to lose more. The giant's matriarch has become particularly aggressive. And she just started to look so lovely, too. What a shame. I had hoped to sketch her in my spare time. Well, the path to discovery always tends to be tricky terrain. A few deaths are just unavoidable if we ever hope to reach our goal.\n\nSpeaking of our goal … oh, yes, yes, yes! She's begun to wake up. I feel it in my bones. Such a sleepy head, that one is. I hear her though. Oh, I hear her! She whispers to me of our glorious plans, how we will usher in a new age. I know we will. We must keep her safe, for the time being. And then she will become the shepherd.\n\nI'm hoping to look my best when we finally meet. My nose has begun to rot, but the progress is slow. I'm half tempted to chop it off myself! But no. No, no, it would just look all wrong. I must be patient, in all things. My blessed beauty will come in time.
My dear Aldarch Tilcalar,\n\nI am so glad you suggested transferring to our beloved monastery. I was happy to use my influence to make that happen. Especially after that insightful discussion we had concerning Queen Ayrenn's radical and frankly dangerous decree. I look forward to working with you to make sure Shimmerene, and indeed all of Summerset, remains safe and secure.\n\nYour plan to sequester newcomers in order to test their suitability for residency in Shimmerene is a stroke of genius. Determining who has the ability and temperament to become productive members of our society and who does not will allow us to spot troublemakers and lackadaisical transients before any damage is done. It isn't a perfect solution, but it will suffice until we can urge the Unforeseen Queen to rescind this order and send all the nebarra—the unwelcome—back to where they came from. \n\nSend me a list of candidates you deem acceptable for life in Summerset. I'm sure Proxy Queen Alwinarwe will appreciate having documentation concerning whom we permitted to stay and whom we sent away. I keep saying that Summerset is sacrosanct. Let Auridon deal with the other races. After all, our "beloved" Queen spends all her time there anyway, carousing with cats and Wood Elves. I'm sure she'd love more company.\n\nKinlady Avinisse

Puhnara,\n\nI'm sorry. We should have never come down here. We should have heeded the curse. The things down here, they look like Elves, but they're more like beasts. They leapt on us in the dark. Dragged us to some crypt. To their leader. He was almost like a normal person, until he opened his mouth. To hear him talk about the sinkholes, you'd think it was the end of the world. He kept saying he couldn't fail the Saviors, but we would help repay their kindness.\n\nThey had the others there. Still alive, but pale. They had incisions that were barely healed. I managed to unlock our cage, like you showed me, but the others were too weak. I promised we'd come back for them, but I have no idea where I am. Tunnels lead to homes, which lead to streets, which lead to more tunnels. I'm cornered now and I can hear them coming.\n\nIf you find me. Run. Choke these tunnels with the sea and never return. Whatever was buried here should have stayed that way.\n\nKarnhar

By Unknown\n\nMy research has led me to seek out Ebon Stadmont, a forest of much rumor and speculation, but little known fact. Specifically, my curiosity lies within the mysterious language found throughout the forest, inscriptions etched within decayed ruins. This language is unknown, unstudied, and largely unquestioned. I suspect this has much to do with the hazards the forest possesses, rather than an inability to properly research said language.\n\nThe forest twists, in a way. Moves as you walk through it. You'll see your destination, just over the foliage. Walk through one of the many archways, only to find yourself in a completely new location than the one you set out. It's some sort of teleportation magic at work, I suspect, though so seamless one can hardly notice as it happens. \n\nThe foliage is dense, bringing to mind a hedge maze more than a proper woods. It's obvious that someone, or something, designed this forest to be sectioned off. For the explicit purpose, I believe, of keeping outsiders out. What connection these protective measures have with the language I plan to study, I'm unsure. But perhaps, through my research, I can discover the answer.\n\n* * *\nMy initial findings within Ebon Stadmont have been, as I've feared, inconclusive. I had once believed the language to be similar in form to Daedric, but all experimentation to that end have yielded no results. Though this language may be similarly ancient, I do not believe it to have Daedric origins. And so, I fear that I begin my studies from the ground up.\n\nThe one blessing within this expedition has come from what I expected to be our biggest stumbling block; the forest itself. Have the rumors been exaggerated? All of our incidents with the forest's twisting nature have been both few in number and minor inconveniences, at best. I've lost none of my troupe, as I once feared I may, though I've ordered them to stick close together.\n\nI feel a sense of acceptance. As if the forest has judged us worthy of uncovering its mysteries. Or perhaps the magical protections here have waned over time. Whatever the case, I don't plan to allow this good fortune to go to waste. Set backs are no, I am determined to research this language.\n\n* * *\nFinally, the mysteries of this language begin to unfold. I was looking at it all wrong, that was my problem. I only saw a language, consisting of mere symbols. Something to be researched and translated. But these words have power. I see that now.\n\nWithin these inscriptions contain an untapped source of magical energy. But, try as I may, I cannot find a way to release it. To use it, the way I feel it so deeply wishes to be used. The kind of creative energy, full of an untold potential. But of what?\n\nThe words are alive. They speak to me sometimes, if I listen close. Words whispered in my mind. The power that has laid dormant for so long, willing itself back into existence. If only I could discover how.
By Siege-Master Germia Demetrius\n\nDuring The Reman Dynasty's wars of expansion, the Imperial Legion mounted countless sieges on fortresses both great and small. In most cases, merciless bombardment prompted a swift surrender. The Imperials' mastery of digging and siege works combined with the Akaviri's fire wizardry and alchemical prowess seemed unstoppable. Even so, some foes fancied themselves the Empire's equals. The false-god of the Dark Elves, Vivec the Liar, was such a foe.\n\nOver the course of several months, Reman II's legions drove the Dark Elves back deep into their own territory. At length, the Elves dug in at the venerable fortress of Ald Marak. It was an imposing fortress to be sure, with high, sturdy walls, and deep-water approaches that made assaults on foot nearly impossible.\nThe sons and daughters of the Tribunal faith consolidated their forces behind those walls, content to wait for their god's arrival. But Vivec did not arrive. On the advice of a foolish spy, he took a defensive position elsewhere, in the shadow of Ald Iuval. Too far away to intervene when the dark hour came.\n\nThe Imperials knew well the power of faith and fanaticism. Engaging the armies of Morrowind with their god at their back was a fool's gambit. Rather than settle in for a protracted siege, the Imperials concocted a bold plan. Under cover of nightfall, their mystics weaved great spells of water-breathing. Thus ensorcelled, the heavily armored legion marched into Lake Coronati. At length, they emerged from the water like vengeful ghosts, thundered through the lightly guarded gates, and burned the fort like a bundle of dry kindling. \n\nSo you see, creativity and daring can win a siege as surely as any ram or trebuchet. Develop a fox's cunning, soldier. It will serve you well.
By Loremaster Celarus\n\nThe Psijic Order eschews combat, regarding all violence as a failure of negotiation and diplomacy, which are the highest of the non-magical arts. Our garb, therefore, lacks the martial look and feel of most "armor"—but that doesn't mean it's any less protective than clanking suits of metal, for powerful protective runes are woven into the very substance of our robes. \n\nBOOTS\n\nIn the order, we wear boots of leather with reinforced toes, the whole enhanced by protective runes embossed and sewn in on top, front, sides, and back. For durability and softness, the hide of Psijic Domino Pigs is preferred.
I thought the werewolves were going to eat me at first, but they just threw me into this garden. They said that if I survived, I would be turned into one of them. I'm not sure what's a worse fate: dying a grizzly death, or becoming one of those monsters.\n\nI've been able to hide for a few hours now, but I keep hearing heavy footfalls behind me. A few minutes ago, I was even able to glimpse the top of the creature's head. There's a lurcher in here, and it's hunting me.\n\nIf I run out of hiding, if I'm killed now, I can at least keep my humanity intact. I keep telling myself that, but I just don't think I can go through with it. The same thought keeps running through my mind, again and again. \n\nI don't want to die.\n\nThere's no escape. There's no survival. May Stendarr have mercy on my soul.\n\n-Lantoine Beaufort
By Artuudawen Thousand-Shoes, Sapiarch of Apparel Analysis\n\nThe distinctive style of the robes of the Sapiarchs has not been designed so much as it's been refined, the style distilling the clothing choices of a hundred generations of the Wise. Every detail has its own deep history, all memorialized, of course, in the Apparel Archives of the Crystal Tower. The lighter styles of robes are for research in controlled environments, while the heavier, armored robes provide protection when a Sapiarch must do research in the field.  \n\nBOOTS\n\nMy favorite subject! Sapiarch boots are calf-high leather with turned-down tops, often patterned with metal studs that serve the dual purposes of ornamentation and protection. The same is true of the boots' metal toe-caps, which are often wrought in shapes that evoke the flow of Magicka.

Reaching Summerset\n\nI am reborn.\n\nMother has made it clear to me that the path I followed was not my own. That I'd be a slave to this world's rules and laws. That I'd be forced to walk the steps of another. I should be free, and free is what I shall become.\n\nFrom the darkness, a new dawn is about to break over this world. With the coming of this dawn, hatred, greed, and death will be wiped away. I am so ready for this to occur and I've never been more sure about the part I want to play.\n\nMother has offered me a position in the Court of Bedlam, a group dedicated to bring this new world into existence. But Mother's plans go well beyond even this prestigious group.\n\nMother has given me a new name. A new goal. Blood will be spilled. Lives will be lost. But in the end, the world itself shall change. No more pain. No more loss.\n\nNo longer am I daughter of House Redoran. Now I am a daughter of Nocturnal. \n\nMy name is Tundilwen, and I will burn the world so that a better one may rise from the ashes.
Resource cache uncovered: In a recess at the base of a cliff, opposite the Temple of the Eight, up-grade from the Gil-Var-Delle wayshrine. Not far from a suspiciously friendly hag.\n\nGrahtwood's natural beauty is subject to interpretation. For every towering graht-oak, the dense forest features some score or more horrible thing wishing to rip you open and eat your stuffing. Trolls, hags, stranglers, hoarvors — all frankly disgusting and unfortunately common.\n\nI would say "at least the mudcrabs have the common decency to remain on the coast," but the hoarvors are everywhere. They may actually be worse, as their hindquarters jiggle when excited. Disgusting.
By Telenger the Artificer\n\nSome of my peers dismiss our nautical neighbors the Maormer as mere Elven pirates, seafaring bandits with no more sophistication than Gold Coast highway robbers, but this is a mistake: though over time some breakaway clans have descended into near-barbarism, the core clans loyal to King Orgnum are organized and well-disciplined martial forces it would be a mistake to underestimate. I will try below to describe their typical arms and armor turnout. \n\nBOOTS\n\nIn line with the Pyandoneans' obsession with survivability should they end up in the water, their boots are light affairs made of (what else?) porpoise hide, and easily kicked off before they can drag their wounded wearers down into the depths.
Egg-Sire,\n\nI seek no forgiveness for my foolishness, despite your many warnings. By the time you read this, I have already gone to the Path of the Lily. I either saved the novices from Mewah-Jez's stubbornness or I have not. Either way, I assume I have been taken captive and scheduled for punishment. All because I do not want our tribe to keep killing its young because we utilize the training regiment of an idiot.\n\nI have gone against your wishes in another matter. You told me to destroy your old training manual, the one you used when you were our ka-deelith. I urge you to go to the place I hid it, retrieve it, and convince the raj-kaal, our war chief, to once again take up a sane and successful training regiment before all of our novices are killed.\n\nLet this verse remind you of our favorite hiding place:\n\n"Stand before the blue flame at the top of the stair,\nThen turn to gaze upon our Hist so fair,\nWalk straight into its beguiling trance,\nAnd find what you seek beneath its protective branch."\n\nKishi

By Uraccanach the Witchman (as transcribed by Juno Procillus, Academy of Chorrol)\n\nFor those who would honor Hircine the Hunter, it is right and proper to adopt the apparel and arms of his Huntsmen, those spear-shakers, fewterers, and whippers-in of the Lord of the Hunting Grounds. Just as his Huntsmen evoke Hircine's Aspects by their appearance, we honor him by emulating our prince's Huntsmen. All hail the Great Hunter! Even his curses are blessings! It is so, for I have said it. \n\nHELMETS\n\nAffixed to their stiff skullcaps of boiled leather, Huntsmen wear the antlers and horns of fallen Prey, for who should respect the Hunted more than the Hunter? And when we wear beast's clothing we are akin to Storihbeg the Skinshifter, and honor him thereby. Howl again, and stomp your heels like hooves!
You have a vine-tongue sapling in a tiny pot, ready to install in your new home. Now what? Simple! Now you do everything in your power to make and keep your little plant happy!\n\nEach vine-tongue is as different as you and I, so some experimentation will be needed to ascertain the best approach to raising your little sapling. In general, you'll need a long rake, a watering can, and a broadsword—they can get a little testy every now and again!\n\nWith these three basic tools, you can water your sapling, scratch its back, and make sure to dissuade them when they attempt to devour your neighbor's cat or the local children. Keep these tools on hand for the long and joyful years ahead for you and your vine-tongue!

by High King Emeric\n\nHaving found himself in command of the Empire after the deposition of the incompetent Kastav, Reman II's first notable endeavor was to negotiate a swift end to the Winterhold Rebellion of 2804. Reader, grant this thought due consideration—a new and largely untested leader was able to make peace with angered Nords without further unnecessary bloodshed. This was no mean achievement, and truly it demonstrated the quality of the man who would bring a golden age to the Second Empire.\n\nHow could a leader of such quality, one who not only calmed the rebellious Nords, but who subdued and united nearly all of Tamriel to usher in one of the most peaceful, productive intervals in recorded history, let the Empire come to ruin? I will divulge my ruminations on the matter, but not before recognizing the accomplishments of this remarkable man and the lessons to be learned from them.\n\nReman II was a master tactician, and studying records of the battles he fought shows not only his own acumen, but his respect for his troops—and those of the enemy. When he conquered new territory for the Empire, he established rule with a careful hand, avoiding too much disruption to local customs, traditions, and particularly to established trade. The Imperial culture spread, of course, but not through forced assimilation. Rather, the people came to accept and support the Empire by reaping the benefits of free trade, stability, and the development of better infrastructure. He gathered advisors from each province, and focused on his people more than many Emperors ever had.\n\nFor long years, peace prevailed across Tamriel. Necromancy and Daedra worship were abolished. Trade flourished, and, through the careful ministrations of Reman II and his councilors, the Second Empire thrived. And yet, the great emperor desired more. He turned his eyes to the provinces of Black Marsh and Morrowind, the unconquered territory weighing heavy on him. In the 2830s, he called forth the legions in an imprudent attempt to conquer Black Marsh. The losses to the swamp itself—its diseases and deadly beasts—nearly matched the number lost in combat with the Argonians, but the Empire managed to establish footholds in the northern and eastern marches by 2837. Reman declared Black Marsh to be officially annexed.\n\nIn perhaps his most critical folly, Reman II was not satisfied. He turned next to Morrowind and initiated the Four-Score War, a long, bloody conflict devastating to both sides. The battles were ugly, and the tenuous relations with Morrowind, which had shown some promise for diplomacy, were shattered. He perished fighting the Dunmer in 2843, and his heirs continued on as the Empire began to weaken, bled dry by the cost and wracked with dissent.\n\nAnd that is, perhaps, the greatest lesson that Reman II can teach to any leader: to keep ambition in check. His success catapulted him to greater and greater visions for the Empire, but in his desire to unify all of Tamriel, he compromised the beliefs and practices that made the Second Empire's golden age great, engaging in a hopeless war unwanted by his people and unneeded to provide them with security, free trade, and a prosperous Empire.
The loss of the Changling's corporeal form does not appear to inhibit my attempts at dissection, or her ability to vocalize her displeasure. Her spiritual body is similar to that of other souls unbound from their flesh that persist in Mundus. I have harvested small portions of ectoplasm for further examination, but I dare not push Selene's endurance too hard so soon after death.\n\n* * *\nSelene tugs at her bindings like any other wild animal. Bucking and braying until broken. I expected more from a reasoning creature, but it is a reminder that though she may take the form of Mer, she is not one. Once she's tired herself out I may continue testing her mutability in this form.\n\n* * *\nI must relocate. This vile forest is rife with damp, mold, and fungus. Preserving what's left of Selene's corpse is proving impossible. The wilderness to the south should be less humid and still near enough to Valenwood to preserve any ethereal links to it that the Changeling may have.\n\n* * *\nSpoilage ruined half of the reagents taken from the Changeling's body. I would be more upset by the loss if I were not already inundated with lines of research to pursue. It will not pose any significant setback if my theory that her body will reform in much the same manner as Daedra that are slain holds true.\n\n* * *\nAmputation poses no long-term harm to the Changeling, as expected. The loss of ectoplasm diminishes the spirit temporarily but has no lasting effect on their overall composition. Sadly, I did not have the opportunity to observe whether the same can be said for a Changeling's physical form.\n\n* * *\nSelene seems weaker today. Perhaps I've overestimated the extent of her recovery. I'll focus my efforts on the materials from her corpse and allow her to regain some of her strength. Not too much though.
Bakul,\n\nThis one has made a grave mistake. She was lured here by sugar-coated words and shining wonders that lost their luster the moment they were touched. There are Dragons here, Bakul. Real as the sand beneath our feet, but it's not Alkosh these Dragons toil for, this one is certain, though they know how to make every day seem an eternity.\n\nDairna has never heaved stone or laid bricks, but she has worked her paws raw to restore Sunspire Temple to glory. She did not mind this task at first, but her efforts were found lacking and she was lashed for it. She protested and she was lashed more. She disavowed this temple but she cannot leave.\nThis one has not always been your best litter-mate, Bakul, but she is still your sister. Dairna begs you. Tell the Mane what this one says. Do not come for Dairna. The Dragons and their servants are terrible creatures to behold.\n\nThis one prays her letter finds its way to you, though she does not know who she can entrust to carry it.\n\nIn faith,\n\nDairna
To Her Exalted Majesty, Queen Euraxia, \n\nThis report summarizes my conclusions concerning the Dragons that have made their presence known throughout Northern Elsweyr.\n\nThe Dragon that calls itself Mulaamnir defers to an even more powerful creature known as Kaalgrontiid. He has provided Dragons to support our efforts against the Khajiiti rebels. These massive beasts have been instrumental in many of our victories, just as you predicted. If only we could convince Mulaamnir to lend us more than a single creature at a time, we could retake control of the entire region!\n\nUnfortunately, the Dragons seem incapable or unwilling to discern a difference between our troops and the enemy. They take no care to avoid friendly casualties and seem to revel in destruction, no matter the target. I fear our control of these creatures is haphazard at best. \n\nMy recommendation follows. Order Mulaamnir to instruct the Dragons to obey the chain of command. Weapons work best when we can maintain complete control over their actions.\n\nAlso, we must perform a service for the Dragons to seal our alliance. I suggest we send an assassination squad to eliminate the last Dragonguard believed to be hiding in the Elsweyr wilderness.\n\nCenturion Jagus,\nRoyal Strategist to the Queen

By Landal Gevont, Scholar of Goblins, Invisible College of Daggerfall\n\nThe Coldsnap Goblins who inhabit the Frostvault and neighboring subterranean regions are definitely related to the other Goblinkin tribes of Skyrim, such as the Riekr Goblins of Wrothgar or their diminutive relatives, the Rieklings of Solstheim. But their arms and armor are unique, displaying a rudely dynamic barbarism that expresses their fierce pride and, it must be said, decided bloodthirstiness. I shall try to describe their defining characteristics in terms even common readers can easily understand.\n\nBOOTS\n\nColdsnap resourcefulness might best be embodied by their footwear. Despite being a mish mash of whatever hide scraps lay at hand, their boots are always snug fitting and sturdy. A testament to the tribe's knowledge of stitch work.
By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nFrom ancient times till the present, the Cult of Meridia, no matter how often suppressed, always rebounds and reappears. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, for a Daedric Prince, the Lady of Infinite Energies rarely requires genuinely terrible behavior from her worshipers, though she can be severe on those she considers enemies. Mortals who revere her often honor her by adopting an armor style inspired by that of the Aurorans, Meridia's Daedric warriors. This look is so consistent among her cultists in every place and time that one can legitimately say there is a "Meridian" style.\n\nBOOTS\n\nFollowers of Meridia favor metals even in the lightest armor, as their boots show. With the familiar touches of energy symbolism, these boots are not so much made for stealth as they are designed to withstand blows from necromancers and other typical enemies of Meridia.
By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force\n\nThis one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nThe greatest strength of Khajiiti martial arts is its quick movements. This is why Anequine leg greaves are lightweight with many independent parts, allowing warriors to maintain their flexibility. By the time our enemies move one step, we have already sprinted behind them and struck from behind.
By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval\n\nWhile it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. \n\nBOWS\n\nSince time out of memory, man, mer, and beast have all suffered death and defeat at the point of Pellitine arrows. The Wood Elves fancy themselves Tamriel's greatest marksmen, but their wooden pauper-bows cannot match the range or precision of their Khajiiti counterparts. A flexible metal frame, senche-gut bow-strings, and peerless styling make the Pellitine bow the envy of archers everywhere.

By Zayreba Sharpclaw\n\nFirst thing you have to understand about the Ruddy Fangs is that we're not just thugs, thieves, liars, or murderers; we're all these things. We're the scourge of Elsweyr, the bane of all who try to uphold good in this Moons-forsaken land. And we like to keep it that way.\n\nIf you have morals? Get rid of them. A code of ethics, a little nagging conscious telling you to do good in this world? No longer needed. All that's required is the will to get ahead, to do whatever it takes to end up on top. That's the only way you're going to survive.\n\nOur main source of gold is smuggling, both in and out of Elsweyr. You might head up into Cyrodiil with Sugar-Slinger, or work small town cons with Rideza the Rogue. Or perhaps you'll be lucky enough to work odd jobs with me. Whatever the case, you can be sure that gold will soon start lining your purse. Just be sure to not ask questions. The less details you know, the better.\n\nAh, and one more thing. If you've gotten to the point of reading this helpful little guide, there isn't really any leaving. Well, not alive anyway. So I suggest you get used to your new life, and quick.
By Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n\nWith respect to my mentors, who taught me to question everything. May we forever approach lore with raised fur and unsheathed claws.\n\nMuch of what scholars take to be true about Elsweyr is filtered through the bias and perceptions of those of Cyrodiil and other non-Khajiit loremasters and scholars. In fact, the geopolitical entities (which were originally Khajiiti clan names) of Ne Quin-al and Pa'alatiin are more commonly known as Anequina and Pellitine, respectively, due to the prevalence of Cyrodilic-based studies, the demotion of importance of native lore by non-Khajiit scholars, and the loss of native-based information. For a people who started out as nomadic clans with static locations only for trade and other social activities, attaching tribal names to locations as if these regions always existed is problematic because it implies ownership over certain terrain when, in fact, the clans originally moved as they needed to across the province now called Elsweyr. Some would note that the names Ne Quin-al and Pa'alatiin are Ta'agra, and while that is an acceptable observation, this one feels it is more accurate to use these names for the people and the Cyrodilic names of Anequina and Pellitine for their respective regions.\n\nInitially, a single Khajiiti Moon-Emperor ruled the region, and he later gave rise to the famous and esteemed Darloc Brae in 1E 461. During these days, sixteen Khajiiti clans roamed the province, and each performed a function. For example, the Ne Quin-al consisted of warriors and trained their members in martial disciplines and battle tactics. Some say that even then these clans belonged to regions or realms, but that is an oversimplification. Khajiit went where they were needed and wanted (or where they wanted to be), more or less. For reference, please examine the lullaby "Hasa Zha'ja" or "The Name Dance," wherein the first known story of how the clans earned their names exists.\n\nAs the clans mastered their areas of expertise and as outside pressures started pushing them into roles and more limited geographical areas, the concept of tribal regions coalesced somewhat even within the Khajiiti way of thinking. Thus it becomes more accurate to call both the people and the area Ne Quin-al, but only "more accurate" — not completely accurate. The poem "Zhan Zhab" ("Wind Game"), written by a clanless Khajiit in 1E 2243, shows the transition from clan name to place name as it unfolds, but questions the need for this even as the language shifts within the poem.\n\nThen came the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260. Due to the sheer number of deaths, tribal function changed lest the Khajiit die out completely due to starvation and other hardships. Sixteen clans became two and separated in ideology as well as into geographical areas. Those of the Ne Quin'al continued to roam and follow tribal customs, and they did so primarily in the arid northern region. Those of the Pa'alatiin stayed in greener, southern region and took on customs from other lands, especially Breton and Cyrodiil, forming political and social structures that closer emulated those peoples.\n\nAll of the above provides context for the differences between the Khajiit of Anequina and Pellitine. As those of Anequina continued to follow their tribal traditions in the harsher climes of the north, they looked to the south and saw only laziness, corruption, and weakness. By following the ways of others and abandoning their traditions, the southern Khajiit proved to the north just how weak-minded and feeble-bodied they had become. As for the Pellitine Khajiit, they looked to the north and saw only parched landscapes filled with militaristic barbarians. Rule through might alone was frowned upon by these southerners, and though permanent structures existed in Anequina, the fact that many still followed the paths of homeless nomads only underscored to Pellitine just how unenlightened the northern Khajiit were.\n\nTime passed, and the division between the northern and southern Khajiit grew. It took an act of marriage to start healing this rift. In 2E 309, rulers Keirgo of Anequina and Eshita of Pellitine married, creating the current province of Elsweyr. Though both peoples felt betrayed at this alliance, railing at the fact that they were now tied to the fortunes of those who seemingly did not share their values, the breach began to mend somewhat at first. Then, the first blows to the province struck: the assassination of Potentate Versidue-Shaie in Senchal in 2E 324, then the sacking of Ne Quin-al and the resulting slaughter of most of the royal dynasty in 2E 326 by Khajiiti rebels. Both these events weakened the fabric of Elsweyr's political structure, creating an opening for further instability to come. See, for further reference, the transcribed oral history of the period entitled "Zha'javan Ka'achin" or "The Dance of Dual Lands."\n\nPerhaps the inherent nature of the Khajiit prevented an immediate collapse of the government. Both those in Anequina and those in Pellitine tend toward independent thinking and adaptability, which makes it harder to completely prevail over them for any amount of time.\n\nBut, illness comes to us all, and when the Knahaten Flu struck 2E 565, it further damaged the shaky structure that was the Elsweyr government, creating an opening for the takeover of the city-state of Rimmen and the events that followed.

My beloved Adhimba,\n\nI'm sorry. I know you wished these voices I heard were only in my mind. That the images I perceived were my imagination. They are not, though. These visions—these voices that speak to me—they are something more. \n\nA divine presence speaks to me through this stone. I do not understand why these words seek me out, but the voice—it only grows stronger. With it comes the blinding lights. The strange visions. She's trying to find another knight to carry her light, she says. One who will not betray her. One who must correct a previous mistake.\n\nI'm unclear of its meaning, but I believe I must undergo her trials. I must succeed where others have failed.\n\nI will return to you in Black Heights once my journey is complete. I will show you the truth. You will see the light. Everyone will see the light.\n\nJ'saad
Sai Sahan,\n\nSince we began exchanging letters concerning the rage of Dragons loose in Elsweyr, I have been eagerly anticipating news of your reformed Dragonguard and the Dragon you have allied with. A remarkable achievement. I'm surprised you accomplished it without me.\n\nWe have important business to discuss. My own investigations have uncovered a threat to Southern Elsweyr. I am on my way to your Dragonguard Sanctum. And I'm bringing a friend. Make sure that you and your Dragon are available. Time is short and we must move quickly.\n\nOne more thing. You have been working with a mutual friend. The Champion of Anequina and the Pride of the Dragonguard. Make sure they are also with you. We'll need them to deal with this threat. Don't tell them, but they impressed me during our time together in Northern Elsweyr. Yes, yes, it surprises me as much as it does you.\n\nI'll arrive in Southern Elsweyr shortly. Be prepared for my arrival.\n\nAbnur Tharn
Aken is dead. We grew up together, ran races through the desert, played with sticks that were swords in our minds, and made gold fighting in other people's wars for years. When we settled on guard duty for the Shields, it was like an early retirement.\n\nUntil the Dragon came.\n\nWe were on patrol, just like every other day. The terror birds were in their breeding season, so the beasts were particularly ornery. Aken had this great trick he learned from an Argonian, though. You take a dried gourd and punch a few holes in it, then tie it to a long string. I told him he was crazy, but when he whipped that thing overhead it screamed like a pack of jackals and sent the birds running.\n\nI never told him what a good idea it was, damn fool me. Good idea, but ….\n\nAken, you damned idiot. There was no way it was going to scare off a Dragon. It ate him in one gulp and all I could do was stand there slack-jawed and pissing down the side of my leg while he screamed.\n\nI ran. I'm sorry, Aken. I'm a coward.\n\nAs it happens, you can't find absolution in the bottom of a bottle of jagga, or a jug of cheap Shornhelm wine, or even in that skooma crap. You just get a hangover and the sugar-shakes, then your throat feels like it's covered in hair. If you look to the gods instead, the priests will just give you some garbage sermon on how it is the will of the Divines and you can only find salvation in prayer.\n\nIt's all hogwash. They don't know a damn thing.\n\nI'm going to make it right, Aken. You always trusted me to watch your back and when it counted, I froze. I've strangled a gods-damned cannibal Wood Elf with my bare hands while he was eating my finger and rode down a rabid werewolf, but that Dragon was the one time my courage failed me.\n\nI've seen the Dragon flying in the distance for a few hours now. Circling. I think it knows I'm out here. I won't avenge you, but at least the ghost of our father won't curse me for a coward the rest of my days.\n\nI love you, brother. I won't be long now.
By Sidura, Navigator of the Perfect Pounce\n\nThis one notes that she received permission to look for equipment before she dragged out all the Dragonguard gear on Tideholm. In no way did she gain these items through ill-advised means. Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!\n\nMACES\n\nSidura recommends you handle the maces with care. The flanges on the two-handed versions are large, but even the one-handed flanges can bite. This one appreciates their ability to penetrate Dragon scale and hide, yet does not appreciate the cut she nurses currently due to these sharp flanges.
By Gwaerelos, Greenblessed Master of Arms, Elden Root\n\nThe Spinners will tell you that all the world is a tree. Evils burrow under the bark like weevils and drink the goodness out of life. The Green's warriors search the boughs, plucking vices from their hiding places and devouring them with relish. Transgression and consequence. Wickedness and payment in kind. We Stags exact that punishment. We claim that payment in blood. Z'en, god of toil and vengeance, demands nothing less.\n\nHELMETS\n\nA true Stag of Z'en should inspire more than fear. The transgressor must see the face of cold, dispassionate justice. We do not extract the toll on behalf of ourselves—we claim it in Z'en's name. So we hide our faces behind the mandibles and mask of a predatory insect. Insects do nothing needlessly. They lead their life of violence with an eerie calmness. As do we.
By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon\n\nSome believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.\n\nAXES\n\nThe blades of our axes mirror the majestic spread wings of our lord as he soars across the skies. The shadow cast as the blades descend upon those who would disrupt our rituals should evoke the same terror, before nothing is felt at all.

We intend these to be as instructive as they are decorative. The blades bite and tear like lord Laatvulon's jaw, so that the victim remembers exactly who the wielder represents.
A delegation from Lord Vivec of Vvardenfell presented this tablestrings to High King Svartr. Not accustomed to Dunmer tonal structures, the court musicians declared it "grossly untunable and overly complicated." For many years the instrument sat in the Blue Palace as a curiosity until it was recently discovered by Master Bard Endroni Selvilo of House Redoran. \n\nHigh King Svargrim generously donated this instrument to the college to further the understanding of the Dunmeri arts.\n\n("Still sounds like shrieking eels!" is scratched into the metal plaque below the inscribed words.)\n.
This pan flute belonged to the legendary skald and former instructor, Morachellis Hag-Husband. He was one of the few masters of this obscure instrument. Noted for his eccentricities, it is said Morachellis crafted the flute from the leg bone of his twin brother, who died in a mishap. Ever mischievous the skald would sometimes confirm this story and sometimes deny it.\n\nGiven the unsettling material of the flute and the questionable hygiene of playing it, Morachellis had few students to tutor and no successor.
By Amadri Drevin, student.\n\nThere are many different thoughts on the pronunciation of Dwemer words. I just sat through a discussion with my master and several other scholars. As always, "learned" scholars disagree. A lot. They also love the sound of their own voices, especially when it comes to Dwarven nomenclature.  \n\nAfter sifting through the Dwemer words passed down to us through history, most notably the names of places, and sitting through that long-winded scholarly review, I have distilled the knowledge to provide a guide on Dwemer pronunciation for other aspiring Dwarven scholars:\n\nHow to pronounce Dwemer words:\n	- First, inhale deeply\n	- Second, drink a full glass of mead or Cyrodilic brandy, whichever you prefer.\n	- Inhale deeply again\n	- Put four to seven smooth rounded pebbles in your mouth\n	- Attempt to say any word you like, but leave out most of the vowels and add extra consonants\n	- Emphasize either the third or fourth syllable in an exaggerated manner (even if the word has only two syllables)\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully pronounced a Dwemer word.
By Captain Thromkir of the Blackreach Vanguard of Dusktown\n\nThe few brave enough to venture to Blackreach found themselves in need of specialized protection early on. While this place remains unpredictable, it has a wealth of resources that are easily harvested and can be turned against it. Much of the process is still trial and error, but it's been refined to a point where I believe it's pertinent to take record of. I imagine the longer people exist in Blackreach, the more nuanced these practices will become. \n\nGLOVES\nThough Blackreach is mild in temperature, our gloves cover the whole hand and go up to the elbow. With the amount of strange flora and fauna here, touching anything you're unfamiliar with is just asking for trouble. Our gloves are made with thin Vale deer leather to keep them flexible and allow us to use weaponry while still protecting ourselves from the elements.
By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude \n\nThe Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.\n\nDAGGER\nAn ignorant observer might think the Host's daggers look flimsy. But as many can attest to, the thin nature of the blade, though it looks more apt to sting than stab, is just as deadly a dagger as any other. The precision the design lends makes it an especially dangerous weapon.
By Varcent Eardrey\n\nWe know very little about Sea Giants. What scraps of information about the elusive species we've gleaned thus far certainly fail to paint a clear picture. We're reasonably certain that Sea Giants are fearsome hunters, as harvesting great whales could be no easy task. That they stay such a mystery and point of terror for many seafaring Nords should be more than enough of an incentive to try to integrate their techniques into our own.\n\nBOOTS\nFrom what we can tell, Sea Giants use a great deal of bone in their weaponry. Logic dictates that they also use such methods in their clothing, minimal as it is. Whale bone makes for especially good structural support in footwear, as well as a strong offensive component when placed on the outside of the shin.

By Carena Esmery, Chronicler \n\nThe Orcs of Mor Khazgur are a particularly prickly bunch, even for Orcs. It wasn't easy to compile this information. I wouldn't have been able to do so at all were it not for a few patient miners who dealt with my constant questions with only slight annoyance and threat to my physical being. \n\nAfter leaving Wrothgar, the founding Orcs of the Mor Khazgur clan found a prosperous, rich mine and decided to settle there. In the early days, the mine was self-sustaining. The place overflowed with resources and the Orcs settled into a rhythm. They built their settlement around the mine and flourished. \n\nThe current mine Overseer, Overseer Thulsgreg, comes from a long line of leadership. His grandfather and father were the chiefs of the clan before him. They led the clan during a sort of golden age of the mine, when the mines themselves flourished. The clan saw a good deal of success and comfortable living even separated from Orsinium. \n\nIt was always assumed that Thulsgreg would inherit the mine from his father. Which is strange, considering he married beforehand. This clan isn't strictly traditional, but even still, that came as quite a shock to me. \n\nUnfortunately for him, as his father began to prepare to pass down the title, the Mor Khazgur mines dried up. Not completely, mind you, but the decline was quick and noticeable. The once prospering clan was suddenly confronted with the very real possibility of dying out. The mine would dry up, and they would have nothing left.\n\nThankfully, a new chief stepped up. A strong, young Orc named Urzikh challenged Thulsgreg for the title. She won, and immediately instated new mining practices to bring the clan back to its former glory.
By Lendantare, Outfitter Extraordinaire\n\nTo the majestic and most gracious Lady Thorn of Western Skyrim—\n\nThis letter serves as formal notice that my contract with you is now complete and that I have fully delivered the requested items. I speak truly when I say that your hospitality exceeds that of most kings and queens that I've served. Your servants have shown more courtesy than I expected from those with their nature. It is quite the shame we could not meet in person. I hope you'll allow me to boast that this may be my finest work yet.\n\nMACES\nAlthough intended mainly for bashing, I experimented here with a pointed design that should puncture and grip the target on contact. This mace's "bite", as I call it, will tear off armor or flesh that it makes contact with. Perhaps too gruesome for some, but you did not contract me to create gentle weaponry.
To be fabricated precisely to the exacting standards of the unmatched genius Arkasis!\n\nStone Garden proves to be an ideal location to conduct my experiments undisturbed by the average—by an astonishingly low statistical mode—inhabitants of this bumpkin land. However, it also drastically limits my access to expendable workers. To address the rate of attrition of my now limited supply of assistants, I have developed protective equipment that should reduce unnecessary fatalities and outlast the typical tenure of these peons by a factor of ten.\n\nBELTS\nDO NOT REMOVE OR INTERCHANGE BUCKLES, YOU MORONS! They are precisely formed to provide optimum balance and tension for the entire protective ensemble. I do not care if they dig into your oafish bellies!

Soon after the Longhouse Emperors came to power, the people of Cyrodiil sought to learn more about the Reach. One thing that fascinated them were the smells and the tales of strange food coming out of the Imperial Palace. When the daughter of a merchant published the letters sent by her father from Markarth, it became an immediate bestseller. This is the latest printing of that original work.\n\n* * *\nDearest Hipatia,\n\nI have arrived without incident, aside from an overlong stay in Rorikstead to fix our broken cart. I find the Reach just as your mother described it: sweeping terrain and crags that divide the landscape into uncountable pockets. Markarth is itself grand, though my pile of furs on a stone slab is a poor substitute for a bed.\n\nDo the children miss me? I wanted to tell them of an encounter my guide and I experienced as we made our way to Markarth. Please, read this to them before they go to sleep.\n\nHello, little doves. Your father may be far, but he thinks of you every sunrise. He's in the Reach! It is a strange place, and home to a strange people. They are fierce, mean people who shun strangers. But what luck! Father's guide knows a clan of these Reachfolk, who were holding a feast, and father was allowed to join!\n\nFeasts are rare in the Reach, little doves. The land is harsh. They grow no grapes or wheat, like we do. They eat hard things, like dried meat, or things we feed to animals, like oats. But on feasting-day, that changes! Many dishes are shared by the clan. Reachfolk eat with their hunting knives, a crust to sop with, and sometimes they have a tool like a short quilting needle.\n\nFather tried to eat as many different things as he could. Let me tell you about some of them.\n\nHircine's Share fills the center of the feast. It consists of several animals, spiced and deboned and stuffed one into the other. At father's feast it was a rabbit stuffed into a grouse, which was stuffed into a goat, which was stuffed into a doe! Larger clans, I hear, start with a whole bull and end with a mouse!\n\nReach Broth is more humble. They find stones with certain types of lichens on them. They boil them in a pot of water drawn from the Karth River. The thin broth that results has a profound sour flavor. For feast days, the broth is mixed with oats to make a kind of frumenty.   \n\nSmoked Trout and Salmon are cooked in milk to form a hearty stew. This stew is most often eaten when salmon swim upriver to spawn, when even small children can stand on the bank and catch them by hand — remember how hard we tried to fish at Uncle Faustus's villa that summer?\n\nArdknots were considered something of a confection—a combination of dried meat pounded into powder and mixed with rendered animal fat to make a paste. These are shaped into long threads and coated with something like flour (I never learned the name) so they can be shaped into intricate knots. The knot shape resonates with the Reachfolk, though I don't know why.\n\nWitch Water was the most curious item I tried. A secret combination of plants and seeds ground with a stone wheel into a paste, and then mixed with cold water. This creates something that is solid to the touch but fluid when stirred. As amazing as it looked, it was quite flavorless. But it was oddly filling. \n\nReachbread is like no loaf we have in the Empire. The Reachfolk dig up various roots, boil and peel them, then stuff them into a jar that is placed near a fire. What they scoop out tastes like an undercooked bread, but the crust is remarkable.\n\nApples are often placed in small stone bowls, filled with cream, and placed near the fire. These are almost exclusively given to children who behave themselves (which I learned after I ate one and drew more than a few stares).\n\nThe candlelight fades, little ones. I must stop for tonight. Await my next letter!\n\nLove to you all,\nFather
By Isa Truiand, Teller of Tales\n\nI collected these stories from various Reachfolk who were willing to speak with me. Many were reluctant to share anything with an outsider, but I stressed to them that I was merely a storyteller looking to share tales from all over Tamriel. Some were interested in trade, and I did my best to tell stories I've heard from others in the way the Reachfolk do —around roiling fires, with great emotion and presentation. In return, I gleaned a collection of Reach bedtime stories that I have recorded here.\n\n* * *\nThe Little Thinblood \n\nOnce there was a little boy. His father was a brave hunter and he wanted his son to be the same. Every day he trained the little boy to track and fight and kill. But the boy's heart was soft, and he did not care for fighting or killing. He wanted nothing to do with arrows and wildercraft, instead spending his time making fine clothes and listening to the vateshrans.\n \nOne day, the boy was out in the forest practicing with his father. A bear lumbered down the hill and surprised them. It attacked, trying to protect its young. The boy's father begged his son to help as he defended himself against the massive animal. But the boy could not hold a sword, nor could he notch an arrow. The fearsome bear defeated the boy's father, who even as he lay bleeding, urged his son to pick up a weapon and kill the bear. \n\n"Do as I taught you!" he commanded.\n\nBut the boy had been too busy with his needles and threads and the tales of the vateshrans. Fear rooted him to the spot. He thought perhaps the bear might listen to reason. \n\n"Bear, perhaps you'd like to hear a story …." the boy stammered.\n\nThe bear roared in anger, for it could not understand and never would. It sank its teeth into the boy's throat and killed him. As the boy died, he whispered to his father, "I am sorry, father. I only wish I had listened to you all this time."\n\nSo, children, do as your father tells you or get eaten by a bear!\n\n* * *\nThe Two-Faced Nord\n\nThere once was a clan-chief named Meroch, who tried to be friends with everyone. One day, a Nord rode in on horseback and asked to trade. Chief Meroch invited the Nord to eat with the clan and spend time with them. Many advised Chief Meroch against befriending the newcomer. He was polite and friendly enough, they agreed, but he was not of the Reach and therefore would never truly understand them. They warned the chief not to trust the stranger, but their warnings were unheeded.\n\nChief Meroch enjoyed the Nord's company so much, he invited him back the next day for a hunt. The two of them left camp together, laughing and seemingly enjoying each other's company. They went deep into the woods in search of game. While they walked, Chief Meroch told the Nord of the clan's dealings with the old spirits and their most secret traditions. The Nord nodded along agreeably and asked questions. The chief delighted in the Nord's willingness to learn. He thought he'd made a grand friend.\n\nThe two found their quarry. Chief Meroch offered his favorite spear to the Nord. "You should have the honor of striking the killing blow, my new friend," he said. The Nord took the spear, but rather than kill the deer standing in the clearing, he drove the weapon through the belly of Chief Meroch. \n\nMeanwhile back at camp, the Nord's fellow warriors laid waste to the clan. Without their chief, they were not strong enough to fend off the intruders.\n\nAs Chief Meroch lay bleeding, he asked the Nord a single question. "Why?"\n\nThe Nord laughed in a cruel manner and answered, "Because you have something we want. Now, we will take your land for our own."\n\nChief Meroch and his clan died that day, all because the chief was foolish enough to trust an outsider. No matter how friendly they may appear, those who are not sons and daughters of the Reach cannot be trusted. \n\n* * *\nThe Night Lords\n\n(Note: I heard different versions of this story from multiple Reachfolk, usually those who were older. The general theme stayed the same, however. I transcribed my favorite iteration here.)\n\nLong ago, the Night Lords ruled over the Reach. They prowled the shadows and their red eyes flashed like blood. The beasts of the field shrank away in terror. The trees shuddered and moaned in their presence. \n\nEven other monsters feared them.\n\nBe warned, children of the Reach, tucked away in your blankets. If you stray too far from camp after dark, the Night Lords might find you. And to them, the blood of Reach boys and girls tastes as sweet as honey.
Investigator Vale, famed solver of crimes and unraveler of mysteries, needs no introduction. Not even in the wild and untamed expanse of the Reach. When the caravan that was transporting her from Skingrad to Solitude continued north after a stop in Falkreath, it came under assault by a band of Reachfolk raiders. \n\nThree of the four caravan wagons were able to escape, but the fourth wagon, the wagon carrying Investigator Vale, broke an axle and was quickly surrounded by the raiders. The four caravan guards raised their weapons and were prepared to die defending the wagon and its goods and passengers when the investigator leaped down from the conveyance and stepped forward.\n\n"I invoke the Reach custom of a favor for a favor," Vale said, calling upon her research into the traditions of the Reachfolk. "Surely there must be something Investigator Vale can do for your clan-chief to secure our safe passage through your land."\n\nA few disgruntled murmurs bounced through the crowd of raiders. Obviously, they had been hoping to engage in some pillaging and plunder. As a striking woman stepped forward, the raiders fell silent. She was clearly a Reach-witch, and she was clearly the leader of these raiders.\n\n"I am Orana, clan-chief of the Spirit-Tale clan," she said with pride and power. "Are you truly the legendary puzzle solver from High Rock?"\n\n"Puzzle solver sounds so unimpressive," Vale said, "but yes, I am Investigator Vale. Do you have a crime or a murder I can unravel for you?"\n\nChief Orana smiled. "No murder. At least not yet. But offerings left by the various clans for the spirits at Hroldan Ring keep disappearing. Already, my clan and two others have come close to battle, thinking one or the other has stolen our offerings."\n\nVale couldn't help but notice the young male and female hunters trying to remain inconspicuous in the midst of the other raiders. But as Orana described the situation, they both threw nervous glances at each other and their cheeks turned bright red.\n\n"Very well," said Vale. "I accept. I shall solve this mystery for you in exchange for safe passage through Reach territory."\n\n"Then let us perform the ceremony of—" Chief Orana began, but Vale waved her off as she walked over to the two young hunters.\n\n"These are your culprits, Chief Orana," Vale proclaimed. "They didn't mean any harm. A prank gone wrong, am I right?"\n\nBoth young hunters nodded in agreement, clearly ashamed and clearly worried about what was to happen next.\n\nChief Orana's brow wrinkled and she said, "A hunter's prank. Yes, I remember. I was young once. Younger. They will need to repay the clans, but we will work it out.'\n\n"Splendid!" said Vale. "Then we can be on our way. Safe passage, as we agreed?"\n\n"Safe passage" the chief said with a smile, "after the ritual. We have a ritual for everything."\n\n"Of course you do," said Vale. "Well, we wouldn't want to offend …."
By Lord Idrisin, Bearer of the Scarlet Insignia\nA guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Nighthollow style\n\nDark, deadly, and elegant—these are the terms in which those few mortals who come to know our kind describe our arms and our bearing alike. One might be forgiven for presuming that the superb workmanship and exquisite proportions of the equipment we choose to employ in battle are the products of mere vanity, but I have found that these qualities are more than a matter of taste. The armor in which we dress for battle and the weapons we employ proclaim our identity and strike fear into the hearts of those foolish enough to stand against us. Yes, it suits the Nighthollow clan to remain in the shadows … most of the time. But when we step into the open, let our foes and thralls alike look upon us and know dread.\n\nBELTS\nA Nighthollow belt features a distinctively swept buckle plate, reminiscent of a vampire bat's outstretched wings. Graceful proportions and flexibility are more important than thick protection.

A Nighthollow mace features six fluted striking faces adorned with fearsome spikes. Few vampires prefer the mace in battle, but the mace is also a symbol of authority and rulership.
By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim\n\nNo other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the aetherium mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary stronghold of Arkthzand.\n\nAXES\nDwarven axes are double-bitted and made with durable metal hafts. They are significantly heavier than similar weapons created by other peoples, but well-balanced and extremely sturdy. Only the heaviest plate armor can withstand the bite of an Arkthzand axe.\n\nBELTS\nIn the Arkthzand style, a belt protected much of the lower torso and lower back. The buckle plate is quite large and supports an articulated flange providing additional protection.\n\nBOOTS\nIt seems evident that the Dwarves of Arkthzand valued protection over mobility. These armored boots completely encircle the lower leg and armor the top of the foot, too. An angular poleyn forged with a simple geometric design guards the knee.\n\nBOWS\nIt is difficult to call these weapons bows; they are better described as machines in the shape of bows. The artisans of Arkthzand made the limbs of the bow from inflexible metal, but hidden springs of great strength provide the flexing power needed to drive their metal-shafted arrows with tremendous force.\n\nCHESTS\nA cunningly articulated breastplate of Dwarven alloy, the Arkthzand chest piece is almost impenetrable. Sockets in the pectoral plates hold small orbs of luminous arcane crystal—the legendary aetherium mined in the realms of Blackreach. The aetherium crystals most likely empowered the armor in some way, but the secret is lost to time.\n\nDAGGERS\nDwarves generally seemed to favor axes and maces to blades, but when they fashioned daggers and swords they did so with great skill. The blade itself is made from an alloy that bears a superficial resemblance to brass, yet it is harder and more durable than steel. To this day, no one knows what it is made from.\n\nGLOVES\nCompared to most other elements of Dwarven armor, gloves seem surprisingly light in construction. The fingers are left unprotected except for small rivets over the knuckles—most likely so the wearer's ability to work on fine mechanisms would be unimpaired. A small socket in each vambrace holds an orb of aetherium crystal.\n\nHELMETS\nMost Dwarven helms cover the face, and the Arkthzand Armory pieces are no exception. The helm's visor is fashioned in the shape of a scowling warrior's visage. A prominent crest inscribed with geometric symbols crowns the top of the head.\n\nLEG GREAVES\nWell-articulated plates of superior Dwarven alloy guard the wearer's upper legs. The hip-plate features a common Arkthzand motif: a stylized eye in the form of an aetherium crystal orb, with geometric rays inscribed below.\n\nMACES\nLike their axes, the Dwarves of Arkthzand fashioned their maces with metal hafts just as tough and durable as the weapons' striking head. In fact, it can be difficult to tell Arkthzandi maces from axes at quick glance; the large, heavy flanges of the weapons bear a passing resemblance to axe blades. They are blunt, however, and maces mount four flanges instead of the two blades found on Dwarven axes.\n\nSHIELDS\nA large heater fashioned in the shape of a pointed, notched oval, an Arkthzand shield is made from a single piece of nearly unbreakable alloy. The decorative toolwork resembles a highly stylized eye with geometric rays emanating from it.\n\nSHOULDERS\nA truncated half-cone of alloy armor, the Arkthzand shoulder-piece is distinguished by a high flared lip on the inner portion to block any strike that might skip across the plate into the helmet. Embedded orbs of arcane crystal glow softly with small reserves of Dwarven magic, although the exact function is now lost to time.\n\nSTAVES\nIf the Dwarves ever worked in wood, no record remains of it. Their staves are made of light, strong metal alloy. Headpieces are shaped like small mechanisms, although how these devices actually contribute to the efficacy of Dwarven staves is unknown.\n\nSWORDS\nDwarven swords are fashioned from a strange, brass-hued alloy every bit as hard and durable as steel, and more resistant to corrosion as well. The blades are heavy and seem better suited to slashing than thrusting. Likewise, the grips are quite long in comparison to the overall length of the weapon, allowing for a wide two-handed grip at need.
By Mathinn Palard, University of Gwylim\n\nNo other people have yet matched the alloys and techniques the Dwarves employed to fashion their weapons and armor. Alas, many of the Dwarven secrets of metal-working vanished from Tamriel centuries ago. Likewise, some artifacts of Arkthzand providence also feature magical crystals—perhaps the "aetherium" mentioned in various mythic histories—whose purpose and powers are understood by no other peoples. Yet with a careful study of the pieces intrepid adventurers have recovered from the depths of the Dwarven ruins sleeping beneath the Reach, we can draw valuable insights into the designs favored in the legendary realm of Arkthzand.\n\nCHESTS\nA cunningly articulated breastplate of Dwarven alloy, the Arkthzand chest piece is almost impenetrable. Sockets in the pectoral plates hold small orbs of luminous arcane crystal—the legendary aetherium mined in the realms of Blackreach. The aetherium crystals most likely empowered the armor in some way, but the secret is lost to time.
By Arana of the Ghostsong Clan (as recorded by Count Verandis Ravenwatch)\n\nAs the Gray Host stalks our lands and preys upon our clans, the Despot of Markarth demands we freehands of the Reach come to heel and kiss his feet for the privilege of cowering in his cave of Dwarven stone. Fie on that, I say! But there's one thought the ard has betwixt his ears that's worth heeding: the deepfolk's bones are strong and they litter our lands. We must make use of them.\n\nThough I know not what Dwarves saw in the stars, I've seen how they marked the stone with the signs of our guardians in the sky. If the deepfolk sought the protection of the Witch, Hunter, and Headsman to create their otherworldly works, let us turn that strength against our equally unnatural foes.\n\nAXES\nWhether you claim the crests of the deepfolk's great guardians by cleverness or combat, they are well-suited for an axe befitting the Headsman. Though you will spend many days honing the sturdy metal to an edge.\n\nBELTS\nYou would do well to secure your waist with the locks from Dwarven doors and chests, for they are clasps that will not come undone in the heat of battle.\n\nBOOTS\nThe Dwarf metal we come by is heavy and often thick. Such things don't slow their lumbering machines on even stone, but they are ill-suited for fleet footedness upon wild ground. Use it sparingly.\n\nBOWS\nThere's nary a fletcher or bowyer among us who can work the Dwarf scrap into a suitable bow. Trust only the branches of Reach trees to commune with the wind, though yellow teeth will still bite deep.\n\nCHESTS\nClad your hearts in the guardian metal, but remember to fashion it to honor the Hunter, lest it fail to protect you as it did the Dwarves. We are his hawks and hounds in the Reach, show him as much.\n\nDAGGERS\nSurely your mothers taught each of you well enough to fashion your own knives, be it from stone, bone, or metal. A good sharp piece of scrap and a sturdy grip is all you need. \n\nGLOVES\nI've not yet met the set of bits and baubles that's fit for more than a cumbersome ring, let alone a gauntlet, but there are plates a plenty to strap upon your forearms.\n\nHELMETS\nIf you wish to keep your head, keep your wits about you. Barring that, the helms of the long dead Dwarves or their metal servants will serve you well, if you can see out of them. Do not neglect to cover your throat among vampires and werewolves.\n\nLEG GREAVES\nRemember we are hunters, not mud crabs. Keep your breeches fastened with only so much armor as you can keep swift in, and leave the clattering and clamoring of your loins for your marriage pacts.\n\nMACES\nThere are plenty of hunks of scrap about that would make a fitting cudgel if you were a giant and a half. Even Red Eagle would struggle to swing a solid Dwarven bar. Fix small flanges to a hefty club and it'll do just fine. \n\nSHIELDS\nTempted as you might be to strap a deepfolk door to your arm and call it a bulwark, it's liable to outlast your arm. Their metals clamor when struck hard. They'll shake and hum down into your bones and crack them. Lash what you can bear to a wooden shield and cushion the layers with fur and feathers.\n\nSHOULDERS\nAye, I've heard how you envy the great frames of the metal monsters. There's sure to be a pair befitting any of you waiting to adorn your worthy shoulders if you're brave enough to take them. Just try not to outdo yourselves until you're crushed under the weight like a bunch of fool-headed Nords.\n\nSTAVES\nWitch work and the Dwarf mischief mix like oil and water. Even Mora may not know how it is the deepfolk worked their will, but while that remains a mystery, I know all too well how a hunk of their metal will split a skull.\n\nSWORDS\nWe've few smiths among us, let alone any who could work a deepfolk forge. To come by a good balanced blade is as likely to be a matter of luck and a good scrounger's eye as anything. Keep sharp on the hunt and you may find something keen as yourself.
By Fortis Scaeva, Chief of Operations\n\nWelcome to the service of House Hexos! You now are part of a mercantile empire that extends far into the myriad realms of Oblivion. From our emporium in Fargrave, our agents pursue the goods of a dozen worlds and arrange for their delivery to discerning buyers throughout Tamriel.\n\nNaturally, our enterprise comes with certain risks. This is why we hire mercenaries such as you. Fargrave is safe enough, but our merchants require escorts to the strange realms in which they do business. The best practice is to deter attacks with conspicuously well-armed troops. But when deterrence fails, we must be ready to fight.\n\nSince we venture into hostile environments, House Hexos issues weapons treated to remain useful in storms of ash, corrosive swamps, or bitter icefields. And we expect mercenaries in our service to proudly wear the colors of our house: olive green, brown leather, emblems of deep red. In many planes, our safe-passage agreements require us to identify ourselves. Discard our colors at your peril!\n\nBOOTS\nOverlapping shin-plates of browned iron or boiled leather protect the Hexos guard's lower legs. Beneath this sturdy defense, supple leather completely encloses the foot. There are places in the Deadlands (and other planes) where you don't want to step unless you have secure and durable footwear.
By Doombringer Jayurth\n\nGreetings in the name of Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Destruction!\n\nA hard road lies ahead for we who serve the Waking Flame. The task of remaking a broken world must begin with sweeping away the unworthy. But weak and foolish as our enemies may be, they are many and we are few. This world will not be ended without a great battle. The last battle. A battle in which all the creatures of Nirn must choose a side. This is the work that the Father of Cataclysm has called us to. Hail to Mehrunes Dagon!\n\nNow, no battle can be won without soldiers. And while the Prince of Destruction commands legions of Daedra, we mortals have our part to play. The Waking Flame must be at the forefront of the fight for Nirn, leading the way with unflinching valor and unwavering zeal. Only thus can we prove to Mehrunes Dagon that we are his loyal servants, worthy of participating in his great design.\n\nThe special honor of leading the charge, of breaking the ranks of the unbeliever armies, naturally belongs to our strongest and most determined warriors. These are our ironclads, men and women whose physical strength is matched by their devotion to the Lord of Fire and Flood.\n\nZeal is the armor of the faithful, but Waking Flame ironclads are also protected by Daedric steel as strong and impervious as their faith. The moment an ironclad dons their mighty helm, they set aside the doubts and weaknesses of lesser mortals. They become living engines of destruction, thunderbolts with which the Prince of Destruction smites his foes! Implacable, indefatigable, inevitable—no foe can stand against an ironclad whose faith is strong! And when glorious destruction claims an ironclad at last, it finds Dagon's champion surrounded by the crushed and broken corpses of the unbelievers.\n\nThis is the path of the ironclad, initiate. If your faith matches your strength, then it can be your path as well. Hail to the Prince of Destruction! Hail to Mehrunes Dagon!\n\n(Bring this pamphlet to your ranking disastrix when you decide to volunteer.)
By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan\n\nOurs is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nSimple yet noble was my goal for our weapon design; and even the treacherous daggers maintain this feel. The blades are etched with an elegant pattern of my own design. The hilt and guard are coated in bronze for strength.
Designs by Renowned Master Armorer and Metalworker Edmund Mido\n\nA guide on dressing and armoring the supplicants of the Waking Flame Cult in the fashion to best please Lord Dagon and commit atrocities on the tiresome "innocents" roaming Tamriel. \n\nThese are the accounts of my life's designs and works. Do not make me look like a fool or seek to 'improve upon' my designs with your lesser input. I tailored my life's work to serve Dagon. I crafted each piece to evoke the Prince of Fire and Flame's destructive might. Your ill-advised input into these designs—should you be stupid enough to attempt to provide it—is unneeded and will not even be successful. My work is perfection itself.\n\nGLOVES\nThe greatest feature of my glove design are their clawed fingertips. If you forget the claws on any of the gloves you create, I will personally show you exactly what they are used for. Do not test my patience on this.

By Geem-Shah, Singing Mouth of the Naka-Desh Tribe\n\nMany dryskins blame us for killing the Kothringi. They twist their faces and spit dry words like "murder," and "conspiracy," and "witchcraft." Even now, long seasons later, people still believe the Saxhleel conjured up the Knahaten Flu. I wish they could peel the hate from their eyes and look up-river to the days when I was a hatchling. Back then, the people of the root and the silver-skin tribes walked hand-in-hand, bound by mud, good food, and cheerful dancing.\n\nI have many memories of the silver-skins. When I shut my mortal eyes, I can still smell Kuusa's heel-snail kabobs drawn fresh from a clay oven. I can hear the tin-chimes sing as they jangle at Dassil's waist. I can feel Old Haduk's rootfoam scrape down my throat and warm my belly. But what I remember most of all is the music. The shimmering songs without end. I miss those songs most of all.\n\nWe Saxhleel have a multitude of musical instruments, both simple and not-so-simple. The Kothringi, however, had many, many more. Indeed, my egg-sister and I used to joke about how anything could be an instrument in the hand of a Kothringi. Their tree cutters turned hollow logs into wamasu-sized drums. They plucked the sinew from cliffstriders to make low humming bow harps. The instruments they loved best, however, were their chimes.\n\nUnlike people of the root, Kothringi had no distaste for metal. While they rarely wore clothes, they did wear bits of metal on thin strands of rope that tinkled and jangled as they walked. Their metal-tamer, Baelah, would cast lumps of tin and copper into his great fire pit and draw them out hot, twisting and molding them with a stone mallet until they took the right shape. After the metal rods cooled, he would hang them from tree boughs and strike each in time to take the measure of its song. Baelah made hundreds of these chimes, intent on taming every sound that metal could make. \n\nOne warm night in Nushmeeko, he summoned the tribes to his village for a feast. I do not know why they feasted, but we did not care. When the feasting was through, we all gathered around his great singing cypress and listened to his family play the chimes. Eight Kothringi—his wife, uncle, and five sons—leaped from root to branch like sure-footed treefrogs, tapping the chimes with their song-sticks. The sound it made echoed in my chest like the gentle child of a thunderclap. Each of us felt our hearts burn bright as a torch, and many of the silver-skins wept joyful tears.\n\nWhen dryskins say we killed the Kothringi, I think of that night in Nushmeeko. Had they heard what I heard and saw what I saw as a hatchling, they would know that no child of the Hist would destroy something so beautiful.
By Treads-the-Stars\n\nOf all the planes in Oblivion, it would be difficult to find one less welcoming to travelers than the Deadlands. The legions of Mehrunes Dagon stand guard, watching for spies, invaders, or escaped prisoners. Deadly monsters roam the landscape in search of prey. The climate varies between deadly volcanic eruptions and bitter, howling windstorms that scour the barrens. And the terrain itself forms a torment of razor-sharp rock, knife-edged ridges, and sheer chasms. Yet here the traveler may see sights that few mortals ever get to witness—provided they can survive.\n\nPreparation is the key to surviving a journey into Dagon's realm. First, pack all the food you will need for your visit. The Deadlands have earned that name for a reason. You will find little to eat there, and what you can find presents poor fare indeed. Bring as much water as you can carry. A desert of lava occupies half the realm, while the other half consists of a desert of stone. Even if you stumble across a spring or a pool, it is likely to be tainted or unfit for mortal consumption.\n\nMost important, make sure you know how you intend to leave Dagon's realm when you are done with your visit. Many of the portals that lead into the Deadlands are fickle or untrustworthy. They often permit a traveler to enter, but do not function as exits. If you do not have at least three means of egress, you are not prepared to visit the Deadlands.\n\nThe easiest way to reach the Deadlands is to first make your way to Fargrave, the Celestial Palanquin. A plaza on the outskirts of the city harbors two permanent portals leading to different parts of the Deadlands. These are reliable, and lead to deserted regions that Mehrunes Dagon's forces rarely patrol. Be wary of portals you find in Nirn or on other planes, since they often deposit you in the middle of fortresses or dungeons (and often do not function in both directions).\n\nNow, as for the Deadlands proper. Mehrunes Dagon's realm is divided into regions. Two prominent regions well known to travelers from Fargrave are the Burn and the Sever. The Burn is a volcanic wasteland, dominated by rivers of lava and the iron citadels full of Dagon's legions. The Sever is a cold, windswept desert of stone. In the vast distances between the great citadels, fierce monsters and desperate scavengers abound. Between these two regions stands a nameless range of jagged mountains with few passes.\n\nAs a suggested itinerary for the intrepid traveler, begin by taking the Fargrave portal leading to the Burn. Turn west on the road that passes close by the portal platform. This leads to the brooding fortress known as Burning Gyre Keep. Look upon its ancient towers, and move on—you will find no welcome here. Continuing to the north, you will pass the terrible prison-mine known as the Blood Pit. Here, many who displease the Prince of Destruction toil in misery for the duration of their miserable lives. You do not want to join them.\n\nA high, tortuous pass winds through the hills north of the Blood Pit and turns eastward toward the great citadel of Ardent Hope, foremost of the seven hundred and seventy-seven that house Mehrunes Dagon's legions. This area is heavily patrolled, so the citadel is best viewed from a distance. Continue east into the hills above Ardent Hope, and you will find a tunnel that leads to the Sever. This brings you to the doorstep of Destruction's Solace.\n\nHere, you must not linger. This seemingly dead city is Mehrunes Dagon's seat of power. If you find the gates standing open, do not enter!\n\nFollow the path descending eastward through the dreary plains of the Sever until it meets a north-south road. Your way lies south, but take care. A terrible Havocrel is doomed to tread this path for eternity, challenging anyone he meets. But soon you come to a region of broken badlands, where a path to the south leads to what may be the one safe refuge in this region of the Deadlands: Wretched Spire.\n\nWretched Spire is built around the wreckage of a great temple that Mehrunes Dagon long ago pulled into the Deadlands from some section of Nirn. It is a haven for outcasts and scavengers—those who seek to elude Dagon's sight. For some reason, Dagon's servants never venture near the place, and a small number of dishonored Daedra and lost (or escaped) mortals have made a settlement of sorts here. It is a hard existence, but here at least a traveler can find rest and provisions of a sort.\n\nFrom Wretched Spire, your road continues eastward to the highlands marking the eastern extent of the Sever. Here you can find the portal leading back to the safety of Fargrave. But if you wish to behold one last sight of Mehrunes Dagon's realm, continue north just a little farther and you will come to the False Martyrs's Folly. A dead forest that clings to the dreadful vales of the Sever's mountains, the Folly is said to imprison the spirits of those who defied Mehrunes Dagon. Decaying insects of horrible size and pestilential imps lurk in these woods. Again, it is not wise to linger. Look upon the petrified remains of Dagon's foes, then depart while you can.\n\nGood luck to you, traveler!
Golden goblets overflow with wine\nA sultry dancer with eyes so fine\nA circlet of rubies crowns her head\nTangled blankets as you fall in bed\n\nHot grease drips into the blazing fire\nGrapes dangle as mouths open with desire\nBlue velvet and golden trim abound\nSo many sordid delights surround\n\nBut what is the cost of such wonderful things?\nNo amount of gold can hide the rot it brings\nFangs lurk beneath brightly painted lips\nAs innocence falls like arrows from our ships \n\nWe dance until our tired feet bleed\nGorge upon all the delicacies and mead \nThe lovely deception will tarnish the gold \nWhen we finally realize how much we've sold
From the journals of Remius Volsonus\n\nFor six days I have been studying the elusive death hopper. My colleagues called me crazy. Perhaps I am. It takes a bit of insanity to go tracking down a frog the size of a horse. But what good researcher doesn't love a little danger? Putting my life at risk is well worth having my name stamped in history as the first one to write about such a magnificent creature. \n\nDeath hoppers are generally encountered in packs. If you see one alone, you must watch for others. These gigantic frogs enjoy lurking just beneath the surface of the murky water they call home. A patient hunter, it often waits until its unsuspecting prey makes the mistake of wandering into its path before it attacks.\n\nThe first thing to know about encountering a death hopper is that it is extremely poisonous. I am unable to get close enough to determine if the toxins excrete from their skin, but I do have a plan to do so soon. I will update this record accordingly. However, I was able to discern that they can spit their poison over a great distance. I've seen the large globs of toxic matter eat through all sorts of materials. I shudder to imagine what it might do to unprotected flesh.\n\nThe second thing you must be aware of is that the death hopper uses its incredible size to its advantage. This creature is known to hop high in the air and come smashing down upon its prey hard enough to stun. Then, the death hopper leaps to the side to confuse its dazed victim before making its final, and usually lethal, attack. In my days of studying this creature, I've seen it swallow large prey whole. But inside its mouth, it houses hundreds of thin, exquisitely sharp teeth. Chewing through bone is no difficult task for the death hopper. \n\nI am endlessly fascinated by this gigantic, murderous frog. And my research has only just begun! I can only imagine what more I might learn about the death hopper. But first, I must get closer!
By Tirdos Renam, Smith of the Arcane\n\nMad! Mad, they call me! These flat-headed smiths with their smoldering forges no larger than tea kettles. Should we not heed the challenge of Boethiah? Should we cower in the face of the Testing Gods? These sour-hearted cowards may be content to hammer out nails and nixshoes, but not I. I look to grander things. Distant realms! Mighty tools! Designs that exceed mortal handiwork in every conceivable respect! Compared to Daedric craft, even the keenest Nirn-blade is no sharper than a butter knife. The sturdiest Dunmeri shield affords less protection than a sheet of Daedric parchment. I will pry these secrets from the blazing corner of the House of Troubles by sweat and blood.\n\nThis journal shall serve as a fulsome account of what I find wandering the Destroyer-God's realm. With these designs committed to the page, I shall return to Morrowind not as a simple smith, but as a master of the Daedric forge!\n\nSWORDS\nDremora favor the sword above all other weapons. Unlike Daedric axes, their swords seem designed for piecing and gouging rather than cleaving. This compliments the Kyn's martial style which focuses on brutal stabs and relentless forward momentum.
By Keshu the Black Fin\n\nMany outsiders assume the Black Fin Legion is an army of Argonians whose purpose is to protect Argonians. They are mistaken. We serve all people who wish to live in peace, Man or Saxhleel. It is my belief that we can best defend our new home in Gideon by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our neighbors, not by fighting to protect only our own. People of all races are welcome in the Black Fin Legion—a stout arm and a willing heart are all I ask.\n\nThe first enemy that an army in the borderlands of the Black Marsh must face is the climate itself. Here, iron and steel rust without special oils, bowstrings rot, and weapon hafts made from northern woods begin to warp. From head to toe, the Black Fin legionnaire must dress for conditions that destroy the arms and armor of other lands. But if the swamp is an enemy to the unprepared, it can also be a potent ally for the warrior who learns its ways.\n\nGreen, of course, must be the primary color of the Black Fin Legion. In the forests and swamps surrounding Gideon, the value of camouflage cannot be overlooked. Highlights of brass and gold may seem out of place, but they too have a purpose. They mimic the glint of sunlight on water.\n\nAXES\nAxes are both weapons and tools in the Black Marsh. The Black Fin legionnaire never knows when they must clear a path through a thicket or fell trees to make a raft. For this reason, our axes are single-bitted weapons with a hammer-like flat opposite the blade. The haft is made from brass or bronze. It may not be as strong as steel, but it resists rust.

By Captain Rian Liore\nA guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Ivory Brigade style\n\nThroughout history, the city of Leyawiin has been able to rely upon the protection of the Imperial Legion. Alas, those days appear to be over. With the collapse of Imperial authority and power, each province of the Empire has been left to look after itself. If we are to protect Leyawiin from the depredations of pirates or invasions by the warring alliances contending for the Ruby Throne, we must raise an army of our own—an army of the Blackwood—to deter aggression and keep the peace.\n\nAs the commander of Leyawiin's forces, the task of organizing this new army has fallen to me. I have always felt that the first step in making soldiers is to teach new recruits that they serve something greater than themselves, and to take pride in that service. To put on a uniform is to proclaim an allegiance and forge a bond of loyalty with those who wear that same uniform. At the same time, a prudent commander must consider the tools his soldiers will need to carry out their duties, and the resources available. To that end, I will now enumerate my expectations for the proper equipping of the army of Leyawiin.\n\nFor our coat of arms, I have selected an ivory horse on a field of green, the ancient symbol of Leyawiin. And from this brave device our army takes its name: the Ivory Brigade, defenders of the good folk of Blackwood.\n\nCHESTS\nAs one might expect, the armor worn by the Ivory Brigade is derived from the traditional design employed by the Imperial Legion for centuries. Bronze is somewhat heavy, but it is softer than iron and bends rather than shatters under a heavy blow. Lighter chestpieces replicate the same design in tough, boiled leather, which still offers good protection against slashes and glancing blows.

Winged Beasts That, For Whatever Reason, Have Not Been Included In a More Standard Chapter in This Book. Sections provided by Domind Kamaz and Junior Researcher Unila Rotheloth.\n\nCROW\n"These winged blights on the small patches of sky I happen to like best, do not, under any circumstances, tolerate me or my presence. This may have to do with the curse that was placed on my family by a Hagraven a few generations ago. With the locals taking care to warn us of the over-intelligent nature of the crows in this area, particularly around Arpenia, I have decided to graciously delegate the entry for these despicable creatures to my assistant, Unila Rotheloth."\n\nField Researcher and Avian Expert Domind Kamz\n\nAs with everywhere else in Tamriel, crows can be found in even Gloommire, at the far southern reaches of Blackwood. To borrow from earlier editions, crows can range in size from being as small as one's hand to rumored reports of one stretching the expanse of a man's forearm in body. With black beaks and primarily black feathers, they can make striking figures against stark landscapes. These feathers also allow them to blend surprisingly well into dense forests and marshlands. Which, coincidentally, is how I remained completely unaware of the small family group that was following me back to base camp, but that's something I will touch on later. \n\nColloquially, crows are intelligent, creative creatures. This is mostly true. I should make mention that a non-zero number of corvids were witnessed to fall out of their tree-top nests. It was unclear whether the specimens were displaying this ability out of their own cognitive failings or due to a sense of enjoyment. \n\nWhat can be discussed with some clarity is that the crows appear to hold grudges. Not only that, but they can pass the memory of past slights down to their young. I witnessed a display of the very behavior described above when a family of crows followed me back from my research gathering trip to where Domind was waiting for my report. They dropped a series of stones on him, I was unharmed, and then proceeded to swoop at him with such ferocity that he ran towards the nearest shelter and refused to leave for a week.\n\nHACKWING\nMany readers would be surprised at my including these creatures in a book entitled 'Birds of Gloommire.' They resemble other creatures that would be identified as a bird in no way and morphologically could be better classified as a small Dragon.\n\nThis is, of course, completely false. Hackwings display many of the same characteristics as a bird and if we must include the sooty rats of the sky (see the Crow entry) under the noble term of bird, then surely the hackwing qualifies as well.\n\nA bird is a winged creature that lays eggs and soars in the sky. Though some creatures we call birds may fail at one or more of those qualifications (see Terror Bird and Flight). The hackwing, notably, has wings, lays eggs, and can take to the sky as easily as any bird. For these reasons, it has been included. \n\nIn terms of behavior, the hackwings skulk around rocks more often than a standard fowl might. They use their long talons to gain purchase on the craggy outcroppings and rough bark of the trees in the marshlands. Often, they waste the day away sunbathing on the rocks and stealing fruit and meat from the baskets of unsuspecting locals. Despite the thievery, these creatures have not yet been witnessed eating the stolen goods. They prefer to feast upon corpses left by the sides of roads and, presumably, on the joy of their own mischief.\n\nOn a personal note, I quite like hackwings. They're fun and playful and only slightly life-threatening. Their temperament means that they are more likely to rummage through your carefully organized campsite, rooting through your bedding and overturning inkwells, than they are to attack you and try to pluck out your eyes.
A record by Ghalzir of the House of Wayfarers in Rimmen.\n\nBy first impressions, there is nothing that stands out about the shrine to Sithis that resides next to the main road through Glenbridge. This isn't to say that the shrine is not noteworthy, only that first impressions are often misleading. The building is tall, towering at a height that rivals most of the trees nearby and the height is only exaggerated by the lack of structures that appear around the shrine. The walls are made of thick stone slabs and faces peer out of the stonework at every corner of the structure. But still, in comparison to the xanmeer towering in the near distance, the shrine is not impressive. \n\nInside the shrine, the walls press in closely, invading the space which is only large enough to host four bodies. Even with three walls left open to the outside world, it is hard to breathe within the shrine itself. Standing in the center of the space feels as though there is no air at all. \n\nThere are places where the stones have fallen or been knocked to the side. This continues on the inside of the shrine as well and, with a distinct lack of light, gives the shrine a dilapidated look unfitting of most places of worship. The priests did not seem concerned when asked about the shrine's appearance, though they did seem offended at the suggestion that the fallen stone slabs should be set to rights. After some conversation and careful questioning, it became clear that the priests viewed the shrine's state as being a marker of Sithis's work. Fixing the walls of the shrine would be an act of sacrilege. \n\nWhile it may not be clear if Sithis had any direct impact on the shrine's appearance—if the stones were knocked loose due to his power or if weather and time are to blame—it certainly has an impact on the priests who care for it.

By Chief Archivist Bartholomew\n\nLike our namesake, the liveries of the venerable Knights of the Silver Rose have grown haler and more beautiful with each generation, tended by collective wisdom and guidance of our order. Here I record the essential elements of form and function in our arms and armaments as dictated by Prior Theirric Sarazen, Knight-Commander of the Silver Rose, 2E 579.\n\nSTAVES\n\nSilvered-steel staves are the primary tool of our battlemages, allowing them to withstand a melee and deliver bone-breaking strikes on mortal and Daedra-tainted foes alike. The silhouette of a rosebud represents the potentiality of magic waiting to bloom in the hands of a mage.
By Kynmarcher Korisala, Chaos in Battle and Subcommander of Ardent Hope\n\nEach day that passes, Lord Dagon's plot to conquer Nirn proceeds apace. The God of Ambition will not let that which belongs to him by right lie fallow for long. As he gathers his strength and readies for another sortie, so too must we prepare ourselves. With the blessing of Valkynaz Nokvroz I hereby order a new line of armor and weapons to be forged for our elite warbands. \n\nMay the Annihilarchs of Dagon rise to the challenge of a blood-red dawn!\n\nBOOTS\nFlared spikes at the knee joints will give the enemy pause. Place them here, and here, just so. Our warriors will wade into battle, gutting the pitiful wretches that dare to cross our paths. No one who sights an Annihilarch in full body armor will doubt their dread purpose. In Dagon's name!
Though the parcel he was carrying was not concealed, I conducted a strip search of the courier. He is obviously unusual for a messenger and I'm not taking any chances. Here's what we confiscated:\n\n-	One sealed letter and a medallion in a wrapped parcel\n-	One silver flask (emptied the dregs of some cheap swill into the tide pools)\n-	Leather coat, shirt, and breeches (reeks of sweat, booze, and a dozen different colognes and perfumes)\n-	One steel saber (unremarkable and, judging by its condition, mostly just for show)\n-	One unfinished poem (the kind of drivel you'd spout to seduce an idiot)\n-	Loose nuts and crudites (he must have stuffed his pockets at the ship's canteen before we grabbed him)\n\nHe had a number of bruises that couldn't have come from his kidnapping, as he didn't put up a fight. I hazard to guess they came from another entanglement of the sort I don't care to imagine.

Thoughts on the meaning of destruction for those who serve the Flame Tyrant, by Quiston Merian.\n\nDestruction. The utter obliteration of what once existed. Destruction inspires awe. It is thorough, all encompassing.\n\nWhen a house is destroyed, it is rebuilt to the specifications of the inhabitants. Their needs and desires shape the form of the building. Or, the house is rebuilt as a shop, a temple, or even a park. In cases such as these, the initial destruction leads to the overwhelming happiness and benefit of those affected by the event. This proves that destruction is a force for the advancement of good.\n\nWhen a coup overturns a ruler or council and tears down a system of government for not abiding by the inherent rule of law—that it must serve the people as well as its own needs—no reasonable person bats an eye. The political upheaval exists to right the wrongs thrust upon those the rulers were meant to serve. In circumstances such as this, only traitors and idiotic loyalists would look to their old leaders and attempt to reestablish what came before. If the system had been efficient and served all its citizens fairly, then the coup would never have occurred.\n\nDestruction accomplishes all these things and more. So why does it harbor such bad connotations? The answer is simple. Mortals blessed enough to witness annihilation—the likes of which is only possible through the power of true destruction—grasp only the traumatic nature of the event. They lack the objectivity and knowledge to see the possibilities brought about by such wonderful devastation. When all you perceive is the eradication of what you relied upon—a home, system of government, a city, or a person—then a future beyond that does not seem possible. But it is. Annihilation for its own sake is not destruction, it is only cruelty.  \n\nDo not fear destruction. It serves as a force for positive change. Believing in its curative powers is not a fallacy, instead it reveals an astute knowledge of the fundamental principles to which we all abide—the very principles espoused by Mehrunes Dagon.
By Devastator Irenian Dast\n\nLast night the Lord of Flood and Fire favored me with a glimpse of his realm.\n\nIt came in the silent moments before dawn, a dream so vivid that it paralyzed me in my bed. My disembodied soul sped across a waste of fire and ash. Rivers of molten rock twisted through razor-sharp hills, as a sky of fiery storm clouds churned overhead. Before me rose the dark walls of a mighty citadel. Rings of forbidding stone towers climbed the slope of a burning mountain, guarded by a legion of Daedric warriors.\n\n"What is this place?" I asked in my dream, awed by the vision I beheld.\n\n"You look upon the citadel of Ardent Hope," a great voice thundered in reply. My dream-self was drawn then through three gates along a path of hot cinders, to the heart of the burning mountain. Here a lake of lava seethed within a huge crater. Seated upon an islet throne, his feet awash in the molten rock, Mehrunes Dagon—the size of a tower himself—awaited me.\n\nEven though I was a mere wisp of spirit in that place, I prostrated myself and groveled before the Mighty Lord. "Command me, O Lord, even though I am but an unworthy worm!" I cried.\n\nMehrunes Dagon smiled. "Then remember what you see here, worm," he said to me. "Count Ardent Hope's gates, measure the towers, bear witness to the vastness of my legions. When you return to your mortal shell, tell all whom you meet of the strength at my command. I am power, and I am inevitable. Only in service to me can your feeble lives find any meaning. Now come."\n\nLord Dagon became a cloud of burning cinders and flew up into the sky. I followed, dragged along in his wake, as we left Ardent Hope and its volcano and ascended to a second citadel. This one stood upon a high mountain pass, overlooking Ardent Hope. Here there were no fires, no rivers of lava, only bitter winds scouring the barren rock.\n \nI was drawn on through silent courtyards beneath broken walls and black gates. Here no proud legions stood arrayed for battle—only tormented ghosts who cowered in the shadows. In the ruin of a great roofless hall, Lord Dagon reappeared, brooding upon a throne of cold black stone.\n\nI dared not speak, but I knew that I must. "What became of this place, O Lord?"\n\n"This is Destruction's Solace, twin to Ardent Hope," Mehrunes Dagon replied. "Once I reigned over all my realm from this place. I filled these halls with my servants and the trophies of my countless victories. But then I laid it to waste and destroyed all within."\n\n"But why, Lord Dagon?" I asked, shivering in my terror.\n\n"Because I am Destruction, and it is what I must do." Dagon swept an arm across the empty court. "Remember the ghosts, measure the devastation, bear witness to the finality of my purpose. When you return to your mortal form, tell all whom you meet of what you have seen. By my hand alone shall their ends be given meaning. Now go."\n\nHe dismissed my bodiless spirit with a gesture. I awoke screaming in my bed, my eyes seared by what I had seen. I do not know why Lord Dagon chose to grant me—a mere devastator, only nine years in his service—such an honor.\n\nBut I will do as my lord commands.

By Bastibien Marolles, Historian\n\nThere are several stories about the source of power in Tor Draioch. Some feature the usual culprits, such as an evil witch or a vengeful chieftain who turned to dark magic to slay his enemies. The histories vary, but one thing remains certain: Whatever occurred at this tower in the distant past has left a mark. The most prevalent legend is called "Sorrows of the Wind." A fanciful tale to be sure, but one wonders if a grain of truth rests at its core. Locals say the motes that blink in and out of sight sometimes are the remnants of a mournful, terrible spirit named Windsorrow.\n\nThe story goes that the isles were once home to creatures of nature, Elven or human in appearance. The existence of such creatures has never been confirmed and may be bardic fancy in service of a good story. Certainly the earliest inhabitants of these isles were powerful magic-wielders who shaped the land and sea. Over time, the archipelago was discovered and settled by men and mer, and if any of these ancient inhabitants remained, they stayed mostly hidden. A female ancient, lovely and fair, was said to be so attuned to the breeze that moved over the isles that her clothing and hair constantly moved, as if stirred by the wind. She fell in love with an ancient chieftain who settled nearby and left the hidden places of the archipelago to live with him. \n\nThe tales say she bore him two children, both bright and beautiful. After many years, she learned of her mother's passing. Thus, she left their home and children to return to her own people. When she returned from her travels, she found that her husband had abandoned her for another. This other woman was dark of heart and jealous. She clouded the mind of the great chieftain with magic. Worse, and more tragically, she poisoned the two children so that her own issue would inherit all.\n\nThe spurned wife might have weathered the betrayal of a spouse, but her grief at the loss of her children unbound the winds. (So the legend goes). Wild with pain and sorrow, she razed everything in her path for days. A group of brave souls—druids, chieftains, warriors, and witches—fought to rein her in and stop the violent winds so the isle could heal. \n\nThe lovely dell where Tor Draioch now stands was the site of this ferocious battle against the creature they named Windsorrow. Her grave rests somewhere near the tower, or so the legend says. According to this version of the story, the motes that flit about the tower are manifestations of her spirit, as well as her childrens', who are buried alongside her. Other stories say that she was never conquered, only subdued, and that she may return one day to tear High Isle apart, rock by rock.

By Miramel Charascel, Chairperson of the Gonfalon Bay Historical and Social Society\n\nAmenos stands as a somber reflection of High Isle, sitting across the straits to the northeast of the primary island in the Systres Archipelago. The place has a long, dark history that only serves to enhance the already dismal reputation the island currently enjoys. We here at the Historical and Social Society wish our neighboring island was a less lethal and more inviting location, but one supposes that criminals and political prisoners must be housed somewhere, and Amenos seems well suited to the task.\n\nOur earliest records of settlements on Amenos are limited, but we believe the Druids of Galen settled all four islands of the archipelago when they arrived from High Rock around 1E 330. Amenos has always been the most hostile and unforgiving of the four islands. Whatever magic the druids were able to instill on High Isle, Galen, and Y'ffelon to "balance nature," as they say, never seemed to fully take on Amenos. In 1E 660 or thereabouts, the so-called Lefthanded Elves arrived from Yokuda and began their conquest of the archipelago. They found a foothold on Amenos and constructed a fortress there to serve as their base while they assaulted the other islands and laid siege to Y'ffelon. Who knows what state the archipelago would be in today if the Lefthanded Elves hadn't been consumed in the eruption of Mount Firesong in 1E 676? What few remained on Amenos were wiped out by the encroaching Ra Gada in 1E 785.\n\nLater, the archipelago came under the jurisdiction of the Akaviri Empire. In 2E 11, Potentate Versidue-Shaie converted Amenos into a penal colony for Reman-aligned political prisoners. Though rule of the archipelago has shifted a number of times in the intervening years, two things have remained true. The druids care for the islands from their wilderness encampments, and Amenos is still a prison for criminals of the worst sort.\n\nDuring the age of the coin-barons, pirates infested the waters around Amenos. Perhaps the greatest of these were the Systres Sisters. Legend has it that they built a vault on the island to store their treasure. The vault could only be opened with three keys—one held by each of the sisters. It is said that one key is hidden in the southern jungle, a second in the west. The third was lost when that sister was killed after the three pirates had a falling out.\n\nToday, Amenos features three primary locations: Amenos Station, the Stockade, and the Jungle. Amenos Station, the port town, contains the only safely navigable approach to the island. The rest of the coastline is ringed by jagged rocks, nearly continuous storms, and dangerous currents. Many ships have been wrecked attempting to reach other parts of the island, but only the bravest or most-foolhardy captains dare risk their ships without good reason.\n\nAmenos Station serves as the island's port-of-call, and prison transports regularly bring supplies and new prisoners for transfer to the Stockade. The town has some amenities, but it is no Gonfalon Bay. It basically exists to support the Stockade and the jailers stationed there, the port, and any mainlander gadabouts who decided to visit to experience the "thrill" of the prison island. House Mornard oversees and maintains the town.\n\nThe Stockade is just that. An enclosed prison to house the prisoners delivered by the transport ships. The Jailer's Keep overlooks the Stockade, and a small army of jailers (some House Mornard retainers, others hired mercenaries) guard the place and make sure the prisoners stay in line. In the Stockade, you can find two types of prisoners: the trusties, well-behaved convicts to whom special privileges have been granted, and the typical prisoner, who is waiting to be processed or has already been processed and is awaiting banishment to the Jungle.\n\nProcessing and banishment. Not much is known about the process the prisoners are subjected to, as House Mornard guards such secrets well. It is said to be some sort of magical or alchemical process that renders a prisoner incapable of surviving outside the Amenos Jungle. Once undergoing this process, a prisoner is banished into the Jungle, where they must remain or suffer instant death. Now, some speculate that this is only a story, but the prisoners believe it. It keeps them contained to the Jungle, in any case.\n\nNow let's talk about the Amenos Jungle. Deadly plants, natural hazards, and carnivorous beasts abound, so lone prisoners don't survive long after their banishment without some sort of assistance. This comes in two primary forms: prison gangs and labor contracts. Rumor has it that dozens of gangs of banished prisoners roam the Amenos Jungle, gathering in close-knit groups for protection and to better survive the dangers that surround them. The most powerful of these, according to House Mornard reports, are the notorious Green Serpents. For the prisoner who wants to go a different way, House Mornard and its retainers offer an alternative—labor contracts. In exchange for room and board and guaranteed safety, a prisoner can sign on to work in a mine or labor camp. Much of the Mornard wealth is generated by these operations.\n\nSo there you have it. If you do decide to visit our prison island, stick close to Amenos Station and avoid the Jungle. Better yet, avoid the entire island and enjoy the much better amenities in Gonfalon Bay.
My Dreadsails!\n\nI promised you a haven, and now the path to our new home lies before us. I have struck a bargain with a powerful druid of Galen, one who will help us secure a stronghold on the isle.\n\nIn return, she requests that we acquire a relic held by a rival circle—the Eldertide. Raid the isle's eastern coast and search for this relic. If it can't be found, take captives for questioning. There must be a lorekeeper among the Eldertide druids who knows how to find it.\n\nDo not fail me. For the price of a druid relic, we get a new home!\n\nSealord Nalos
A genealogy and in-depth study commissioned by Lady Larina Merchad, 2E 541.\n\nAfter an exhaustive study, I can say with reasonable certainty that what your family has always suspected is almost positively true. The Merchad bloodline is indeed an ancient Breton bloodline, dating back to the first appearance of the Half-Elf race in High Rock. Further, I have found clear evidence that the family as it is known today can trace their ancestry to druids who arrived in the Systres Archipelago with the original flotilla of the Druids of Galen. The very same that departed High Rock in the First Era.\n\nMore over, I feel confident in proclaiming that not only were the Merchads members of the Bretons' original druidic ancestors, they were also clearly of royal blood—if you consider Druid King Kasorayn to be equivalent to the aristocrats who govern High Rock in the current era. Add to that what we know of the Volorus bloodline, and your son will inherit the best of both dynasties.\n\nWhy else would House Merchad's heraldry be rendered as three cups spilling seeds and leaves if not for their druid connection?\n\n<What follows is a complicated genealogy working backward from the time of the writing to the ancient days of the original Druids of Galen. Kasorayn, the last Druid King, is clearly shown in the family tree. The last entries, from the time of the writing, appear as follows.>\n\nLady Larina Merchad, 2E 521—\nLord Lucan Volorus, 2E 516—\n(Married 2E 538)\n\nBacaro Volorus, 2E 540—

By renowned scholar and student of all cultures, Ignatius Galenus.\n\nFrom the records of my journeys across the druidic isles of the Systres Archipelago.\n\nI knew since landing on this isle that my presence would be unwelcome. It was a necessary risk, taken to record and preserve the knowledge of these druids who refuse to leave their island home. Even if it was to the detriment of my own well-being, I knew I had to persevere. But danger lurked in every corner and the warm reception I received from the Stonelore druids on High Isle and Galen was severely lacked when I arrived on Y'ffelon.\n\nMy studies of the islands and the druidic structures led me to seek out the local druids, knowing that they would be able to bring a depth to my account that I could not achieve without their guidance. Context is invaluable for any scholarly document. As I said, the Stonelore were generous and gracious, the Eldertide less so.\n\nWhen I approached the Firesong, the druids of Y'ffelon, with quill in hand, they looked upon me with confusion that became stoicism before quickly turning to anger. I greeted them and began with benign questions, yet with each they appeared to grimace deeper. I jotted down their reactions to my inquiries and took their silence as a mere device of communication employed with non-druids. Then one stepped forward and pointed at me. In reaction, I raised my hands as a show of non-aggression, yet the ink on my quill had not fully dried. Thus, globs were flung into the pointing druid's eyes—quite by accident, you understand.\n\nI thought it best to extricate myself from a bad situation and began to back away from the druids. With each step I took, they followed. As inconceivable as it may be, I do believe they meant to do me harm! It was with much haste that I made it back to my hired ship and begged the captain to cast off. I regret that I was unable to get much more than this out of the druids who shelter beneath Mount Firesong, but such are the twists and turns of scholarly research.\n\nUntil next time my fellow scholars.
Investigator Vale stood on the dock, peering intently at the blue expanse of ocean that stretched to the horizon. This was her first visit to Galen, though she had traveled to the Systres on numerous occasions, but always before to High Isle.\n\n"What say you, investigator?" asked the Knight Commander. "Was this the work of the dreaded Darkmasts?"\n\nVale sighed and turned once more to gaze upon the body that lay upon the wooden planks. He was clearly one of the locals who worked on the docks, a burly laborer who smelled of sea air, ship oil, and now, unfortunately, death. \n\n"It is convenient to blame pirates and Sea Elf marauders for every disaster and death that befalls anyone close to the sea," Vale said, "but this crime doesn't have any of the usual markings of a Sea Elf raid."\n\nThe Knight Commander frowned. "Are you so certain, m'lady? Adalard the dockworker was clearly killed here at the pier, and look at the violence done to him. I've seen the Darkmasts do much worse."\n\n"Exactly! Have you known Sea Elf pirates to come ashore and make but a single attack? Without looting or pillaging anything? And these wounds, they weren't made with a saber or mace, the typical weapon favored by the Darkmasts. No, this man was killed with a docker's hook. And whoever did the deed employed it as a weapon multiple times before poor Adalard succumbed."\n\nAnother dockworker, Baralyn Lemonds, who had been standing back far enough to not be in the way but to still hear whatever Vale and the Knight Commander were saying, pushed forward. "No, I saw the Darkmast ship with my own eyes!" he bellowed. "Twas Sea Elfs that kilt Adalard! Sea Elfs, I tell ya!"\n\nThe Knight Commander stepped to impose himself between Baralyn and Vale. "Calm yourself, Baralyn," he said sternly but not unkindly. "We have your testimony. Now let the investigator do her job."\n\n"One moment, Knight Commander," Vale interjected, "if I may. Dockworker Baralyn, is it? I can't help but notice that you don't have a hook hanging from your belt. I've never known a competent dockworker to go anywhere without their docker's hook."\n\nBaralyn's eyes narrowed and his expression turned ugly. "Just what are you implying, woman?" he demanded.\n\nThe Knight Commander looked from Vale to Baralyn and his own expression grew concerned. "Answer the question, Baralyn. Where's your hook?"\n\nInstead of answering, Baralyn shoved the Knight Commander toward Investigator Vale and turned to flee. Vale, ready for such a move, easily stepped aside. She casually reached down to pluck a fish from a crate—obviously what was left of the morning haul—and threw it at the dockworker. It hit him squarely in the back of his thick neck with a satisfying thrump, knocking him senseless. He collapsed to the ground in a heap.\n\n"When you find Baralyn's hook, you'll have the murder weapon. This wasn't the result of a Sea Elf raid," Vale explained, "it was an argument between co-workers that got out of hand."\n\nThe Knight Commander secured the unconscious dockworker and turned to Vale. "I suppose it's easier to believe that trouble comes from outside than to accept that it lives among us."\n\nVale selected another fish from the crate, sniffed it, and deposited it in her pack. "For supper," she said. "Deduct the cost from my fee, if you would. But you're correct, Commander. We prefer to think of those around us as part of the community. Safe. I find, however, that most murders are committed by people the victim knew than by some random act of a chance encounter with an unknown villain."\n\nAs she turned to leave, Vale added, "But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be on guard against those Darkmasts. They may not have killed your dockworker, but they are dangerous nonetheless. Now if you'll excuse me, I want to find someone who knows how to prepare this particular fish. Do you have any recommendations?"

About to set sail.
Near the remnants of a House caravan.
Sneak behind the relic-thieves' camp.
Beside a bridge to Amol.
Be Shor to search all over the stone.
Sighted by serpents in Mistral.
Where Covenant forces pour forth.
Near the river, disentangled.
Within earshot of the cheering crowd.
Outlaws strike skooma deals here.
Secret shrine by Pelin's Church.
Sent away to stay with the dead.
East of the bastion of deceit.
Entombed in the Orchard.
Cradled in a ruined temple hall.
Surrounded by frozen fungus.
Under shroud and ground.
On a stonecutter's scaffold.
On an islet in the subterranean lake.
In the darkest depths of Orcrest, where all the pipes converge.
Tucked away on the highest scarp of Predator Mesa.
Across a rope bridge in Moonlit Cove

We can't let Faolchu's curse spread to Aldcroft. Do what you can to help Gloria. \n\nI trust your abilities.
I have told you all I know about what happened here. If anyone knows more, it will be the Spirit Guards who patrol our walls.
Over the years, I've questioned many times whether what I did was right. I wanted to save my soldiers' lives, but I only helped King Ranser spread his curse.\n\nNow, whether right or wrong, I am redeemed. The curse is lifted and the dead can rest.
What have I gotten myself into? If I get killed in battle, it's on your head.
As if being defeated wasn't tragic enough. I can't believe we have to force the king to surrender.\n\nNonetheless, I can't ask the men to throw away their lives for a lost cause.
The Bloodthorns are holding the Duke in the lighthouse. You'll have to fight your way in there if you really plan to rescue him.
Ah, it's you.
What's this? Can't you let a man enjoy a moment's rest? Are you telling me King Emeric needs this bench right now?
I've paid my debt in full. Off with you now!
I bet I'm going to be having nightmares for a long time after all this.\n\nTimes like these I miss having my father around.
Things are settling down. Soon, we'll best these filthy ogres.
Ah, listen to this. I'm working on a new ballad - here's the end bit.\n\nThe Dreamer has awakened,\nHis former wrath abhorred\nWith Reason's grace\nDishonor chased\nAnd Hosni's house restored.\n\nIt's about you, you know.
You don't think I had anything to do with that, do you?
Perhaps I was too quick to pass judgment on you.\n\nThese people, including my sister Olyna, owe you their lives.
Sisters, let me talk to this stranger.\n\nWe are busy. Please make your business quick.
Some of the Bloodthorn escaped. I'll send a runner to warn Daggerfall.\n\nAt least you stopped their rituals. I'll consider that a victory. Hopefully, that wizard you rescued can help, too. In the meantime, we have a town to clean up.
The stables are not as busy as they once were. Still, I will care for all beasts that seek shelter within.
I think you're ready to advance to journeyman. \n\nYou should travel to Daggerfall to be tested.
You were able to hear the voice of Hermaeus Mora?\n\nThat's unfair. I worked my whole life for such an honor and I hear nothing.
Got blades of all kinds, friend—some stronger than others. \n\nYou want some advice? Leave them flimsy-arse scimitars to the locals. Get yourself a bastard sword. They're strong and trustworthy—just like me. Ha!
The wind bears the scent of burning metal. I fear there are darker days ahead.
The heart is yours, yet the coral lives. Once I saw it was dying, I had no choice but to join myself with the coral. \n\nWe are one now. It's not where I expected to end, but these roots go deep.
At Davon's Watch, you helped put the Covenant to shame, but one battle does not win the war.
The guar must've liked the way you smell. Good noses on guar, yes?\n\nAfter all the years I've spent around these pools, all I can smell is sulfur.
All is now clear.\n\nYou must defeat the <<1>> to break the curse.
The Mother attends to greater threats and relies on Sildras to care for her children. Make sure he knows this.
Good luck getting those crystals.
You should talk to my father, Grandmaster Tanval. He leads House Indoril.
You won't tell anyone I tried to dig through stone, will you?
The fighting in the Worm Cult camp died down, but I'm hearing screams.
The urns of Nerathren and Faryon are in the chapel beneath this temple.\n\nTake some of their ashes. Then cast them into the eternal flames in the north and south towers.
Diiril was headed for those ruins on the south side of the gorge. \n\nNaryu and I will stay up here until the plague blows away.
Though I speak, do you truly listen? I suppose time will tell.
We can't thank you enough for what you've done. I hope my offering helps in your endeavors.
Give me a moment to catch my breath and I'll meet you outside.
What were we talking about? Please, Mistress. Don't hurt me.
Welcome to trouble. Our little Captain Rana doesn't know what she's doing.
Well? Is it done?
I've failed my duties as a spinner. The story comes first, above all emotion. Above all pity. I pitied the Hound, but it was a trap.\n\nAnd now, the Silvenar and the Green Lady will always have, and always should, join as one.
You can get into the storeroom now.
Poor, misguided Valeric. I wonder what weakness drove him to this terrible end? I shall grieve for him. In my own way.
Has the friend of the Silvenar found the distasteful bits? Only then will the path be clear for our friend.
Jakild and I are lucky you came along when you did, friend. Once the draugr settle down, we'll get back to work on Bonestrewn Crest.
Please, let our people pass to Sovngarde. They … they must be in so much pain.
You're not as clever as you think, mortal. I will kill you!
You think you're so clever, mortal. Remember this: I will kill you!
Get moving. Those boats won't spontaneously combust on their own.
You'll never find those clothes without me. I've hidden them too well.
That poor man! Such a terrible thing.
Be quiet. I don't want them to notice us.
We'll do what we must, with no help from you. Dog of the Jarls!
I see no malice within you. Is there compassion in its place, I wonder?\n\nDo you seek to purge the poison within the henge?
You performed a great service for the dead. Thank you.\n\nI look forward to hearing your tales in the halls of Sovngarde one day.
I hear much merrymaking. Perhaps that secret ingredient is good for more than a severe hangover.
Without your help, the tale of Andewen in Ezduiin would have gone very differently, I think.\n\nGood luck in your travels.
Next time you find yourself in Vulkhel Guard, drinks are on me!
Thanks. Sorry, still a lot to do here.
Yeah? What is it?
I heard the Queen and the High Kinlord are safe! All thanks to you.
Clever. Very clever. Poor woman. Even taken beyond these walls, no accountant is ever freed from her greed.\n\nI am <<1>>. Welcome to my laboratory.
Thank you for all you've done. These ancient relics embody all that the Companions stand for.
Let's keep moving.
I hope the Stars—and the Queen—can forgive me. I don't know if I ever will.
I hope you were able to get the warning out.
Leave me be, stranger. I'm a very busy man.
<This Altmer is dead. He was badly beaten before his death.>
I heard Almion was coming to check on me when he died. This is all my fault.
It's not a party until someone gets eaten! Ha! I'm just yanking your vines. Probably.\n\nSo. Who's hungry?
We're back, thanks to you. Let's see the Vanguard try to kick us out again!
Heard what you did on the docks. Fine work, my friend. What can I help you with?
The crew of the Albatross knows what you did. If the Queen's Own Navy takes us in, we'll make certain everyone else knows, too.
Oh my … that was quite a rush. Thank you for the experience, new friend!
If you'll excuse me, I have healing potions to craft.
This is outrageous! I am a captain of the Fists of Thalmor! By what authority does a mere sergeant keep me detained?\n\nWhen my superiors hear what happened this day, <<1>> will be court-martialed!
I'm out of shape. Give me a moment.
<Captain Helane is unconscious but still breathing.>
You're no Steel Shrike! At least, you don't look it. Did you get caught in their raid too?
Good luck down there, recruit. Make the bastards pay.
The baron looks hurt. See if he'll tell you what's going on here.
So first you freed me, and now you saved the king? You certainly do keep busy. You're an inspiration too. \n\nI hope we run into each other again.
This won't end well. And it's all on you, my friend.
Step lightly! Fenlords do not keep lazy servants. They could be on us in a flick of a tail!
Well, that was fun, wasn't it? All right, maybe fun isn't the right word. But you were glorious!\n\nAngof is finally dead. We can't thank you enough for what you've done.
By the Green! One of those damned Senche got me.
<The guard no longer responds having fallen back into a deep sleep.>
I can't believe he stood me up. The nerve. I mean… just that I was looking forward. To working with him.\n\nBah! That's it. I'm done!
I don't believe a word Jakarn says, but there's just something about him. He's fascinating.
You've made it through alive. The other Keepers must be dead, then.\n\nA part of me wishes it were not so.
Well, now. What brings you to our humble abode?
I fear that justice would have been better served by my death. \n\nI pray your judgment does not prove to be a mistake for the future of the Covenant.
She's going to stay. I can't believe you and Bowenas believe she can change! Once you've touched that kind of darkness. The Green take you both!
MmmMMmmf MMMF!
Saldir becomes less reliable all the time. I need to find a new supplier. The wounded here can't wait for Saldir to saunter into town.
I quiver like a leaf in the wind to think of what we'll learn from these ruins.\n\nWe'll be careful, of course. It would be unfortunate to allow something like this to happen again.
Cordial greetings and welcome to our tower—an isle of knowledge amidst a vast sea of ignorance.  \n\nHave you come for training?
Well met. I'm the resident librarian. We don't have much, but what we have I care for. \n\nHave you found anything to add to our collection?
You heard Sangur. Get going.\n\nI'm sure I'll be around when you return.
I should really go check on my father.
It's about time the Pact took Fort Rayles. Be nice to see new faces in town.
For the honor of the Covenant, Fort Rayles must be retaken!
Why hasn't Fort Rayles been retaken? Has the Covenant no more swords?
We're going to start over. We'll build a better life.
Are you ready for the next round?
Are you ready for the next round?
We'll contact you again soon, my friend. As soon as we have word of Sees-All-Colors. You can count on it.
I cannot believe she went through with it! \n\nAll I can say is thank Ruptga that I have other daughters. I will not even allow them to talk to Forebears!
I think next I'm going to take my team and go do a nice safe dig on a beach in Auridon. Maybe we'll dig for, you know … clams!
There is a potent magical energy beyond this barrier of vines. Maybe it's Carindon's fabled spirit, maybe it's this "Selene." \n\nEither way, I'm not returning to the Guild hall empty-handed.
I'm going to take Lorwen with us when we go to return the bones. I figure she has some blood in this now, right? I don't think she'd let me leave her behind, either.
Blessings of Tu'whacca be with you. Alas, we have much to do before meting out vengeance to the Withered Hand.
As you can see, this is a horrible place. They just dump the bodies anywhere, and the predators, these harpies, come to feed on the corpses. \n\nMy Zariya … she does not deserve this. She has done nothing wrong!
I haven't seen my husband since the Dominion attacked. I wonder if he's all right.
The faster you return with the blood, the faster you get your antidote. And trust me, it's not something you want to put off for too long.
Why do these things keep happening to me, I wonder?
This one sees you have survived many battles. Buy my armor and survive many battles more, yes?
I hope you brought the key. We're ready to make the final push, but we're finished if we can't get inside.\n\nThis is our last chance to save our world. It's all or nothing now.
And here comes the great and marvelous Vanus Galerion—right on schedule and just in time to take all the credit.\n\nI think he wants to talk to you.
Let the King know what you decided so we can get this assault underway already!
Be at ease. This is but a simple misunderstanding between merchants who bumped carts. No lives will be lost here.
I need to get away from these birds. With Brindle in friendly hands, maybe they need cooks. First meal would be chicken, if I have my way.
So the Covenant took over Castle Brindle. Is that supposed to make me feel safer? Well, it doesn't.
I hear you cleansed the blight. We're mighty grateful.
I'm going to have to figure out how to discretely return all of these things ….
I allowed your intrusion because it was obvious this would end in a clash of wills. It proved … enlightening.
I wish you luck in Malabal Tor. I hope to see you at the joining of the Silvenar and the Green Lady.
I slave away in this hot kitchen but Duzal still buys meat pies from Shasirba. I need to learn her secret.
Good show! The portal belongs to us now! \n\nSir Darien and that lovely lizard have gone on ahead. I think he might be a bit intimidated by our prowess on the field of battle, and he's trying to compensate.
This one wonders, why are you still here? Don't you have a great mage to rescue or something?
Thank you. We were on our way to Longhaven when the Argonians struck. Free my companions and meet us there. I'll repay you however I can.
Yenadar's grace be upon you. And Kala's prayers go with you as well.
Split-Tongue hears Rakhad no longer hides under the rocks of S'ren-ja.\n\nThis is good news for Split-Tongue, for his tongue was split by Rakhad's minions. It is a small kind of revenge for him, yes?
This one hears all sorts of good news this day!\n\nAbout this thing and that thing, this friend has a pregnant mate, that friend met someone new in Rawl'kha, and best of all - that stink of skooma is all gone from this one's town!\n\nA good day, yes?
I admit I was worried about my cousin, but you have settled the question as to her fate. I'll miss <<1>>, but at least I know what happened to her.
These lands are so lush and green.\n\nAre you looking to trade?
Even though it was a trap, I wish I had had more time to explore the library. Imagine the treasures and knowledge I could have acquired!\n\nAt least Kireth managed to grab a couple of books before we left. I can't wait to start reading them!
Welcome back, comrade! What's the news?
What is it, comrade? Make it quick.
This <<1>> business is deplorable, so close to <<2>>. No doubt the Mages Guild will take the blame for it all!
You wished me to remain in my home, and I will. But my servants cannot distinguish you from an intruder.\n\nGo … take the portal to the relic thieves, and do not trouble us further.
I was wondering if you were going to make it. I hired one of these little boats to ferry me down the Bay. Whatever it takes to get as far away from that trolls' den as possible.\n\nIt's expensive, but I have the coin to spare now.
If you and Adusa hadn't shown up, we all would have fallen to those monsters.
We'll find Sai Sahan, and if Mannimarco gets in our way, I'll chop that sniveling knife-eared puddle of troll piss into little bite-sized pieces.
She's gone. Lakana. She was the bravest of us. She was our hope.\n\nI've heard only rumors surrounding her demise. I don't know who cut her down. But mark me, friend … if I find him, he'll suffer a lengthy death.
You have spoken. I have listened.\n\nNow we are finished here. Move along.
Well, look at what the wolf dragged in. I certainly wasn't expecting to see you again so soon.\n\nOf course, you're always welcome here, as far as I'm concerned.
If you hear anything of Falinesti in your travels, please send word to <<1>>. I expect I'll be traveling with him for quite some time.\n\nAfter all, I am quite adept at driving off the frost trolls.
Ah! You're staying with us? How nice! If <<1>> can help you in any way ….
Sahan doesn't look well at all. Keep an eye on him.
No need to alarm yourself, friend. This is merely an illusion, and all part of the treethane's plan. \n\nSpeak to Fariel. She'll explain everything.
You found them both and returned safely. Thanks to you, I still have a sister.
I'm glad Constable Agazu got her job back. She almost drank all my reserves in one night!
If you could find a way to get all those corpses back in the ground while you're up there, I sure would appreciate that.\n\nI can't make a living if I can't get into the graveyard!
I thought I recognized you! You were right in the middle of those Imperial bastards. \n\nAnd, hey … didn't you also kill that hag back in Jackdaw Cove? By Stendarr's shield, I'm talking to a legend!
Thank you, my friend. For all you've done.\n\nBut it seems our hardship isn't over yet.
Hold a moment. What business have you in Bangkorai Garr—oh. A thousand pardons, I didn't recognize you. Welcome back, sir.
Follow your blood. It will lead you to Rahaja.\n\nPerhaps we will be kin one day.
You an archer? Nah, I bet you like that personal touch. Axes, right?  \n\nEither way, I've got a weapon for you!
<No new scouting missions are available.>
Our job will be to help Vanus with the portals. We'll need a lot of them to establish supply lines after we start conquering territory.
You must be the one Ram told us about. Let me look at you.\n\nYou have strong eyes. A strong soul, I'll bet.
I'm looking for work. Know anyone who needs a hauler? I'm real good at breaking down tents, packing them up, and hauling them where they need to be unpacked and pitched.\n\nAnd don't say carnival. I'm done with carnivals.
Don't just stand there—the Elder Scroll of Ghartok has been stolen! Help your comrades recover it!
I wish I could have stormed <<1>> myself, but I swore my strength to my thane's side. I must resort to indirect measures to protect her.
My husband and the others did what they thought was best. Who knew that dreadful Gavendien would go back on his word?
Have you come to join us for the final push, Lieutenant? We are all that's left of the King's Guard, but at least we'll take a few Orcs down with us.\n\nAs soon as we see an opening, we're charging into that breach down there.
<The wine's aroma makes your mouth water in anticipation.>
This one is glad you are with the Guild at this difficult time. Bear with us, adept.
Look around you. Does it look like we have time for idle chatter?
Don't worry. I'm not going to try to skip town or anything. If I wanted to do that, I'd have just spit in your eye and stabbed you in the stomach, and gone along my merry way.\n\nI'm coming … when I feel like it.
A new ruler for Shornhelm. This is a huge moment for Rivenspire.\n\nWe should all be honored to witness such a moment.
The High King actually named a single ruler for Shornhelm? Amazing! It's good to have a proper ruler on our throne again.
Time to crack open another jug of Ungorth. Only thing that makes this bearable.
The Fighters Guild is here to serve! You know how it is. Hah!
Please … more curative … I need more curative ….
Did you heal the injured?
You were the one? The one that helped the alchemist? Oh, thank you!\n\nMy wife hasn't been cured, but at least the plague won't continue to get worse as long as the suppressant holds out.
Greetings. Have you come to the Ashlands seeking glory and honor? The caverns of Stonefalls hold treasure. And danger. And death. \n\nAhem. Have you heard of them? The Armature? Emberflint?
Brave little scrib, do you know how to swim?
I'm glad you and Aerona didn't give up on me. I'm feeling much better. But Nilyne says her potion has only suppressed the plague, not cured it.\n\nIf you find a way to beat this plague, make sure you send word to us. And thanks for helping my town.
Friend! I'm so glad to see you again.\n\nI've been keeping up my end of the bargain—with Verandis' help, of course.
Erunor is young for a caretaker, it must be hard on his wife.
Nilyne's suppressant will hold the plague at bay. It has to.\n\nI really don't want to pack up and move my wagon again.
I'm glad we decided to come to the Serk. The town alchemist has been very helpful—even if she keeps trying to get me to drink sour milk tea. I never developed a taste for the stuff.
I protested against the bargain. I did not trust the salvation Shada promised.\n\nFor my troubles, Shada cursed me twice. I was forced to drink the water, but to remain conscious, watching as my people slowly went mad under Shada's influence.
Aetherian light take him! I was so certain I could best Nerien'eth this time. That I had strengthened my spells.\n\nIf you hadn't come back, we'd all be dead. Again.
Kelmen should have never confronted her alone. This Cassipia must pay for the blood spilled today!
I admit it. I didn't think our mission stood an Elf's chance in Orsinium of succeeding. But here we are!\n\nYour reputation is rightly deserved. And with any luck, those wards will hold for another thousand years.
Please. Hurry to Belkarth. I don't think you should keep the great warrior waiting any longer than is absolutely necessary.
<No new commissions are available at this time.>
Oh … you've made it? My friend. \n\nThe children are ready for supper, and my time is almost done. Do you see how strong they are? I will give them a strong start. They will do great things. Won't you, my loves?
I can't believe it. Not only did I leave all my clothes behind on the ship, but I left my comb too!\n\nI might just have to go back.
I don't know what to say. I respected Kurog's ideals, his vision … but all of that was built on sand.
Well, did you earn your pay today?
Kaoc! This shirt feels like fresh, warm mud. I am embarrassed that my mother asked you to perform such a petty errand, especially because it was my own fault.\n\nAll the same, I erect the spine of gratitude.
This whole business about being worthy is too tempting a challenge for the average Orc.\n\nI guess we'll need to figure out a way to keep everyone from trying on the Fist.
My request carries a heavy burden. Believe me, I know. But your actions will potentially save innocent lives and bolster the king's standing.\n\nDo not fail me, outsider, and I will make sure that you are greatly rewarded.
How can my heart hurt so much for someone I never knew?
You have done a great service for Malacath and his followers, outsider. Know that the Agra Crun will remember your actions.\n\nNow, go. And may your next battle be glorious.
Orcs, Redguards, and Bretons built this place. They buried their dead together.\n\nThey say a bond is formed on the battlefield, even among enemies. Perhaps both sides tired of death in the end.
I'll stay here and ward the doors so the cultists don't follow you.\n\nGo find the others and tell them about the danger facing the moot. Anyone could be a Vosh Rakh, which is going to make it hard to spot them before they strike. Go! I'll be fine.
So, I should probably say something about the Lost Barrow, but I really don't remember much about it.
My beloved and the forge-mother, everything they do is for the greater good of the Orsimer people. A few lives lost today will save countless thousands tomorrow.\n\nNow go. And I hope we never have to meet as enemies.
You made it! You do fine work. I can hear those Ogrim howling from here.
Clear us a path to the towers and we'll take care of the rest. I promise we'll get the Elf into position safely.\n\nWhether or not she can hit the target, well, that's a whole other question.
Have you had a chance to inspect the Morkul forge yet? I've seen more than a few masterpieces drawn from those coals. The Guild could use more weapons like that.
I'll use what resources I have to investigate the attack Orsinium's temple. As for our stronghold, that's a battle for another day. But I swear before the Furious One, Fharun shall be ours again. You can count on that!\n\nNow, where is Chief Bazrag?
Let's continue this fascinating discussion in the dining hall downstairs. I'll meet you there after I make apologies to my guests.\n\nAnd you better have proof to substantiate these wild claims or I might just have you flayed for ruining my good mood.
Enough talk! The time has come for action!\n\nGo check on Solgra while I see what I can do about rallying some aid from my remaining contacts.
Greetings to you!
Don't think I've seen you around. Or I could've! I was quite drunk yesterday.\n\nHello again, for the first time.
According to the priest, if the great seal fails, the necromancers will be free to wander the countryside. And if that happens, we'll all be in trouble!
I mean it, don't disturb Narahni's rest. And the upstairs rooms are off-limits to the likes of you.
The guildmaster is expecting you. Go on in.
It was nice to get to know you, Assassin. And I know it was your pleasure to get to know me.\n\nBe careful in there.
This is folly, all of it. But if I come along, perhaps half of us will survive our certain doom.\n\nI didn't think it was possible to think less of <<1>>, and here she finds a way.
I, ah, have something I should really go check on. If you'll excuse me.
I just hope the artifacts you recovered will be enough to convince our patrons to continue funding our troubled dig.
Why are you still here? When you're done, find <<1>> in <<c:2>>. She'll reward you.
Hello, partner. I'm happy to inform you I can pick a lock within fifteen seconds.\n\nAs long as nobody's watching.
I don't want to know the details. Believe me, if there was another way ….\n\nJust make sure the Pirate Queen dies. The fate of the Gold Coast depends on it.
My apprentice wasn't very good at pretending to be bait. She did hook you, though, so Raz supposes that's something.\n\nFinish your business and then we'll talk. Raz is sure we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
You're going to leave me alone in this hostel, aren't you? And without a weapon, I bet.\n\nWell, I guess I'll just trust the Commander and assume that I'll still be alive to celebrate with him after you return.
Please. Hurry to Belkarth. I don't think you should keep the great warrior waiting any longer than is absolutely necessary.
Your bravery does you credit. Fight well and return safe.
You came all the way up here? Even with the warnings? I hope you weren't hurt. I'd feel horrible.\n\nUsually people are too frightened to ever get this far! But still, do you need a bandage? Some tea? The whole ordeal must have been stressful.
The Red Exiles! They've gone mad! Please, you have to do something before they kill Seryn!
Naturally, Neramo's trying to renegotiate our delving fee. Unexpected circumstances, he says. I'll show him unexpected circumstances when I ram my quill up his arse!
You have no idea how thankful I am. That thing still haunts my nightmares!
I can't wait to dig in and see what secrets these ancient tomes contain!
Thank the Eight, you're alive! \n\nWe didn't know what would happen when we left. We hoped for the best, but feared the worst. It's so good to know you're safe—is Farwen with you?
You. I remember you. You were at Ald'ruhn. Some say you're a friend to the clans.\n\nDo you wish to prove it?
The slavers, they're coming back! They're going to punish us severely for this.
Do mind the guar! \n\nIsn't country life grand? It's like I'm right back at home in Cyrodiil. Aside from the giant fungi and adorable lizard chickens, of course.
Baar Dau is falling and Red Mountain erupts, but Lord Vivec will still protect.
What a singular honor! I've never been invited to a Living God's soiree before!\n\nI'm just glad I was able to get all of the webs off my man-servant. I'd hate for him to sully my reputation by making a bad impression.
I had no idea you were in Lord Vivec's good graces! Perhaps you could put in a good word for me? I'm currently in negotiations with House Redoran about rebuilding a settlement. And have no fear, I'll keep my end of the bargain with the Ashlanders.
You're not part of the Mages Guild, are you? Perhaps you would like to be?
So that's it? We're citizens now? Wonderful! I can't wait to get started on our next adventure!
Thank you, my friend. My old bones aren't up to another adventure, but I owe it to Kamid's mother to do whatever I can to keep him safe.\n\nThe Grand Prognosticator spits out fortunes the way a sawmill spits out lumber—all the same until one isn't.
I can't believe Palbatan revealed the location. Now we can show my people that the Prognosticator isn't infallible. That we can forge our own destinies.\n\nI'll meet you near the wrecked caravan and we can figure out how to deal with Gear Grinder.
I—I can't breathe … I don't breathe. Instead, I whir and click. It's not so different.
By the word of Seht, I am bound.\n\nAwaiting task input. Vocal commands accepted. Please select command one, two, or three.
I know this wasn't easy. While I disagree with your decision, I understand why you made it. I only hope Emile and the Sapiarchs can look past this sordid affair.\n\nAt least Emile will go free. I hope he can make peace with that.
If I ever get my hands on that mage, I'll rip her to shreds! How dare she ruin our audition like that!
Got nothing else for you, mate. I'd point you in the direction of some other haunted tomb, but mercifully I don't know any others. I hope to keep it that way.
This must be the place. I wonder where the old man hid the tower crystal?
The two ogres ahead seem to be the clan leaders. We'll need to defeat them in order to continue on. No easy task, I'm sure. They look to be formidable foes.\n\nI'd advise you to keep your distance, if possible. I'd hate for anyone to become infected.
You'll find Sotha Sil in his study on the upper levels of Ceporah Tower.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll make sure Valsirenn and the Golden Knight see the Psijic healers. I think we'll need them at their best before too long.
I couldn't possibly speak to you until the important council meeting has wrapped up. I'm completely inundated with the business of Summerset until the meeting comes to an end.\n\nCome back later and we can conclude our business then.
Why does my muse elude me? I can't channel my inner Nord. If this Ambassador Rigurt can't aid me, I'm afraid we'll have to cancel tonight's performance.
All I have to do is become such a great artist that no one will dare question my relationship with Manacar. And how could I not succeed, with such a motivation?
Does this one regret leaving Elsweyr and making the journey to Summerset? No. For Jone and Jode watch over me and bless me with health and good fortune!\n\nHow can Urjurra help you, friend?
Are you sure this Khajiit is trustworthy? I've read "The Adventures of Kazurr Graystripes," you know. He was such a scoundrel!
If you're not willing to help, this one suggests you leave. There are darker forces in this cave than mutinying smugglers. Nubani will sail out of Karnwasten as soon as she can.\n\nAnd let Renzir know she will find him soon.
It's good to see you alive and well. Word has already spread about your daring exploits within the Crystal Tower. It's still a little hard to believe, truth be told.\n\nOf course, there's so much left to do. I already have a list as long as my arm.
Did you hear that? Something moving just beyond the light of the campfire. By the Divines, its cold out here!
Thank the Divines! You aren't one of the monks. Please, let me out of here!
You've done what my order could not. Vykosa has fallen, and Tamriel is safe from her malicious intent. The Moon Hunter Pack shall be no more.
It was a hard battle, but Z'Maja has been defeated. \n\nWe may not have been able to save Cloudrest, but there was no telling what devastation she had planned for the rest of Summerset. You've done this Isle a great service.
Do our ancestors still smile upon us? Now that our borders have been taken? Now that we've tainted our homeland with unworthy souls?\n\nAre we still worthy of Summerset …?
Before you ask, the gates of Cloudrest are still barred from visitors. The city is currently being rebuilt. Only those authorized to help with construction efforts can enter.
That's the only message I have for you. I'm sure the Relicmaster will be able to tell you more.
Don't mind me, I'm just thinking of something to carve on this pillar. It needs to be … evocative. Grandiose!\n\nOh, oh! "Harik was here." Yeah, that's perfect.
My bonding partner is very pleasing, wouldn't you agree? She leads me like a gentle current to a place of great happiness.
My betrothed has nice adornments. They will be suitable trophies.
So much death …. Filthy ojels!\n\nOne mural remains. Find it. Go!
A word of advice, if I may.\n\nIf you plan to negotiate with Captain Jimila, don't underestimate her. She's always aboveboard and doesn't cheat, but she can be as slippery as a harbor eel. She won't always let you know what's written between the lines.
Sithis has spared us for another day. I will greet every dawn as if it is my last.
Vampy-bastards can't make a sandwich to spare their lives—not that I would—meats all dry! Got to get my strength up for the bashing to come!\n\nSoon those toothy gits will learn just what this Bosmer is made of. Fists!
The birth of a new tribe! What a marvelous thing to witness.\n\nI could write a volume on all that I've seen today. But you know … I think I will keep this moment, just for me. Thank you, my friend. For everything.
I did not think these old eyes would ever see something so grand. The birth of a new tribe and new life for a sleeping Hist.\n\nYou have done very well, beeko. Very well indeed.
My heart soars at your accomplishments, ojel. And at what you have done for the Dead-Water tribe.\n\nI raise the spine of respect in your direction, despite your strange and abhorrent ways.
Do I have the look of one who wishes to talk? Begone.
Be careful, yes? This Remnant may still be dangerous.
Something else, friend? This one has told you all he knows of Khunzar-ri and the Demon. Later, Azargo will recite the Poem of Rajhin in Rimmen, but it is long, repetitive, and frankly, not very good.
Because of your help, our companions live.\n\nStill, there is much to do before they are well enough to travel. But do not worry, Iokkas and I will tend to their needs.
I need to return to Elsweyr and explain all this to Gharesh-ri. It is not a conversation I look forward to.\n\nPerhaps the annoying old wizard will accompany me. It would serve him right to take the brunt of the Speaker of the Mane's displeasure.
Don't dawdle, now! The Proof of Wisdom awaits you back in Hakoshae.
Yushiha hoped she would see you again, walker. She very nearly didn't. The Moon Gate was a costly victory.
We may have sundered and redeemed Arum-Khal, but his thralls remain. Ushering those spirits back to Oblivion will keep me busy for some time.\n\nAs for you, you have Azura's eye now. She'll guide you to glory. You need only listen.
Seems that duty calls, thank the Moons. Raz does not know if he would have survived another day with his oh-so-beloved family.\n\nStill, he can at least stay for one more meal.
J'dathal was curious as to why his daughters were so distraught when Raz first left. Now this one starts to paint the picture, yes?
Go on. Get to the Desert Wind Adeptorium and see what Euraxia wants with the adepts. Remember, it's west of here. And if the main entrance is blocked, look for another way in.\n\nI need another moment to catch my breath, then I'll return to Riverhold.
Thank you for stopping, walker.\n\nYou seem to be a traveler of some strength, no? Strong enough to help save this one's companions? They are trapped in the nearby oasis, surrounded by walking corpses and deadly fumes.
Dusk mushrooms are as rare as they are delicious! I envy the old loremaster. If only someone cared enough to bring me such tasty morsels.
Would you like to hear the words of our beginnings?
I'm staying far away from the Weeping Scar. I'd sooner risk Euraxia's dungeons than be made a meal of.
Did you hear? Rimmen belongs to the Khajiit again. And Queen Khamira lives! Still, this one suspects that much remains to be done.
Did you hear? They killed a Dragon in Riverhold! A Dragon!
Look what we found, walker! Za'ji has to say, the Dragonguard certainly has style. Though this one did decide to make a few alterations.\n\nNow, what's our next move? What does our Dragon friend have up his scaly sleeve?
Oh, ah. Hello. \n\nZa'ji and I found these uniforms and couldn't resist trying them on. We're forming a new Dragonguard order, right? We thought we should look the part. I hope that's not a problem.
When a Dragonguard dies, we say a prayer. May your flame burn eternal.\n\nIt's a promise to honor them, a desire for their legacy to live on. And it's an oath that we uphold, to never forget those who came before. An oath I will always honor.
From pit fighter to pirate to honored by the queen of Rimmen! Caska can barely contain her excitement!\n\nIf you ever need my help, walker, don't hesitate to ask.
Salutations! Shazar sees that S'rendarr smiles upon your struggles! Such a ceremonious series of circumstances this one cannot summon from memory!\n\nShazar is grateful to have showered before such a celebration.
That is what happens to those who defy Laatvulon. He kills them then forces their corpse to do his bidding.\n\nPahklok. What shameful arrogance.
You really should be going, cerum. Our quarry, no matter how fierce, doesn't last forever.
They say the New Moon Cult has been dashed asunder. Their leader dead, and the Dragon destroyed. It will not restore the master's razed property, but it may offer him some comfort.\n\nWhich is more than I can say for this pitiful attempt at a campfire.
This one has already said more than is wise. Please go now.
I met a clever woman who lives in the bog near Morthal. Old Mjolen's a dying breed among the Nords, a practitioner of the old magic. The locals both admire and fear her.\n\nIf anyone can help me untangle the coven's ritual, it's her.
I've come to the conclusion that anything is possible where magic is concerned.\n\nI'm going to look around with Lyris, then return to Old Mjolen to finish studying the witch pike residue. Maybe that will help me understand how the ritual works.
Reachmen from the west, pact from the east, monsters from below! This city's cursed!
You can take that boat to the Frostbite's hideaway on the Frozen Coast. It's a ramshackle dump. Shacks and tents on shifting ice floes. There's no telling where Nelfthea will be. You'll have to search. Don't spare any raiders who get in your way.
Raynor and I have been in our fair share of impossible situations. But this one? It definitely beats them all, at least when it comes to strangeness. And that's saying a lot when it comes to Dwarven ruins. \n\nThey're usually strange to start.
Mazog was foolish to stand up to the chief. She paid the price for disobedience.
Safe travels. And if you ever see Narsis again, be sure to give him a firm kick in the shin for me.
Bradan can speak to the mood of the Ghostsong clan. Tell him what you told me. I'm sure he'll help us get a meeting with my sister. He's a werewolf, mind you, but I've never had a truer friend.\n\nLook for him at Hroldan Ring. I'll meet you there.
That was a heartening display. The Reachfolk are often dismissed as savage and beastly, but they have a strong sense of honor. I know that all too well.
That look on your face. I know curiosity when I see it. Very well. I can spare a few more moments before sending you off on your task.\n\nWhat does the outsider in Ard Caddach's court wish to know?
Lady Belain's designs be damned. We must put a stop to this for the sake of my clan. Maybe for the sake of the entire world.
Do you suppose Eeze ever tires of dancing, Verandis? The girl enjoys frolicking in that fountain almost as much as she enjoys warm blood.
Begone from here, outsider. I don't want your pity.\n\nI will take my punishment. If the chief demands the Blood Price, then I will pay.
You again. Need something else I could explain for you? More lessons in politeness? Perhaps a demonstration on how to wipe your arse?
It's good to see you once more, friend! I can barely believe the same outsider who helped me was involved in such important work! To see everyone who's been brought here by your deeds is inspiring. And it's good to see Madearn and Drisene.
That dolt Faorin led us into a slaughter, but I guess Medone and you managed to lead us out. The Hillhunters are not finished yet.
I should return to the Dark Heart soon. I grow weary if I'm away from it for too long. Plus, I need no additional reasons to nod off as I trudge through the Nighthollow Testament.\n\nUntil next time, my friend.
I would never turn away anyone in need. We will protect the Ambitions for as long as we can, yet I fear my legionnaires will not be able to hold off Vandacia's forces should they attack.\n\nGo to the Temple of Dibella when you're ready to talk to them.
Salvitto's Estate is north of Gideon, near Blackwood Lake. I'll meet you there. I want to make a quick stop to check on the twins and let Governor Keshu know what we discovered. And to tell her where we're going.\n\nYou know, just in case.
I'll make sure Salvitto gets to Gideon. Turn him over to Governor Keshu. Then I'll meet you in Leyawiin.
Out here by the water's safest, if you ask me. Wide open, creaky boardwalks, no surprises.\n\nNow go on. Bother those strange Elves if you must bother somebody.
I was out on a hunt when Naxhosa attacked. Now I am ready to return the favor and avenge those that we lost.
I'm actually glad you found us. I didn't want to leave without an explanation, but I'm afraid that Calia doesn't have a lot of time.
You have my gratitude. Without your help, I would never have discovered how to quell the volcanic vents. Perhaps in time, I will puzzle out how exactly they became active again in the first place. But for now, I am content to merely thwart disaster.
It seems you have done well, little mortal. I hear you killed Mehrunes Dagon's high priest and stopped the planes from merging.\n\nI find you to be … interesting. I will remember that the next time I require the assistance of a mortal agent.
You have my sincerest thanks. Nocturnal will surely smile upon us both today for helping to save her loyal servants. \n\nShadows cloak your way, friend.
Seems this portal leads to Blackwood—on the southern border of Cyrodiil. I read an intelligence report about a series of high-profile murders with links to the region. Daedric mischief, too.\n\nA warrior like you could do some real good there.
I understand that Mehrunes Dagon failed to learn his lesson the first time. So be it. I am nothing if not a patient teacher.
Ah, dearest mortal. Your companions are already upstairs. As much as I would love to nuzzle the secrets right out of you, Lyranth looked very insistent. You shouldn't keep her waiting.
Devastator, you honor me. How can a lowly acolyte serve you?
That man. Sombren. He seems familiar … but why did he destroy the emperors? There was so much more I wanted to ask. Especially of Moricar.\n\nI … I can't quite bring myself to call him father. But what Moricar said. Is it true? Am I an Ambition?
I hoped to punish the Waking Flame for their offenses against my Kyn, but I cannot breach this ward. You must mete out vengeance for me, mortal. Do not disappoint me.\n\nAnd try not to die in Deadlight. We still need to deal with Valkynaz Nokvroz.
Come on, we have to move! The Anchorite and Calia are in trouble!
What a battle! Glorious! Blood drenches the ground of Destruction's Solace and Mehrunes Dagon's defeat shudders throughout the realm!\n\nTo witness your triumph was my greatest honor, master!
Repulsive temper carried existence departure. Orbs fastened to no sincerity. Extremity direction unpleasant.\n\nAbility seeks higher. You. Did. Job. Well. Attention suspected great own.
You have proven yourself in realms where most mortals fear to tread.\n\nI will remember your name, mortal. Vame of the Bladebearers would be honored to fight by your side.
Za'ji can hardly wait to see the Pounce newly decked and polished! He will take you out for the maiden voyage, if you desire!\n\nPerhaps she will be up to chasing these Sea Elves and swatting their noses for the insult … and those lodestones.
The Constrictions are completed. Your bones are surprisingly resilient, Nirnling. Now, leave me.
My mistress, the Dread Lady, gone? And she didn't take me with her? What did I do to displease her? More importantly, what did you do to make her leave? This is all your fault! It has to be!\n\nOr maybe this is a test? Go away. I need to ponder.
Mehrunes Dagon, defeated by mortals! I did not think such a thing was possible.\n\nMadam Whim seems pleased. Perhaps that will make my existence under her more bearable.
So, my erstwhile colleague banishes Dagon himself. I must admit I'm impressed. I know only two people who've accomplished the same, and they are worshiped as gods.\n\nJust don't let the victory go to your head. No one likes a conceited braggart.
I'm all right. Fortunately Lady Arabelle was close at hand to protect me from those terrorists. And the rest of the guests managed to retreat into the castle safely.\n\nI suggest you consult with Lady Arabelle as to how we respond to this outrage.
Best of luck finding your friend. A rogue order of knights causing havoc across the island is bad enough, but this sounds worse than I imagined. A dark storm gathers over High Isle.\n\nI will warn my circle and ask them to be on guard.
You don't look like a salvager. Come to join up with those so-called knights who've been hanging around, did you?\n\nFeh. I'd rather go hungry than swear myself to the likes of them.
We have to find Valessea. Just keep an eye out for any of those Ascendant Order bruisers.
Don't think I'm not grateful that you saved my skin. I am. Just owing my life to strangers when my own brother stood by and watched is the definition of galling!
There is no need for you to linger here. Go track down your associate before he delivers another trap into someone's unwitting hands.\n\nI'll make sure the Skald-King gets this medallion. The Society of the Steadfast need not worry.
Good fortune, wherever your adventures take you!
House Mornard will hear about what happened here. The good and bad both. \n\nDruids turning the living into coral fodder? A fight between mortal life and nature? There's something strange happening here, but it's beyond my comprehension.
It's not in my nature to give up my own freedom, and I'm not. Piracy isn't the only life out here.\n\nVeslyn and her captain won't see trouble from us and we'll fight by their side. We swear it, on the constancy of the tides.
Thank you for helping Rigurt to sort out this mess he made. The sooner we can all forget about last night's misadventures, the better.\n\nI really don't want any of my colleagues to find out I got arrested.
Thank you for finding me out in the Shoals. Don't worry, once I get some mead in my belly I'll be as right as rain.\n\nI only hope some of my other crewmates made it to shore.
Put on that trusty outfit before you head inside. If you get caught, we never had this conversation. Understand? Good.
Bye bye. I … I'm a just take a nap here.
I apologize for my tardiness, but the work of an arch-magister never ends. I saw Lady Arabelle leave. Pity. I was hoping to speak with her.\n\nAnyway, the Mages Guild decided I would represent them in the upcoming peace talks. You have my invitation?
Ah, it's you! Please, you've got to help Miss Aurelia! She was snatched by a nasty looking brigand. One of the children ran up to tell me!\n\nIf you hurry, they can't be too far. Apparently she was giving them quite a hard time.
Perhaps I can convince one or more of the knightly orders to join us. The Order of the Albatross is usually willing to leap into a fray.\n\nAh, I implore you to delay until I can coordinate our forces. You cannot take on the Ascendant Order alone!
I'm not usually one to be overly cautious, but even I have enough sense to know all that volcano business doesn't bode well for Gonfalon Bay. Or anyone.
Processed prisoners, I've seen all kinds. Some beg and plead. Others cry like babes dragged from their mothers' breasts. Others get angry, offer gold, make threats.\n\nIt would be sad if I didn't find it so amusing.
Hey, good-looking! Did you miss me?
No time to talk, stranger. The castle's docks are as busy as I've ever seen them. And the duchess's flagship is moored out in the bay, too.
Oh, this makes no sense at all. Shorebirds of the Systres should be shelved right here. Who in the world would have moved it?
Nothing is ever dull when you're around, my friend. You did good, five-claw. Very good. Now talk to Lady Arabelle so we can figure out how to proceed with the peace talks.\n\nI wonder what we'll tell people about Lord Bacaro.
Don't get too used to seeing me around, mercenary. The lordling asked me to remain a little longer and I'm still waiting on the rest of my pay.\n\nAfter that? Back to the open waters. Maybe we'll cross currents again at some point. The sea only knows.
Yves keeps my debt close to his chest. My claws are blunted by all this idle waiting. Does he think I'm foolish enough to play at these tables and prolong my time?
You … you're like me, aren't you? You've got a certain … passion for life, one might say.
You're back in one piece! That's good. Turns out I still have a lot more research to do about regenerative properties. \n\nBut thank you for the help!
Don't stop to talk to me, partner. There are way more important people at this affair that want your attention!
The false king awakened and unleashed the spirit of the mountain. He draws upon its power. Soon, nothing will be able to stop the eruption.\n\nWe must hurry.
I assume you'll be heading back to High Isle now? Do give Lady Arabelle my regards and assure her that House Mornard stands ready should the Ascendant Lord and his so-called knights emerge from hiding.\n\nKnights, bah! Cowards, the lot of them.
You have the ring? Good. Please bring it to Frelene. I'm sure you'll find her in Vastyr. Tell her of my fate, but don't worry her overmuch. I want her to know that I'm not suffering. \n\nThank you, my friend. You can't know how much this means.
To get a piece of Jocien back after nearly twenty years … it's like seeing his face again. It's almost as if he's here with me.\n\nI never understood his pull to the sea. But perhaps this is what he meant by its endless mysteries and surprises.
Sea Elves, druids, a smoldering volcano … what is happening on our beloved island?\n\nWhy, I have half a mind to move back to Wayrest!
Surely the Eight sent you to save us. Me, my daughter, we owe you our lives. \n\nDo you always go to such great lengths to help people you don't even know?
Sounds like you've got an even livelier party than usual in there.
It seems you wound up saving me twice. \n\nI wish I knew a proper way to express my level of gratitude.
Please, take my sword to Princess Mira at her crypt.\n\nI pray she forgives me. I cannot rest until she does.
The Stonechewers' breeding stock has been badly depleted by this foolish conflict. Leave me alone to contemplate this tragedy in solemn silence.
It's time!
I expect the beetles to clear out soon and then we can get back to work.\n\nI'm never overjoyed to get back to work, but I am grateful to fulfill my father's dying wish.
Are you ready for your next lesson?
Thanks, stranger. \n\nIf you find any survivors, tell them help will soon be on its way.
This one would speak with you for a moment, walker. \n\nYou might be interested in an opportunity to earn some gold by helping someone in need?
The guards are looking rather anxious. Something's changed, hasn't it? And for the better. \n\nI think we might live through this.
I'm acting on orders directly from Sir Hughes. If he wants to make an exception, he'll let me know in due time.\n\nUntil then, the envoy stays out!
A crime was committed and the price had to be paid. I wish it could have been otherwise, but I have done my duty as you chose.
Was that a fight I heard? Looks like you didn't need any help.\n\nLeveque's likely still up there. Go get him.
By the Eight! He killed them. Get in there and destroy the Duke. I'll make sure he doesn't get past you. Go!
Did I hear you harassing my workers? Ohama says she sent you to look for a thief among them.\n\nI'm not sure I believe her story, but I'm willing to hear her out.
Well, at least I can say that Sarvith's spells are consistent. They never fail to fail.
It's awful out there. I hate war. I just hate it!\n\nAnd I want my mother. Why isn't she back yet? I want to go home!
I know her Majesty would appreciate if you gave these matters the highest priority. After you've completed your investigation, come speak to the queen at the Chapel of Saint Pelin. \n\nIf there are problems, she should know as soon as possible.
We're going to get rid of the Red Rooks, aren't we?
That's not right. Something strange is going on in this town! You've seen it, haven't you?\n\nThey just took Draven away for their "initiation." It's like some kind of cult!
Well, that last lizard didn't race so well.\n\nSpeak to <<1>> again. She might know how to help your lizard.
Glenumbra is pretty, like Valenwood without the jungles … or torchbugs. And all the trees are wrong. Actually, it's nothing like Valenwood. \n\nPretty, though.
The Fell's Brigade will defend this town! You have my word on that.
Normally I hate it when he yanks me around the room with those little spells. But I've never been more grateful to him. Or to you, traveler.
You're back! Do you have the antidote?
Thanks for helping me out of that spot of trouble. I'll follow you to the monastery and help protect the Tear.
The warm-blood is skillful and cunning.
I still can't figure out why that Urano fellow kept asking to buy our lumber. He kept saying, "If you sold it to me, how long until you could leave town?"
Boril will send me away. I can't blame him. \n\nI'm grateful he didn't tell the workers what I did.
Did you recover our stolen relics?
You've got both of the essences? Quickly, make your way to <<1>>. She must be ready to perform the ritual by now.
The Lion Guard is in your debt, stranger. \n\nI am in your debt.
The cave's smack in the middle of <<1>>. The Dominion's locked it tighter than a High Elf's fundament. Might have to knock a few heads to get past them.
I've betrayed everyone. I've betrayed the entire Pact.
Thank you for doing what my brothers and I could not.
The Fang crawled into my mind! What have I done? I can't stop it from gnawing my thoughts.\n\nHelp me!
Have you seen <<1>>? Our scouts spotted the Dominion's main force!
Tell Dajaheel what we've learned. I'll look for one of the ritual sites.
Father will know what to do. Grandad taught him everything he knew about surviving in the Rift.
Our family is back together. I can never thank you enough.
Please, kill it quickly.
You saved Charadin. Bless you!
Greetings. What brings you to my pier in the middle of this disaster?
I'll coordinate my tale with Spinners Einrel and Caerllin. Meanwhile, you must get to the Green Lady!\n\nWe'll take care of getting the Silvenar inside the city. A fitting climax to a terrifying tale.
We should leave this place. Let the forest have it.
You will swim in the waters of victory. I smell it.
Told you something bad was going to happen.\n\nI didn't want you to walk into this trap alone. So I followed you. Good thing, too.
We're going to get the fort up and running again. My scouts report that there are still Stormfist troops in the area.
May the waters protect you. You will succeed.\n\nRemember, not all foes must be fought. Use your stealth and your wits to avoid fights. Save your strength for the true enemy, Sinmur.
<This Dark Elf woman wears Worm Cultist garb. From the claw marks, it appears she was mauled to death by sabre cats. A look through her pack reveals a blood-stained journal.>
The invaders crossed the bridge! They've taken over the entire town!
The camp's not far from here. I doubt the cultists will simply let you take one.\n\nThey never dared enter Treehenge before. I wonder what changed?
This time we should burn that giant to ashes. And then scatter the ashes to the winds.\n\nHave you spoken with Vigrod yet?
Telenger is amazing, isn't he? I'd do anything to get his recommendation.
There you are. Vigrod wants to talk to you, right away.
Enough! I'm no match for an Ebonheart brute.
Word of advice, friend. Never trust a necromancer.\n\nIf you absolutely have to, think hard, and then walk the other way.
Dark rumors in town. Too many dark rumors.
It's so cold. Can barely move. Never get out of here.\n\nNot sure I want to.
Where am I? What happened?
<The statue looks very lifelike.>
The finest weapons in all the Dominion. Forged right here in Mathiisen. \n\nHot off the anvil. If you will.
Those bugs are in the hay. All over the place. Go get them!
Managed to bag my Ranger! And Cariel here has been telling me about your exploits.
I'm sorry, I was just speaking with the High Kinlady. And now you've interrupted us. Excuse us, please?
So. Did you finish your tour of our little school?
Let's get this dispatch back to Aldcroft.
You're a full member now. And you're in luck. The Veiled Queen herself will be speaking to the cause.
We've retaken the Cove! By Mara! \n\nOw.
I'm here from Firsthold to inspect the weapons. High Kinsman Rilis only wants the best armaments for the First Auridon Marines.
Did you find him?
Well done. Very well done!
You have freed not only my soul, but the souls of all the students caught in my husband's attack.\n\nYour actions right a wrong that was long overdue.
What do you say, outlander? Do you still stand with <<1>> Stronghold?
You're lucky Bloodthirster is not competing. Your pathetic beast would not survive!
The stronghold survived because of your help. We won't forget this.
Too many elves! One will kill Byz, he knows it!
What did Shazah say? Are we going somewhere?
This is no place for the living. Begone!
The Hound is my concern, and mine alone. Yet, I just can't leave the Silvenar in danger.\n\nWhen will he leave me be?
That … that was terrifying! I was afraid I'd be stuck in that body forever! Curse you!
I can't face <<1>> without our goods.
You return with treasures and a ghost. You have been busy.
If you ever get your hands on more of those fantastic Nord garments, I'd be happy to buy them from you.
Less wounded than usual. I'd say we definitely have the ogres on the run now.
This one overheard. He is called Razum-dar, and on behalf of Queen Ayrenn, he thanks you.
This bodes well. With the beach clear we can take the fight to our enemy.
Enter Warcaller Targoth's memories. Witness my fate.
Before I return this journal to Guifford, I must try to find a way to stop Faolchu. His werewolves can't be allowed to continue their attacks. My brother barely survived his encounter with the creatures.
Juluda feels so alive! Hah! Bring on more of those Colovian bastards!
All that trouble for a hunk of red rock. I hope this is all worth it.
I assume my family wasn't especially pleased with an outsider prying into our affairs. \n\nRemember, it was your idea.
You made the right decision. Our homeland is safer with that artifact than without it.
So many names. So many faces. Such terrible understanding.
Life is never certain. I take a torchbug, attach it to my hook, which ends its life, and hopefully, that of a fish as well.\n\nNothing's biting, though. Haven't been for days. It's a sign.
Stop! You have no idea what you're doing. Those relics are the property of the Night Mother.\n\nWe felt their emanations the moment you removed them from their resting places, thief. Give them to me or pay the price.
My lesser minions barely slowed you down. I'm impressed. But you're too late. I've already begun the ritual. Once it ends, my corruption will spread throughout Xal Ithix!
<The statue holds the Gem of Endurance.>
What are you waiting for? Stop King Renwic before he destroys us!
Go away.
Thanks again. Not getting turned into a zombie is the second best thing to happen to me all day!
Yes, strike down the old Elf. His apprentice isn't my size, but she has possibilities.
Our scouts say the Hollow have stopped fighting. Some have crumbled into dust. Others have simply wandered off.\n\nI trust this means you destroyed the Watchman?
My brothers and sisters in the Guildhall do not understand why we keep our swords sheathed in the face of the Ra-Netu. It is difficult. But it is a needful discipline, good for fighters such as we.
Well, that was invigorating! I love killing Daedra in the morning!
We need trained warriors out on the battlefields, so hurry up.
So soon you've learned all there is to know about siege engines?
You have your orders. Move along.
If you're not going to deliver those to Bugbesh, I'll take them back.
I think you have a fight you need to finish first.
Too weak to move ….
Your bravery and spirit impresses even Khali. Truly you are the Hallowed. Shazah and I are lucky to have you at our side.
What's this?
Look. Buy. Move on.
Istah thumped me for "public drunkenness" once. I say, whats the point of private drunkenness? Those're the folks with real problems, right? Right?
I'd probably be a in stew if it hadn't been for you. Thank you.
I never thought that nightmare was going to end. Thank you for helping us.
You were a worthy opponent in the Orchard. I'm almost disappointed that we must now fight alongside instead of against each other.\n\nStill, the Crimson-Matron has sent me to honor your agreement, and I shall not fail you.
This one will be the next champion. Stay out of my way if you don't like the sight of blood. Especially your own.
No end to these winged rats. Not that I'm complaining! Every feather's worth a fortune in gold to us now!\n\nYou one of the magistrate's charges? I'm only shooting the ones in town, don't worry.
Well, it is good you took the lid off when you did. It was getting stuffy in there.
Fill this poisoned cup with our enemies' blood, sister. All of the Alik'r watches you. May Tava speed your passage.
True honor need not be named, sister. May your blade never go thirsty while these fiends still draw breath.
You're back! Did you find everything?
It seems the necromancer Alasan underestimated you … I was hiding outside the lighthouse.\n\nAfter you disrupted the ritual, I went in and found Alasan's notes. I think I know where the Withered Hand has taken the third Ansei Ward.
The pieces are almost all in place.\n\nWe can move against Molag Bal whenever you want. Attack now or gather more forces. The choice is yours.
Now to journey to Malabal Tor, another land this one has never seen.
Indaenir's in there. I hope whatever luck guided you at the Pass watches over you now.
I have not seen Peruz since his final blessing. He did not even return to claim his bundle. He simply walked into the desert and disappeared. I hope it was not something I said.
Good luck on the road. And come back some time, you hear?
Do not fear, Nielas. We will make it back safely. Fanrel … Fanrel will be fine without us.
A troupe of valiant warriors. An army, with claws and swords and spears. This is what was sent for and for what Shimsamu awaits. We must hold strong, but without such aid, Dune is lost, no?
Those damned harpies made off with another of my ponies. By Saint Alessia, another week of this and I'll be walking back to Chorrol barefoot.
Damn that Molag Bal!
Those cultists have certainly made a mess of things, Anil-do has seen. If Anil-do had more five-clawed walkers at his back, Do'Krin could be set aright, and things much better.
It's the big winner! After a race like that, a body like yours has got to have a massive appetite. What say you slide me some of your winnings?
My poor Sayeed. He had no chance.
If Raz had known you would do so well, he would have scrounged you a nicer reward. Apologies. The Mistral armory is not what it once was.
Learn to control your anger and use it to fuel your most powerful attacks! So ends today's lesson. But then, you aren't in the guild yet.
Every town can benefit from the Fighters Guild. Crosswych is no different. You looking to join up and make your mark?
My heart lightens to see you again, friend. How did you fare?
You're alive! Does that mean—did you kill the troll?
I do not look forward to running through the sewers. There's a smell you can taste.
Erunor? Where is he? He's not coming, is he?
Lots of arguing in the tribe. I don't like that kind of thing.
Oh, yes, of course the Khajiit destroyed the plant. He's been working for them for ages, smuggling in magical powders through his cart and mixing them into our drinks. That's why I only drink water I've distilled myself.
Yeah, I heard. Gargak's not dead, that's great. You did good.\n\nSomeone should filthy his well, show him what it's like.
Do whatever you need to do. My brother and I will make sure nothing gets through here.\n\nWe might even be able to test some of Raynor's newest prototypes. That's always good for a laugh!
You've brought Lyris back! And largely intact, from the look of her.
Our orders were to protect the Mages Guild in their excavation, so you'll have to see to your own defense. We're spread too thin to do anything but guard this camp.
The priestess will set you straight. Mara's blessings be upon you.
One portal to the gates of Evermore right here for you. \n\nGood luck. From what I've heard, you're going to need it.
Give me one good reason I shouldn't march over there and take her head off.\n\nGo on, I'll wait.
Blessings of Tava be upon you. The magistrate of Bergama sent me hence to explore trade opportunities. \n\nAlas, it seems the people of Evermore have nothing to trade but trouble.
You're no Reachman. Stendarr's finally seen it fit to grant me a little mercy.
If you're going to finish Isabeth's work, be careful. She's very resourceful, for a city dweller. If the Dark Witnesses have her, they could easily grab you as well.
I shudder to call any arena more civilized, but this notion of matches being to the death … well, it is concerning. I could live without an arm or leg or eye, but I cannot live without my head!\n\nStill, though, the notion remains tempting.
I fear that Montclair will have a surprise or two waiting for us within the Doomcrag. I suddenly have the feeling that bringing an army up here was a terrible mistake.
The fire warms us when we're cold, but burns us when we're close. No matter how much you feed it, its hunger never ends.\n\nThe fire is sublime.
I need your help!\n\nThese blithering idiots are talking about selling us off into slavery!
Spare some food for an old coin?
I hope you do not intend to sojourn south, wayfarer. The situation is even worse there, I assure you.
Anything else?
Aha! My mercenary friend. Seeing you does me good, but the look on <<1>>'s face, aheh. A price beyond measure.
By the look of things, you're probably one of the ones fighting the Reachmen. That's good.\n\nWe don't have dissimilar goals, but remember: That doesn't make us friends.
I've been thinking of Nedras a lot recently. I keep thinking I'll see him come through my door, hear his voice. But never again.
My notes? I can't believe it! I thought I'd lost these for good.
Blacksap, Dominion? Who are we following now?
I knew you'd be back. I also know Naruk is dead. Thank you. Yet again, you've stopped a threat to the city and the Covenant.
<There's a new notice on the Warfront board.>
<There's a new notice posted to the Battle board.>
I've seen enough desert to last a lifetime. Can't wait to get back to the woods, with or without <<1>>.
I thought I was dead. Pieces of my life: family, friends … adventures, regrets. I could see it all. \n\nI can't even begin to tell you how thankful I am you got me out of there.
May Auri-El grant us the wisdom to reconsider our individual desires and concur on a halfway-state that best fits all Dominion peoples here in Elden Root.\n\nThis is not a time for strength, or certainty, but a measure of social kinship.
You interested in a drink? We have plenty to go around, considering the carnival is more or less shut down.
Let me know if you hear of any packing and unpacking jobs, would you?
You've been stumbling all over Redfur like a mead-soaked goat. Is there a party somewhere I missed? There had better not be.\n\nI hate missing parties.
You may not believe this, but that wasn't how I wanted our reunion to play out. But laws were broken. People died. I can't ignore our laws.\n\nNot even to save my son.
We are near Fallowstone Hall, hallowed home of the Companions. I would show you around, but this is not your place.
My friend! How good to see you again! Did you give the Hagraven a proper thrashing? And did you happen to find my wife's mace?\n\nTell me all is well and we'll drink to our good fortune!
Thrice-blasted nobles! Their coffers keep the kingdom running, but at the first sign of trouble ….
Have you brought me a sweet? I love sweets.
Yes? It's nice to see you again, of course, but I am kind of in the middle of something here.
You keep coming back to talk to me. If you're trying to get my attention, you're going to have to do better than that.
We've done nothing to them! Why do they attack us?
<<1>> thought Marbruk was a brand new city, but it is very popular already! Even the royalty visit.
I'd only finished the first trial when the betrayer struck, but it stands to reason that he's in the most secure part of the school—the cavern at the end of the final trial.\n\nYou'll need to complete the trials in order to avenge us.
My word, Queen Ayrenn, visiting Marbruk! A pity the streets hadn't been cleaned up before her arrival.\n\nThat said, what business do you have with us today?
Divines bless you, friend! World's a hard place, these days. My eleven children will surely starve today without a morsel to eat.\n\nWon't you spare some gold for an honest man and his poor children?
We've not had visitors to the Aetherian Archive in a long time. You should know that you pose a risk to yourself by stepping outside this chamber.\n\nThe Learned One does not want outsiders on the upper floors. I would not test her.
What do you want? Have you fools come to your senses? Ready to set me free?\n\nThe master will do it himself after he peels the skin off you! He will not suffer a member of his Court humiliated like this! I will not suffer it!
Stendarr protect you, friend. If Virmaril is the source of this darkness, then the danger is greater than I expected.\n\nI will seek another way inside. A way that avoids that terrible, insistent voice.
I have dreamed of trying an Oblivion pie since I first heard about them. But now, I erect the spine of ….\n\nI do not like this.
Ah, you've returned! How wonderful to see you again.\n\nTell me, were you successful? Did you acquire the items I asked for? Did you get the frozen egg?
Go! Go on! Leave me—damn you! I can take care of myself!
You were saying something about a betrayer and the stolen supplies?
That banekin got me good in my last bout. I took down a clannfear, but that little bastard snuck up on me. Got me bleeding like a pig.\n\nYeah. I suspect that's going to turn out to have been my last fight.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine once I catch my breath. Just got the wind knocked out of me a little, that's all.
I heard the bugle all the way over here. Did my archers' arrows strike true?
When this is all over, my father is going to disown me. And I hate to imagine what Lady Sovelle must think of me. There must be some way that I can make all this right.
I'm not one hundred percent certain, but I bet I could break the chain holding up the cage with a few well-placed arrows.
I … everyone's dead. Maybe … maybe there's still hope for the others. Solgra … she took them with her. Tried to hide in the back. I … I don't know what's happened to Solgra and the others.
You got the totem. Good. Wish I could have whacked that Riekr chieftain in the head with it, but I suppose you took care of that, too.
When I was trapped behind the fire and I thought I was going to die, all I could think about was Raza and going back to our home in Shornhelm.\n\nNow? Now I think I want to stay here and learn more about my Orc heritage.
Speak to Eveli. Convince her that we need her help or many innocent lives will be lost in Trinimac's name.\n\nThen you need to head for Paragon's Remembrance. We can't afford to waste time. The Vosh Rakh aren't going to wait for us, after all.
See what you can find in here. We can't let all of this be for nothing.
Was the high-and-mighty captain any help, or did she just tell you to tusk off, too?
You're … a little late.\n\nThey just … left me here to die ….
I needed to see for myself. To watch you end it. To show Malacath we are not his playthings.
I don't believe we have anything more to discuss. Away with you!
Are you headed back to the Imeprial City? Slay a few of those filthy Aldmeri fetchers for me.
Any problems with the switch? I hope not, I can't quite pull that off twice.
I wonder if Bazrag has any interest in a cornerclub. We wouldn't even need to change the name or anything.
You look weary, my friend. Why not have a seat? Stay and talk a while.
Pull up a seat by the hearth, friend. I could use the company.
Did you hear? There's some kind of trouble at Fharun Stronghold.
These pirates can get kind of wild when they've poured a few drinks down their gullets. That's why I love this place!
No Iron Wheel patrols near the docks. The coast is quite literally clear.
Spare coins for an Alliance War veteran?
Of all the times to take my advice, she decides to do so now.
What? I must have something in my eye. Mold spore or something. It's this damn cistern! Who lives in a cistern? I can't wait to get back to my garden.
My client lost a shipment of personal goods when his courier was attacked near the swamps. Nothing he couldn't afford to lose, mind, but he's a bit broken up about his late wife's necklace. See what you can do for him, will you?
This one does not like us abandoning the camp. Not safe leaving our valuables behind. Malihaz needs more eyes … or a twin brother. Something.
Hurry! Up the hill! He's feeding my companions to the trolls!
Good luck, and may Tall Papa bring you and our friends back safely.
If you get a chance, make those Iron Orcs pay for what they did to us. A little blood for blood, know what I mean? It's only fair.
Skeetees has decided to linger awhile longer. Especially now that the Scaled Court menace no longer looms like a wamasu over a nest of durzog cubs.
Use the portal and return to the Observatory. I will meet you there.
Finally! I thought you might have been eaten!\n\nIs it done? Did you take care of that madman, Drovos?
I love seeing new faces! For a while, it was just the same old miners and the occasional traveling merchant. Thought Carellon might have to shut this place down.\n\nLook at me, talking your ears off! What can I get you?
See what Vivec can tell us about Barbas—while he's still able to talk.
Friend, take up my cause. I beg you. Send word to Whiterun—to Riften—to anywhere! Falkreath Hold is falling! \n\nAn army of beastmen batters our gates … we aren't long for Sovngarde, but our kinsmen can carry Shor's vengeance in our stead.
Good luck in there, bear cub. Kyne only knows what's clanking around those ruins.
Do you mind? Your dirty foot coverings are contaminating my pond.
Halt, intruder! Before entering this vault, you must demonstrate that you understand the goals and beliefs of House Indoril.
What do you think of my luxurious accommodations? It's got dirt and rock, fungus and a paltry fire … all the comforts of home.\n\nAnyway, you said you had information about my brother, Ulran? What did you find out?
It was the councilor's daughter—Veya! She barged inside like a mad woman! I heard the clash of steel, screams and shouts. It was terrifying! And then the soldiers started filling the streets!\n\nDon't go in there. It's not safe!
You're not a cultist. At least, you sure aren't dressed like one.\n\nYou're walking into a dangerous place, hero. You must be here for a reason.
Have you talked to <<1>>? Always got plenty of work here in Slag Town.
The shadow array gives Night Sister Kamira power and dominion over this realm. Destroy it and everyone they lured into this place will be freed.
Still looking for your friend? Better hurry.
Ah, you've returned. Excellent. Raynor and I have cobbled together a serviceable frame for the lamp—all we need now are the components I sent you to acquire. Were you successful?
You're Lord Fyr's newest steward, eh? Could we talk later? If I don't finish this lamp inventory, Gascone will feed me to the fabricants.
Go find another beggar to bother. I've got more important things to do than carry some apostle hopeful's sack of dirty laundry!
Even though I sometimes see far-away places and future events, nothing can ever be truly certain. I knew you were coming to rescue me, but that didn't alleviate my fear. I thought I was going to die in Mephala's realm.\n\nThank you.
A newcomer, here in the Kinlady's garden? And during her latest rant on the dangers of the Queen's decree? Oh that's just grand!\n\nI really can't wait to see her expression when she finally notices your presence.
What a fool I've been! I was worried sick about Leythen while he was out cavorting with worshipers of Mephala.\n\nI lost our daughter, too, but you don't see me abandoning my friends and family. I didn't forsake the Psijic Order!
I just don't understand how Larydel and I could grow so far apart. Did I really lead him to believe I doubted his ability with magic? Does he really envy mine? If only he'd told me ….
It can't end here. There has to be something we can do to stop her.
I'm ever so pleased you could arrange this meeting. Manacar has been the perfect gentlemen, and such a great model! Inspiration is just flooding through me.
This one has seen many bizarre things working as an Eye of the Queen, but this may take the moon-sugar cake!\n\nA strange dog walked up and spoke to Raz!
Magic always makes Raz's head hurt, but this was an impressive feat! Go on, go talk to the Sapiarch.
A slap on the wrist. It'll take months, if not years, to restore my work to its original condition.\n\nYou've done me and Summerset a great disservice today.
I'm just glad I didn't find a pile of mud to wallow in. These robes are impossible to clean!
This situation sets a precedent that makes us uncomfortable. The Psijic Order tries our patience, but we will allow this council meeting to play out.\n\nRazum-dar has suggested we hear from you. So, please, talk to Larnatille and let's get on with it.
I still can't believe you were able to defeat Z'Maja. A feat not even the Welkynars could accomplish, in all their might.\n\nI'm so grateful the Stars led you to Cloudrest.
I grieve over the loss of my mentor and friend, Iachesis, but grief isn't going to stop Nocturnal. We need to find a way to turn this Daedric tide before the waters of Oblivion overwhelm us.\n\nThankfully, Sotha Sil has returned to Artaeum.
Welcome back, wayfarer. Was your journey successful? Have you acquired one of those beautiful eggs as I requested?
Haxara stays then. I will help how I can, but I will also be watchful.
Welcome to Lilmoth, friend! Is that a shrewd and discerning gaze I detect? I know a fellow entrepreneur when I meet one!\n\nI'm a financier, you see, and I have an exciting business proposition—if you're interested, of course.
Do not worry, Mateem—Uraz will turn up. He probably stopped to gather razor-clams for the feast. always thinking with his belly, you know?
I … I think I have to lie down for a moment. \n\nAnd after that, it's off to get the farm back in order. Let's just hope I can honor Keema-Ru's dedication. Elsewise … well, I don't want to think about the elsewise.
Beeko, it's so good to see you! Xal-Sisei, it's our friend, they came to see us.
I always heard that … introspection could be difficult. But meeting yourself … no one likes to discover that they were a tallow-catch.\n\nTry not to … hold it against me. Him and me … we're two sides of a … of a dented coin.
Like most of Abnur Tharn's plans, it is both brilliant and daring. If it has any chance to succeed, however, we need a way to get a small force into the palace without being seen.\n\nLuckily, I may have an answer.
How could Kideya have been so blind!\n\nYou and Razum will go into the tunnel, yes? Find whoever has been stealing our moon-sugar and make sure they never do so again.
Tharn and Nala-do gave me their accounts of the attack on the outpost. Dragons, undead, Euraxia's soldiers. Our foes seem as numerous as grains of sand in the desert.\n\nTharn and I have discussed options, but we have not settled on our next move yet.
We could always use more supplies. Who knows how long we'll be trapped in this foul city.
This brew is my own invention, if you can believe it!\n\nYou see, the Khajiit aren't typically fond of rotmeth. I think the rancid meat smell is what turns them off. That's why I added plenty of moon-sugar to my brew! It's sure to be a hit now.
Greetings! It is good to see another traveler. Please! Come join us for a few moments. We would love the company.
Hey, you came! Did the Ruddy Fangs still have my things?
We need to hurry and find the wounded Dragon. The tremors grow worse with every passing moment and I fear we're running out of time.
If the captain embarrasses me in front of Queen Khamira, I am going to bite his head off.
It's no surprise Lahini ran off with someone else. Hard enough to share a drink with Kazahn, much less a bed.
Well met, warrior. Do you seek peace as well? Whenever I'm feeling anxious, I like to come here and meditate.
You walk with purpose, hunter. What hastens your steps?
We did it. Senchal is finally safe from Laatvulon and the Order of the New Moon.\n\nThere are other Dragons to contend with, of course. But we'll defeat those too, won't we? Just like the Dragonguard of legend.
Hail, O honored warrior.\n\nBlademaster Sai Sahan has need of your aid once more. A Dragon nests on a nearby island, and he believes it means to attack Senchal. He hopes to slay the beast before it can strike against the city.
Oh good, you're just in time. We've hit a wall in the investigation ….\n\nHow did it go with Elle?
Stop! Stop, just … stand still a moment. Oh, it's no use. There are currently four of you, and the longer I look at them, the less I trust my stomach. \n\nTalk to my sister while I compose myself.
This better be important. Unless you want to pick up a rake, I don't have time to jaw at strangers.
Can I help you dryskin? Or do you wish to ask me how I find the cold?
I'm not losing my sister to some lunatic pureblood. We push on until we find her!
The interrogation is over now, right? I need to … I need to find a healer. A witch to purge whatever this is out of my blood.\n\nYou got what you wanted. Now, let me go!
I don't mind telling you, I'm in no hurry to get back in that mine.
Ah, good. You received my message. I was almost tempted to go exploring. This is Blackreach, my friend! The legendary land beneath the land. If I had realized it existed, I would have come here long ago.\n\nNo matter. Are you still with me in this?
The door opened, but something happened to Arana. She mentioned something about a darkness.\n\nWe should check on her, but we also need to determine that the keystone we seek is here.
Well, a vateshran can't pick his audience, especially in a place like this.\n\nDon't suppose you could part with some coin for a performance of mine? My tales thrill and inform. And some coin in my pocket—a soul's got to eat. You won't regret it.
Friend! I hoped I'd bump into you another time.\n\nI have something I wanted to say to you.
Meet Arana back at Rebel's Retreat. I'll wait here for Verandis.
You caught me in a moment of quiet contemplation … but, please, join me.
I believe that Eveli wants a word with you, mercenary.
Councilor Lovidicus is ready to speak with you now. Just don't push him too hard. He's been through a terrible ordeal today.
I'll be sure to mention your role in my rescue, too. The debt of a Tirethi is a valuable thing—especially one who will one day become a magister!
I think that's everything we're going to find. Let's take another look at the evidence and see if we can figure out what's going on here.
Hmm … a stranger wandering through Stonewastes. Have the scavengers arrived to pick the bones of our village?\n\nIf that's why you came, well, there's not much left. We are already squeezed dry.
Your test is complete. And with barely a scale out of place. Impressive.\n\nDo you like my blades? The hilt is kagouti bone. And Meer-Ta himself enchanted them. Back when I could tolerate the withered toad.
The portal is over there, little mortal. You do realize how much energy it requires to keep such a passage open, don't you?\n\nNo, of course you don't. But rest assured, it will take you to a spot close to the warded annex. Now go.
Thanks again for what you did for my family, sera.\n\nWe all survived this trial because of you, and somehow Bevene seems healthier than ever! Whatever medicine that little Wood Elf made must have been miraculous.
There are a lot of relieved villagers here, thanks to your efforts. Well done, friend.
Well, that's been dealt with rather handily. Time to be on my way. I have a wedding to prepare for.
I can't believe Councilor Vandacia betrayed us! That he was behind the murders of his fellow councilors. And that he's the leader of a damn Daedric cult!\n\nBut that's a worry for another time. Right now, Eveli Sharp-Arrow has need of you.
Destruction is a harsh end to anything, but often necessary. Ridding the world of these eggs will no doubt save lives in the long run. \n\nI hope you leave here in peace, knowing you made the right choice.
Another outsider. Our village is under attack, outsider. If you can't help, then leave.
That was the last of the emanations … and the last of the Knights of the Silver Rose. I even see the items stolen from my temple within this vault. All the wrongs here have finally been set right.
We'll hold the line, to the last of us if we have to, so get on with your mission so it doesn't come to that!
Sister Celdina is in the next chamber. She's been awaiting your arrival.
You acquired a portal key? Good. The portal may be warded against Kyn, but it has no such protections against you or the Anchorite.\n\nTalk to Lyranth. She has a plan.
Word of Valkynaz Nokvroz's defeat has spread quickly. I smell Madam Whim's hand in that. So many people have turned out to hail the triumph of Arox the Mutilator!\n\nAnd you, as well, master.
I know that I said last time I was done fighting. But, honestly and truly, I think this is the last one for me. Not that I regret it! Just … oh my. I'm exhausted. And filthy.\n\nBut it's over! We did it! And I was able to help, because of you.
I thought we were done with you, but no. My mistress Lyranth has once again sent me far and wide to bring you an important message.\n\nShall I impart the words of the Dread Lady now, or would you rather wait until after the Dagonists destroy the world?
Have you seen my mistress? Lyranth, the Dread Lady? I've looked everywhere. Has she … forsaken me?
Oh, no. It looks like Lady Arabelle's messenger has gone and had too much of the Duforts' wine. Someone ought to stop him before he removes any more of his clothing.
This has to be the entrance to the hideout. I might have missed it if it weren't for Tarazka's lantern. \n\nCome on, let's get in there. Valessea awaits!
It pains me that we weren't able to save the archdruid. It really appears that the Allwither took control of her without her consent or knowledge.\n\nAt least we were able to restore the Evergrowth and stop the spread of corruption.
It appears that you and Druid Audrine did well in the Undergrove. \n\nThe nature spirit wants to have a final word with you, adventurer. Go on. I'm eager to hear what it has to say.
Captain Tsuzo and I will be all right. You go help Prince Irnskar.
We did it! Once the prisoners and sentries recover, they'll be able to return to work. Without having to worry about being attacked too!
You have already done so much for the archipelago, I hesitate to ask for more. But while the threat of the Ascendant Lord still looms, Lord Bacaro will be reluctant to move forward with the peace talks. The safety of the leaders is paramount.
Let me have a look at you, marine. Hmm … yes, you'll make a fine addition to the assault force.\n\nWe only have time to land a few of you, so every fighter we send will have to count for ten.
I feel terribly that he made off with Isobel's ring.\n\nGood luck finding it! I hope he's not too much trouble for you two.
I've got a lot of work to get through here. But tonight I'm going to enjoy a nice cool ale at the Mermaid. Maybe finally work up the nerve to talk to Witalia. Maybe ask her what she thinks of my tattoos? Heh heh.
Eager to begin the next tournament? Then I have good news! The Roister's Club just sent word that our new opponents will arrive soon!\n\nWe have time, though. I imagine they are in no hurry to face defeat at the hands of our chapter's newest prodigy.
A battle at All Flags Castle? Who could have believed it? Nothing's happened there for hundreds years … until these Tamsfolk brought their troubles here. At least it's settled now.
I owe you my thanks, walker. I found all the Ascendant Order knights I could hope for during that fight on All Flags Islet. I can finally say my crewmates from the Perfect Pounce have been avenged.
You rescued the alliance leaders? I thought you were amazing when you helped me in Brokerock Mine. But, friend, you're incredible!
There you are! Everyone's talking about how great you and Lady Arabelle are and all the great stuff you did! Everything you did at Tor Draioch must seem small in comparison.\n\nI've been bragging about knowing you, I hope that's all right.
Be careful. There are more Firesong druids here than I expected. Archdruid Orlaith must be planning something big to bring this many of her circle from Y'ffelon.
There you are. I decided to see for myself if Archdruid Rahval and his druids were coming to help defend the city. And I wanted to find you.\n\nI made contact with Captain Siravaen. She agreed to aid Vastyr, but only if she can recover her ship.
I didn't expect to leave that ruined castle alive. Thank you, mainlander. \n\nPlease, give the sacred seed to Archdruid Ellic. Tell him I almost failed him, but I didn't … thanks to you.
Tell Druid Laurel that I will miss her, friend. I will miss you all.
Well, sellsword, can House Mornard count on you to safeguard the island?
I was sure I was going to die on Y'ffelon. I'm still trying to sort out what happened. What it all means. Why, the—oh, that can wait for later.\n\nIt looks like Stefan wants to talk to you.
The Society of the Steadfast is a philanthropic organization. What few knights I have are purely for the defense of our pavilions. Our assistance to Galen is as relief, nothing more.\n\nIt's good to see that Sir Stefan has confidence in you, though.
That Druid Laurel of the Stonelore Circle, she's trying to get us all to work together. I suppose these peace talks are giving us all ideas.
I'm sorry, I suppose I'm still in shock. I've known Jocien was gone for some time … but you spoke with his ghost!\n\nAnd he wanted me to have his ring, after all this time. Romantic, isn't it? He was always like that.
Thank you for aiding in our cause. When you find knights in the keep who would stand up for what's right, send them to me out here. \n\nWe will make preparations to storm the keep and stop Sir Croix and this rash attack.
I hear King Fahara'jad's been plotting to take over Alcaire for years.
I can talk about my son all day long if you like. I do love him so. I just hope he eventually straightens himself out.
I'd go with you, but I can't disobey Master Altien.\n\nPlease take the scroll to him.
That totem's got to come down from the tower, or we'll never be rid of these Goblins.\n\nBlast you, Rama! I'll have your hide for this.
I've used the same poultice on myself that you used on the other wardens. I should be fine. \n\nSeriously, don't worry. Go on now.
I asked Abbot Durak to go downstairs because I wanted to speak with you for a few moments alone.\n\nTell me something. Do you recall everything that happened in the dream?
Thank you. I was beginning to lose faith. So many selfish people just walk by, abandoning me and my sister to fate.\n\nIf you can just convince her to leave the house, then she and I can get out of here and go back to Camlorn.
If you can just take care of those portals, I'm sure the rest of the scamps will wander off eventually.
Well, that didn't work. Time to come up with a new plan … again.
Soon, my husband and I will travel to Wayrest to get away from these gossipy provincial villagers.
I will return home and speak with King Fahara'jad. I hope we can now focus on the loss of the one we loved rather than the crime that took her life. \n\nTime heals all wounds, or so they say.
I can hardly believe it. <<1>> killed, and here I am speaking to the one who did it.\n\nI hated that Orc. If I could watch him die again, I would.
Revenge is sweet.\n\nIf only it could have been me out there. I'd have torn that beast's legs off one at a time.
The Red Rooks are done here. We'll be able to clear the rest of them out.
Go, find Alana. We'll deal with Faolchu, once and for all.
My sisters return to camp. Speak with the guardian.
I'll protect the portal and keep the Bloodthorn at bay. You go rescue my father.
Hm. I suppose that answers the question. Our fates are no more fixed than the wind that blows across these dunes.\n\nUnless … do you think maybe that was not the right wind storm? Do you believe that maybe there is another … just about to appear?
My commander will hear of your exploits, I promise you.
Now that you've picked a lizard, you can enter it in a race. Put your lizard in a starting cage when you're ready, and let's watch that baby fly!
I hardly see why you deserved payment at all. Still, you are one of the few who actually bothered to return to let me know.
Hurry! You need to switch the orders before they start to move out for Volenfell. \n\nThey could strike camp suddenly. You never know with armies … it's always hurry up and wait.
I've sent dispatches to locate Scout Fontbonne. I'll let you know when we've found him.
Our guar barns are south of here. Burn the barrel of brandy, get his attention, and butcher him like the animal he is.\n\nThen bring me the antidote so that I can save my mother. Please!
The guardians are in place. Good.\n\nNow we can finish this.
I knew a woman would successfully navigate the Coiled Path.
I see you returned, but with empty hands. We're only going to get so many chances, so be more careful this time.
Good luck in your travels, warm-blood.
Hold it right there. This is Duke Nathaniel's personal library. No access without his express permission.
I sense change. The curse retreats, broken. You've succeeded?
I'll be waiting in the stables. Try not to get murdered.
The Trial of the Mind begins in the chamber below.
I can't believe you brought Omalor out for us.\n\nOh, I'm going to enjoy this.
We're not dead. Amazing!\n\nI need a little time to recover. Go speak to Vaama and get that other Daedric essence.
What are you waiting for? Light the fire.
Argh! It burns! It burns!
The urge to plunge your hand in fire, to spill your own blood? My whisper in your ear, supplicant. Know that I made you the instrument of my will.
Who knows what <<1>> thought she was after? What clawless fool records her plan in a journal?\n\nAelif would like to point out that the Dwarves believed in nothing. What would they know of Molag Bal's plot?
Say, I think you told me a whopper.
Isn't it beautiful? The most beautiful part of the chateau. You can see why I've held onto the place all these years.
My work here is nearly complete, comrade. The core will soon be a weapon once again.
As soon as I get this lift working, I'll meet you down there. Just watch out for the constructs. These ruins are always full of constructs.\n\nAnd if you spot the lore vault, please tell Kireth. That's what she's down there looking for.
What do you think? We've only got the one orb you found.
Ah, the brave and mysterious champion returns. Do you have something for me?
One of our strikers will meet you inside the cave.\n\nThe captain has an iron will, but I fear she won't hold out much longer, if the tales of <<1>> are true.
She's waiting for you at the Rawl'kha Guildhall in Reaper's March. Good luck, comrade.
You've saved Velyn Harbor from devasation, and the Fists of Thalmor from a great embarrassment.\n\nSpeaking of great embarrassments, please talk to <<1>>.
The shallows in this bay are treacherous, but the Maormer navigated through those reefs like they've been doing it their whole lives.
Grimclaw will never complain about our music again!
It seems no tale ever truly ends. The characters change, but the tale goes on.\n\nNow, we must fulfill our roles.
We're back! The High Kinlord is safe and Queen Ayrenn's alliance is secure.\n\nNot bad for a day's work.
Music has its place, though I prefer the spoken word.
So. It's finally over.
Hmph. Quite the busybody about town, aren't you?
This one has no time for talk now. I must tend to this poor man. Though I fear with the reagents I have on hand… there may be little more I can do.
Woo-hoo!
Good work. You're tougher than you look.
Please find my husband! His name is Pirtar. He was still in the house when the roof fell in!
<Raynor Vanos is sound asleep.>
You're a clever one. I figured this would all end in bloodshed. Turning an Orc's wounded pride against him is no easy task.
Ask questions later. You need to get spriggan bark so we can save your remaining friend.
As you see, Headman Bhosek's trust in my skills was not misplaced. Nor was my faith in your prowess.\n\nWill you assist me on another task?
Byz not get in way! Let Byz alone!
Hello to you, Aniel's friend. This one wishes we had brought more moon-sugar with us. Roasts always taste better lathered in sweet.
As I expected. <<1>> is hiding something, but I don't know what.\n\nGood thing we've already planned for this. Are you ready for a little subterfuge?
I should warn you, Gloo is a little … odd. But she's a damned genius when it comes to alchemy.
That map—it marks the location of our treasures! Listen, I don't know how you got it, and I can't stop you from looking for those relics with these necromancers around, but if you find them, bring them to me.\n\nI'll make it worth your while.
What are you still doing here? Shuzura will be wanting you there now, not when you feel like it.
Ah! Thank Alkosh you found her! We've lost enough soldiers today without adding our best scout to their ranks. \n\nWith luck, the two of you will find more, yes?
To think that my brother was afflicted by something similar to Sir Hughes … that's frightening indeed. \n\nI thank you for helping him. I still hope we're able to bring Sir Hughes to justice for what happened to my sweet Lakana.
Looks like you found his family. Maybe he isn't as full of Elf dung as I thought.
The thought of the dead walking around is unsettling at best. Soon they'll be shambling into Cropsford!
His life mate <<1>> warned him of the dangers here, but <<2>> did not listen. The son of Muzag is as stubborn as he is naive.
Rumors say that the people of Zuuk were wiped out by a flu years ago.
You're the talk of the town. Why don't you come over here and let me thank you?
Ears that large and you still don't listen? Perhaps you need a few alterations.\n\nThere was a time when the sound of <<1>>'s voice commanded the terror of thousands.
You are with the Khajiit, outsider. I know this. Go. Talk to your friend.
Happy just for the chance to do something normal. Relaxed. Thank the Green for you.
The scribs kept away from that fetching tree trunk. They don't seem to care for it. If you help it do what it needs to do, I have no doubt they'll find their way back to shore.
Thank you once again for what you did. Let's not speak of the details. Thorinor has worried enough as it is. You brought us back together, and that's all that matters to us.
Oh! You startled me!
You've got to let us out!
We will stay here to protect the priestess from the bandits, in case you drive any of them out.
Use the keys on the pillars and we'll be on our way to Moonhenge. Well, this Moonhenge. Confusing, isn't it?
When inspecting all the claws of this plan, this one is not so sure it will work.
I know you are a guest in our city, wayfarer, so I will forgive your ignorance, but the fellowship hall is open to Crowns only.
Ruptga's blessings upon you and your house, wayfarer. \n\nI apologize for the poor state of our streets. The recent unpleasantness in the wastes has brought an influx of Forebears from the west—and you know how they are.
You have returned. Did you ignore the instructions of the Champions as well? Raz hears that is something you do.
Now remove the heart and there may be a chance we can grow a new one.
Help me clear a path so we can get <<1>> out of here safely.
The manor is everything you hoped for, isn't it? But look at you! You could really use a bath.
Looking for something? A set of keys, perhaps?
The harpies are congregated around this building. Looks like the mercenaries took something every bit as valuable as the harpies' eggs.
I beg your pardon, O wayfarer, but I must hold to my work. Many and many of my tribe-folk require attention.
Everything is so … very different. It's like I'm no longer a single physical form, but my being is spread out across the forest.\n\nAranias is slipping away. You are my friend though, whoever I become. Will you stay for just a moment?
Anyone could defeat you, with enough training.
This one is so proud of Yenadar. To give himself so that others might live. Thank you for being honest with me. I know he would have wanted me to know the truth.
I don't know how you found us, but we need your help. The forest has turned against our village, and we've been forced to take refuge in this cave.
You don't understand what you're doing!
This is the Thalmor Headquarters, our base for operations in the region.\n\nThe locals have voiced some issues with our presence, but they recognize the necessity in the face of the Dominion's current troubles. At least, they had best do so.
Keep those marauders off my ship!
Quick, close that door! That's a dreadful draft!\n\nIn the meantime, I'll make sure none of the Dark Lord's minions creeps up on you.
I won't beg, but I implore you to restore my son. I have waited so long for this moment.
Who are you? Can't you see I'm having a drink with my friend here …? \n\nMight as well embrace the crows; they're here to stay. If anyone goes, it'll be us, not them.
<<1>> is currently off-limits. You'll need to keep back, for your own safety.
Back again, eh? Now, which contract did I give you?
Welcome to the chasm my friend. We're nearly there.
Well fought! Sai Sahan travels with worthy companions.
Reynelle was a kindly one—she entered these Vaults with us, and I'd like her to leave with us, if the Mad Architect hasn't scattered her soul across Oblivion.
Balance will be restored before too long, I think! With laurels, wine, and crushed velvet lining, yes?
I should warn you. Ravenwatch Castle is as strange as the man who owns it. His family is very old, and they have … strange traditions.\n\nDon't worry, though. I have no doubt about the fact that he is on our side. You may rely on anything he says.
I was wondering when you were going to show up.\n\nWant a bite?
Do you have them? You have them, don't you?\n\nOh, I shouldn't get my hopes up. They fell in the sea, didn't they? I knew it, I have the worst luck.
This one can't believe we have to go all the way back to <<1>>. The last time we were in Arenthia, <<2>> hitched a ride on a cargo ship and ended up in Senchal!
<Scouting mission notices and reports are posted to this board.>
Really, I hate constant interruptions. If it weren't for my friend <<1>>, I'd never have come to visit.
Keep your steel sheathed in the presence of the High King, or you'll answer to me.
Fascinating, isn't it? To think that such a tiny rock could hold so much power. Can you feel it? It's like it's calling to me. Like the moons call to the tides.\n\nImagine what the relic it came from could do!
Go away. I've got nothing for you. This table's for the Undaunted. What counts as Undaunted in these parts, anyway.
Are you Undaunted? No. Get out of here … uh … daunted.
Huh, who are you?
I don't see Althen. If you have questions, that's fine, but at this point, I'm counting on you.\n\nYou don't want to disappoint the Ring of Daggers, do you?
Nice of you to finally join us. Those damn Montclairs have locked me out of my own city!\n\nIf any of my people have been hurt, I'll kill Montclair and his daughter with my bare hands.
My friend from Hoarfrost! These two wouldn't be here if not for you. You should be proud.\nJulien and Shuga have turned out to be great soldiers.\n\nMartin couldn't cut it, though. Abandoned his post one night. I hear he's back in the stocks again.
Glory has no patience for the idle. Go prove your worth against the Reachmen in Shor's Stone.
Many believe the Nedes were barely more than barbarians, but ruins like this prove otherwise. Don't underestimate their cleverness. Look for a pattern if you can, and consider the possibility that the lock was designed to be impossible to open alone.
Strike the Lost One down. It is the only way to end this.
I owe you much, my friend. One day, your kindness shall be repaid.
Did I hear that right? You're going into those caverns?\n\nWe're in no shape to do it, so you might as well. But you'll need some potent soul gems to take those cultists on. Lucky for you, I have a few lying around.
You've got to help me! By the Eight—the pain!
You're here for crafting certification, yes? Fear not, your alliance covers my considerable fees.\n\nIf you can prove your basic competence, I'll certify you so you may fulfill crafting writs.
What a waste of a perfectly good opportunity! Oh, very well, I'll defer to your expertise in diplomatic matters. I guess remaining alive is reward enough.\n\nI heard about a nearby Ayleid ruin. I think we'll head there and explore. Farewell, friend.
The Order of the Silver Dawn will survive. We will one day rid the world of these murderous werewolves.\n\nOn this, you have my word.
Another outsider, here to perform tricks for the false king?\n\nBah, go back to Kurog and leave a real clan chief in peace.
Aishah is happy to see you again, walker. You have been busy, yes?\n\nYou rescued the people as this one asked?
This one is relaxing. Can you not see this? Please, just go away.
Glad to see you made it out of there without twisting your ankle or anything. But I don't see our contract target.\n\nYou weren't able to find Khoruzoth, I take it?
The Orcs will negotiate with me. There's still time to salvage my mission and make sure Ethian's father lives to regret what he set in motion.\n\nBut thank you. Without your timely assistance, more innocents would have been lost.
I knew I liked you the moment I saw you!\n\nChief Bazrag is big and mean and looks like he can fight, but there were an awful lot of marauders. Ice-Heart's Winterborn won't stop until Bazrag and all the Orc peasants are dead. You better hurry!
Running off to <<1>> is why <<2>>'s still unwed. Finding glory in old relics instead of at the king's side? He'd have chosen her if she wasn't so headstrong. Pah!
Meet me in the rectory when you're finished—it should be safe there.\n\nNow stay low. You don't want to be strung up like the rest of these dolts. We're just going to find Egnatius and get out of here, right? We're agreed …? Just nod.
I'll get this lot out of the city, but they won't have much. A few blankets, a crust of bread …. From what I hear, Cyrodiil isn't kind to refugees. I can only hope, I guess.
Ah, you're just in time. We finished clearing out the Vosh Rakh and the remaining chiefs are waiting for me to address them.\n\nBut, word of Kurog's death is spreading through the city like wildfire. I don't know how the people will react to the news.
Why do you linger? <<1>>'s assassins already advance upon the duel.\n\nWarn them. Hurry!
So, ready for another journey into the frontier? I've heard that some more of those brutish ogres were sighted doing … well, ghastly things with my book. That will not do.
Hide, quickly!
I'll see you at <<c:1>>. I have a few things to discuss with <<2>>.
Your date made it back before you. Informed us of what happened at the wedding. \n\nDon't blame yourself. <<1>> told you to leave.
I deserve such cruelty.
This hot desert sun feels so good upon my flesh! Not like the pitiful sun we have in Skyrim!
Your words rekindled the memories this one thought were long gone. So I decided to come to Abah's Landing sooner rather than later.
It seems you have me at a disadvantage. But you don't have to be afraid of me. Put away your weapons and I'll help you in whatever way I can.
Hey, quit poking around! I've got work to do and so do you. What more could you want from me?
Well, you look interesting. I'm quite certain I don't remember seeing you around the castle before. Even so, I do hope there's a good reason for this interruption.
Fortunata's death bodes well for the future of the Gold Coast, but our problems remain. I need to consult with the Speaker and determine how best to collect the rest of what Count Carolus owes us.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll leave you to your contracts.
I know you can handle yourself, but I have a feeling that the Black Dragon is leading you right where she wants you. She's treating you as easy prey.\n\nShow her that's a mistake. Find her and send her to the Void.
Strike the Lost One down. It is the only way to end this.
I can't believe they ate our friends. What kind of monsters would do something like that? I mean, other than Iron Orcs and trolls, that is.
May your grace be noted by Mara herself. Your donation shall help feed the orphans.\n\nYou are of course welcome to cull the wildlife, should you desire to aid us further.
Good luck with your dung-pile sing-along. If you develop some common sense, I'll be here.
You look thirsty! Find a seat and I'll be around shortly to take your order.
I'm surprised to see you back here, but I'm also relieved. Does this mean you have news about my daughter? Is she safe? Is she ready to come home?
The councilor has his priorities all out of sorts. The real threat lies to the south!
Great work with that flash stone! Just milling up a new batch of powder now. Got plenty of pipes to cut by week's end. Thanks again.
Emile? Is that you? Where is Haladan? Is he all right?
I don't care if you create a masterpiece with that bloom. It will never replace the natural beauty that's been lost here today.\n\nFirst that Vaerelel fellow, now you. Will I ever not be plagued by greedy artists?
Something else? We can discuss the letter of recommendation for Ambassador Rigurt after you have acquired the mementos of cultural significance from the newcomers Urjurra, Ondare, and Grayscale.\n\nI shall await your quick return.
Find the Redguard named Miriya. I sense her somewhere deep within the ruins.
Huh? Need something?
And just like that, Auri-El provides.\n\nGreetings, ceruval. I am Chief Jurisreeve Tarnamir of the Divine Prosecution … or at least I was, in the long ago. I know this is unorthodox, but perhaps you'd be interested in helping us?
What the—? How did I get up here?
The time has come, initiate. We must gather the final fragments of the Staff of Towers.
Miriya. She's a remarkable young woman. One of the best sword fighters I've ever seen. Please find her and free her from the mind trap.
Your patronage of my research shows exemplary moral character. You have my thanks.
I am glad to know my horse is safe. Thank you for finding her.
The time has come.\n\nRest easy. I am certain that both Josajeh and the Augur will be fine. No—they will do better than that. They will thrive.
Raz had many plans for what he would do once Summerset was safe. Fine drink, fine food, a chance to relax.\n\nInstead he must deal with the petty squabbles of High Elves. Nothing ever changes.
<Conquest mission notices and reports are posted to this board.>
He did not have to die. Narazda could have taught him to control it. We of the moons … we are not all like Vykosa and her ilk.
We need to keep moving, before the other hunters find that indrik.
We won't be able to direct the Soul Gem's power without functional shock conveyors. They're common Dwemer technology, but we'll need the most pristine you can find for what I'm planning.
You're back! I … I'm getting a taste of the smoke too. Enough to see shapes—hear whispers. The Argonians you spoke to seem unlike any I've met here in Murkmire. Not Bright-Throat or Dead-Water, but a different tribe entirely!\n\nThere must be more!
You're a long way from home, ojel. Best tread carefully if you wish to return to it.
Famia may not know how to save her hide, but she knows much about the ebb and flow of Murkmire. You should find her quickly.
There is Numaia's favorite ranch hand! When Milksop and sneaky Marmalade returned, this one knew you would not be far behind.
There is a cavern deep within the Litter. If memory serves, it ascends to the Baan Dar Gate. We will find the aqueduct blockage and Vazbi there.\n\nCome. We must hurry.
Good luck with this dog, walker. Jahlar has heard many unsettling things about such animals, so be careful, yes?
Zamarak will assist Tharn against the Dragons. In the meantime, you should go inside. Queen Khamira is waiting for you.
Ah, excuse me. If I may be so bold, you match the description I was given. I have a message for you, if you're willing to accept it.
Stink! You stink like oil! Get, or I bite you! Bite, bite!
The Betrayer did terrible things to the Khajiit of old. Zumog Phoom must not be allowed to return that monster to life.\n\nDo whatever you must, walker. Whatever you must.
Can't you see I'm busy? Go away.
Our final battle, is it? How fortunate for you to have Za'ji by your side.
Finish any other business you have in Solitude, then meet me at the Blue Palace so we can report to Queen Gerhyld.
Eh? What's that? Oh? No, but more wine, please.\n\nFive thousand! Oh, wait—has the auction started? Oh, dash it all … seven thousand!
It's good to see you, my friend. I feared the worst when the Reachmen started pouring out of the cave. \n\nSince you're here and the bridge is still standing, I assume your mission was a success?
I never thought I'd be so happy to see the sky again.\n\nI don't even care what happens now. Just glad I have my life.
Are you investigating this now as well? We already have too many people involved as it is.
An undead army shattered, an evil Vampire Lord destroyed, and a monstrous I-don't-know-what banished back to Oblivion. You do incredible work.\n\nSeriously, I don't know what might have happened if you weren't here. Thanks.
Well, well. Rigurt the Brash's surprisingly comely friend! I don't have any unopened bottles left, but you could probably fill a flagon if you're willing to mix a few of the vintages. \n\nSo? Get drinking! There isn't anything else to do, is there?
One last riddle, assistant! One final test! Then I … we, will reap the rewards!\n\nSo, tell me. What did Maelmoth's tome reveal?
Not looking for new friends. Best move along before I make things unpleasant.
Oh, dark days are upon us! The Gray Host, an army raised from the dead!\n\nHow will we survive such horrors? How?
Welcome to Dusktown, traveler. Enjoy your stay, and try not to stray too far into the dark.
Use the keystone, my friend. It's finally time for me to confront Rada al-Saran.
We've reminisced enough, there are more pressing matters that require your attention. Like Ard Caddach's dwindling patience. \n\nWe'll catch up later—in fact, I demand it.
I've traveled all across the Reach, seen clans of all types and beasts beyond description. My tales deserve every coin they earn.
I'm bound to follow my chief, so I followed when he left. But … I keep thinking of the vateshran's story. I wonder why the elders won't share it with the rest of the clan?
By even agreeing to perform the Vateshran's Rites, you show more courage than other outsiders. The Reach crawls with those who don't belong here these days. But only you show us this respect.\n\nLet's hope you survive.
Right. I suppose this is the last time we'll see one another until we get to the other side of all this. Keep an eye on Seeks, won't you? And try not to have too much of a daring escapade without me.
While you talk to the Ambitions and figure out a new place to hide them, I'll work with Governor Keshu's people. Try to get a better handle on this threat her spymaster has detected.\n\nIf Vandacia is nearby, I'll flush him out.
I hate all this waiting around for something to happen! Especially when I know our time is short. We have control of our power for the moment, but Sombren assures us that it won't last.
Must the Chamber of Legates hold their meeting in my audience hall? I can barely hear myself think with all the commotion!
We are drawing close to something of immense power. I have no doubt it's this Cataclyst we've learned about. Now isn't the time or place for squabbling. We need to focus on finishing the mission and getting out of here alive.
When Vandacia killed Destron, he said he took my brother's power and gave it to Mehrunes Dagon. But I don't think he got all of it. Sombren was more powerful during our wanderings. I assumed it was the book, but now I think he got Destron's egonymic.
Luna Beriel has jobs that you can handle on your own and Vaveli Indavel trades in tasks that require groups of adventurers. \n\nRegardless of which job you take, I guarantee you'll be paid well for your work. That's a House Hexos promise.
Mehrunes Dagon is defeated, master. The Deadlands is the plane of change, of revolution! What will become of it while its Prince suffers defeat?
Tell me again, mortal. What, exactly, did Elegian say to you when you asked about the Riven Cataclyst?
Without a doubt, I'm grateful for what you showed me back in that cursed mine. I already took out … ten, I think? Much better than what I could have done before you came.\n\nNot saying that I'm glad my family and friends were captured, you understand
It is the duty of the Grasp to interpret the Stricture and make sure it is adhered to. It is a heavy responsibility.
You don't have the shifty eyes of most Gleaners. What do you want?
Prices are fixed and all sales are final. Cheats and hagglers do business at their peril.
We can't leave to wander about the Deadlands. And staying means misery. How did I manage to get stuck within Wretched Spire? Will I live out my life like this?
Thanks for talking to Tarazka. He's as cranky as ever. Anyway, that prisoner he mentioned must be the lovely Valessea. We need to rescue her. \n\nCome on, let's get inside and find Valessea and her kidnappers!
Go on. Do whatever you need to do to make that medallion safe. I can't believe I was about to hand something dangerous to my liege lord. It's my job to protect him. I dread to think what might have happened if you showed up a few moments later.
I don't believe we've met. Jonne Mornard—a pleasure. My family is in shipping. We import goods from the mainland and send wares from the archipelago to markets in Tamriel.\n\nYou're the investigator working with Lady Arabelle, aren't you?
Hopefully Valessea's shell will make finding the medallions a piece of cake. Go ahead, try using it.
Having a brave protector by my side feels so much better than going alone. But they'll notice I'm gone soon. So we should be on our way.\n\nI don't doubt someone powerful like you could take them all on. But watching that violence would upset me.
After you, champion.
We need to find Lady Arabelle first. Hopefully she knows where High King Emeric is. Let's watch out for the Ascendant Champion, too. I have a feeling we might finally get introduced.
I shall return Dame Madach's body to our order. After I take a moment to rest, of course.
Good gathering, traveler. The grove welcomes all. Feel free to wander about and enjoy its many offerings.
We should get a move on before these pirates realize what's going on.
Za'ji wishes more of the Perfect Pounce crew was here to see this. But he and Caska will do what we can to honor our lost shipmates.\n\nWe are ready for All Flags when you are, five-claw.
I think it's safe to say this diplomatic mission turned out differently from what my father anticipated.
Marbruk is peaceful. This one likes it here very much. \n\nIt is strange to be free, to not be beholden to anyone or anything. Jhaka appreciates this new life you have made possible.
Walk off, pal. No time for useless chatter.
Aye, what can I do for you? You looking to book a cargo ship?
My head. Got it right smacked up. The ship. Sunigil. So much light.
Look around, friend. All these people are here because of you. I don't know what we would have done without you.
Draigh, look at all these people. And they're all here because of you!
I forbid you from adding my accursed brother's name to that memorial plaque. I'm the master builder and I absolutely forbid it!
Don't say I didn't warn you. Save the day once and everyone expects you to do it again. But save the day twice? You'll never know a moment's peace.\n\nDon't worry. I won't get in your way. I'm officially out of the hero business—for real this time!
As someone who breaks rocks for a living, you've done amazing work on these crystals. One hit and they break into pieces!\n\nI think standing near all this lava has made me a bit dizzy. Let's hurry and find that last one.
Come to think of it, this must be about the peace talks. Queen Ayrenn and the other leaders are quite annoyed that the talks haven't started yet.\n\nHurry, friend. Go to Mandrake Manor. And tell Lady Arabelle that Za'ji sent you, just like she asked.
I'll see these druids back to their village. You should return to Vastyr and report to Sir Stefan. He needs to know what happened here.\n\nHe should be back in Castle Mornard by now. You'll find him there.
And just between us, the talks with the druid circles aren't going too badly. I just lose patience sometimes. I want everything to happen right now, but flowers blossom when they're ready, am I right?
Urdiir the Guardian is awake, but the danger is past. We should depart before the great spirit turns its attention to us. We are intruders here, too, after all.\n\nLet us return to Vastyr and finish our talk there.
How intriguing. Even now you can feel the subtle vibrations shaking this island. So very much like Vvardenfell. Fascinating.\n\nI wonder, can you feel the island's movement?
How fares the task?\n\nIf my father resists, you may press the issue. Pain is a wonderful motivator, and really, I've been very patient.
Between you and me, I'm incredibly relieved that Emeric's here, but it took him so long, I don't know whether to kiss him or slap him.
Sharing the evidence you discovered at Fakimal's house, I was able to convince the other bailiffs to release me from the stocks. \n\nTell me though, what did you learn at the Magistrate's house?
I trust you've earned the duchess's confidence by now. That's good.\n\nHave you been able to learn why she was conspiring with her father?
Pascal's home isn't usually locked. You should be able to go right in.
These bootless louts have climbed into their own crypt.\n\nThere's no way out of this warehouse except through me, and that's not going to happen.
Who's there? Stay back. Wait. Is that you, Captain Rosalind?
That poor spriggan spirit is finally free. It is a lurcher no more. \n\nThrough its blood, we have cleansed this site. Everything is ready.
Find a way to get into the inn so I can make the antidote. \n\nMy cure may be the only way to truly save this city.
Arrogant Elves! They have so much faith in that seal they put on the main door, they don't even have anyone guarding the portal!\n\nI'm not complaining though. Are you ready to do this?
I can't wait to take these to Lady Laurent. She's going to be so pleased with me.\n\nI am heavily in your debt, and I won't forget it.
The Pearl is the Way and the Guide.\n\nIt is the light to the Far Shores and back again, as they are placed by Tall Papa's hand.
Please, wayfarer. I need your help. I was hired to guard a caravan out of Bergama, a family moving to Bangkorai.\n\nI am ashamed to confess it, but I failed to honor the contract. I abandoned them—all of them—down at the oasis.
Troll's blood! Do you need an invitation? Speak to Tanval.
You can see me, outsider!\n\nI beg you, help me.
My nix-hounds are nervous. They smell the Orcs in the pass.
I … can't hold him … much longer. Use the altar now!
I knew you'd help us. I just knew it!\n\nI'm going to see my egg-sister very soon.
You've slain three minions of the Worm Cult.\n\nDo you think that's all it takes?
I can't remember anything, though the cloud over my mind is gone. Now my memories lie in deep pools, inaccessible to me unless they bubble to the surface.
You're not real. You can't be! Get out of here. I have no time for illusions. I'm supposed to be dreaming.
We need the Stone complete to contain the Daedra, finish the Goblins—you have my thanks. I hope you fathom what you offer.\n\nIt seems Sir Edgard and his squad have returned—they found one stone piece, but there are others.
Good luck. Beware their blades. Even the inexperienced members of the Vanguard are deft swordsmen.\n\nOnce you've found what we're looking for, get back here and report to Denu. She'll know what to do.
Look what the Vanguard did. They confiscated my guar pen to hold their supplies. They scattered my poor guar and laughed. \n\nI'm too scared to go looking for them. What will I do now?
Namira, I revere thee! Namira, I serve thee!
Turn back, wanderer. The oasis isn't safe. Look what that creature did to my goat!\n\nI tell you, the gods look down and say, "Hram, you deserve a life of annoyance and inconvenience!"
What did <<1>> promise you in exchange for the supplies? There had to be something.
You honor Saint Veloth by your actions.
The Dwarves were quite creative! For such a godless race. Perhaps those stands could help us get past the doors?
Welcome back to the arms of the guild, comrade.
I'll stay here and try to figure out how this thing works.
Master of Apocrypha, I beseech you. Send us a weapon to wield against these invaders.\n\nOh, hello!
It will be a while before Feyne accepts my choice.
Thank you again for your time on the river. One day, I hope to soothe my scales in the mud of laughter.
You've saved us all, but the giants are gathering on the hill. The Worm Cult must have angered them. I just hope there isn't a stampede.
If you can stop to chat, your business must not be all that important.
Jofnir continues to aid us, even in death! I'll be right behind you, comrade.
I really enjoy these impromptu celebrations!
Ah, the smell of fresh blood. It's intoxicating. I only wish I had been the one to drain the life from their bodies.\n\nBut this is not about me. This is about sending a message. And Valeric has heard it, loud and clear.
Spinners don't usually write their tales down. I guess since this valley's been fought over many times, they wanted to keep their tales from fading. We're lucky these journals exist!
Thank Kyne! A familiar face. How did you know to come here, my friend?
Hero, huh? Good luck in the mines. The Reach are bloody-minded bastards.
They're stealing … my memories!
The spirits won't be appeased without a sacrifice of some kind.\n\nI don't believe they'll want a life for a life, but one must never be too careful.
Now for the portals.
Dirty work out there. Glad we have you on our side.
Quickly, go fetch Odvild. The poor woman is devastated. This will certainly lift her spirits.
This is the best party I've been to all night!
Divines be praised, a friendly face! I've been hiding out here since the Covenant ambushed my team. They took three prisoners. \n\nI tracked them to a nearby camp. I'd rescue them myself, but there's a slight wrinkle ….
The captain might've lost more than just his sight, but he's still a pirate at heart.
Just scoping out the competition. These amphibian idiots are no match for my Snooks.
I'll be fine. You take care of those bandits!
Told you chief would say yes! No hurt Byz!
Quickly, my new friend. Speak to Khali. We're in agreement. The signs are all there. You may yourself have an important role to play in the Two-Moons Dance.
It's time to see how tough you really are.
Hey, there you are! I remembered what you weren't supposed to do. \n\nBut you still have both your hands, so obviously you didn't do it!
What a rotten day.\n\nThe entire Merethic Society collection is stored in these ruins. And the Worm Cult gets to have their way with it all.
I meet you at last. I saw you defeat the scheming Redguard who rules Stros M'Kai. I see great events swirling about you.
I wish I could have retrieved that Ayleid relic for study, but you were wise to destroy it rather that place it in Breton hands.\n\nI realize Kaleen disagrees with your decision, but never doubt it was the right one.
Get off my ship before I throw you off.
Hail and welcome, comrade. How goes the fight?
Marvelous, isn't it? We'll have to construct a special room for <<Ac:1>> when we bring it back to the Mages Guild.\n\nI'm sorry, did you need something?
You have given us much to consider, outsider. Please return to the Moonless Walk. We shall come to you after a decision has been reached.
It's too late to change our minds now. Destroy those binding totems and leave us to our work!
Have a seat by the fire and let me know when you're ready to hear the story. Remember, ask nicely.
Oh! Ah … greetings, traveler. What can I do for you?
I don't know what <<1>> plans to do about these bandits, but I hope he does it soon.
Now here's one who I know is loyal to the king! It's good to see you again, my friend.\n\nYou're going to find this hard to believe, but the damned Imperials are here! They've seized control of the city—for the moment, at least.
We were able to overcome the vampiric snare of the Orchard. I expect we'll handle the Reaver Citadel with equal aplomb.
Excellent. Well done. A fantastic experiment, if I do say so myself.
Khalima's life would be unbearable without us.
Oh ho. Now, you have seen how the roles of hunter and hunted are interchangeable. You have stalked your prey and confronted your predator.\n\nYou are almost ready to become a Briar. One last trial remains.
The moons speak to Saifa. They tell her of your journey.
Don't stop now! We'll take care of things here.
No time for words now! Get moving!
Z'en's price! I knew if I banged on this door long enough someone would come.\n\nNever dreamed it'd be another Tree-Sapper, though. I'd ask how you ended up here, but I got more pressing matters. Can you spring me before the trolls come back?
So the Emerald Chalice turns ordinary people into green Goblins? Remarkable!
You travel with <<1>>? He has proven himself a friend to the Falinesti Faithful.\n\nThere are questions written upon your faces. What is it you seek?
He took the Walking City? He took my home?\n\nOr is this another of his lies?
This is Denille's last hope. If this fails, the worst is inevitable.
There was a time this place was nothin' but a game trail, if you believe it. Blacksaps used to ambush old coins not familiar with the Valenwood.\n\nThat's where I came in. Know these woods like the back of my hand. Blacksaps never saw us comin'.
The time has come to crown a ruler of Rivenspire. The Light shines on us all, but a nation needs a single leader to look up to.
May Arkay's light guide you on your journey.
So, you're to kill Brinarch? Good. Tamriel will be better for it.
Fear not, Vestige. When Sai Sahan and the others return, we will slip into the shadow of Sancre Tor and retrieve the Amulet of Kings.
Fortunately, I'm on the stealthy side. That's not Snaruga's way, though.\n\nThe old girl gave the Imperials too many black eyes. They dare not trust her with a pick!
I think I'm ready to swing a sword again.
Can you believe this? The fool's turned himself into iron!\n\nIt's like a practical joke. I keep expecting my boss to step out from behind a rock and just tell me he wanted to see how I'd react. I'd carry the bastard if he wasn't so damn heavy.
How are you doing, milksop? Kill any big scary monsters this week?
I didn't have time to explore when we were here last. It's far larger than I realized.\n\nWho knows what treasures may rest within these ruins? The Ayleids have always been such a mystery.
It seems our troubles never end. First, the mad king sends us to war against Wayrest. And now the nobles who are supposed to protect us are fighting against each other.\n\nWill it never end?
Ah! Oh! Oh … you're … not who I thought you were.\n\nI'd clear out, stranger. Spiders in this cave. Lots and lots of spiders!
These Covenant soldiers are prickly sons of bitches. But we'll hold them back.\n\nI'm sure of it.
We'll calm the water here for a while longer and mend what wounds we can. Return after you've found my missing guards and I'll pay you for your trouble.
Hmm. I smell something intriguing. Something … interesting ….\n\nWait. No. Don't tell me. It smells like … it smells like … a dead bird?
I pray <<1>> returns safe and sound.\n\nMaybe with some new battle scars … the kind a chief would notice.
Damn moot! First the king invites outsiders and now this! It's no wonder we don't have any rooms left to rent!\n\nPlenty to eat and drink downstairs, though, so feel free to go and bother the bartender.
Flies and I will sneak out of here and go warn Chief Bazrag. We'll see you back in the city!
<<1>>'s tomb was to remain buried under ice until a true hero of Wrothgar walked the land. Now you disturb the dust in her resting place.\n\nWhy are you here?
Good work. In time, we shall know all the Worm Cult's plans. We'll hit them where it hurts.
I'm glad you're here.\n\nEveli has entered a deep sleep. I don't know when or if she'll come out of it. But I'll stay at her side, no matter how long it takes. I just hope that Trinimac hears my prayers.
No sad faces. Not in here. This was Kurog's happy place, and that's how it's going to stay!\n\nTo Kurog! To Orsinium! May the city always remember the kind and gentle king who cared for his people. Everything else … that was his mother's fault.
It's done, yes? That machine is destroyed? Hope you didn't break a blade on that thing. Ugh. Dwarves.\n\nBirkhu's been asking after you. You should settle accounts with him before he passes out.
Ah, there you are! You'll be on your way to Zthenganaz soon, yes? I'm sorry if I seem impatient. I'm just anxious to begin these new experiments in earnest. The last one was … explosive.\n\nDon't look at me like that. You aren't my sister!
I appreciate you not slaughtering everyone in there. A holy bloodbath wouldn't have served us any better than you getting your head chopped off.\n\nUnfortunately, Josseline is as slippery as I am. She snuck away before we had a chance to talk.
This place is nice, but it's not a home. It feels like I'm hiding down here. People like us, we need powerful friends if we're going to make it in this world.
There's something happening at the Sanctuary. That old crow, the Speaker, he asked for you specifically.
My matron used to say I had some Iron Orc blood running through my veins. I guess they wanted it back.
The triggers will summon a bridge of Aetherial energy. It can only be activated in the presence of Celestial power. That means Cassipia is close to achieving her goals.
I feel like I spent an evening drinking with the heroes of Sovngarde—and then they danced on my head.
You're back! My Mistress and I feared the worst. Is it over? Is Savarak slain?
It looks like you cleared a path through the debris and rescued my trapped workers. Thanks for that.\n\nFeel free to take the Blessing Stone. We'll begin making repairs to the damaged areas shortly.
Keep your wits around Savarak. He's slippery as a slaughterfish and twice as deadly.
A word of advice. Never go into the egg mining business.
Eoki berated me because the Zalkin-Sul cave-in killed some miners.\n\nYou stole the prism to save us from Magister Gothren. I suffered humiliation in a cage while you did what was necessary. Is that so wrong?
I appreciate you agreeing to see what you can learn at Arenim Manor. My father used to say it was used by councilors as a retreat, but Mother always told me it was where they conducted business that required a certain degree of privacy.
Unusual for the governor to omit items from the official record, but I'm just her clerk.\n\nYou'd better head inside and talk to the governor now.
I'll get the others. You hurry off to Slag Town!
Strange. I spent lifetimes here in the world of tangible-forms, but each time I emerge from the throne, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time.\n\nBroken, impoverished … beautiful.
Bright moons! A fellow child of the khaj! Welcome! Welcome! Na'jhargo is always glad to see a whiskered face in this silly metal city.\n\nIf you search for salvage, you have come to the right place. What can this one get you?
My apprentice wishes to speak to you.
I owe you a debt of gratitude, friend of Valsirenn. What the two of you did to help me, that was a step beyond. Thank you.\n\nAnd it seems you accomplished what I failed to do. You ended the threat of K'Tora.
Best talk to Mother. She'll sort this all out, no question.
When Pandermalion's soldiers told me he'd returned to the keep with a passerby, I thought he'd lost his mind. What were you thinking?
See? Nothing to find. Please, if you see my boy, tell him to come home.
The Thieves Guild send you? Hmph. Wouldn't go any deeper if I were you. Darkness crawls along the walls of Eton Nir. Only thing you'll find here is an ugly death.\n\nThat, and the corpse of my former apprentice. Most likely.
A Keeper? No … no an intruder. Did you not hear the shrieks? The groaning admonitions? This is a cruel and sour place, outsider. Your beating heart mocks the dead.
The Sapiarch's letter. She's hidden a coded message in the words. Raz has seen this done before.
You must move quickly. The pearl is with Justiciar Avanaire, somewhere in Tor-Hame-Khard. Once you find it, destroy the cursed thing. \n\nEven if you have to go through Avanaire to do it.
You're a kind soul. Be careful, we've lost a lot of kind souls of late.\n\nThat pushy noble, Faidur, might know something about that. He arrived not long ago claiming to own the place. Certainly acts the part.
You've gotten your prediction, as promised. Now get going. All your shouting is ruining my peace and quiet.
Do not dwell on what has transpired. We cannot change the past, but we can guide the course of our future. The Hist will always steer us true.
Ranja's method of opening doors is not so dramatic as this, but she thinks it's more elegant.
I have an uneasy feeling about this ceremony.\n\nStill, it would be unwise to ignore Sulahkeesh's judgement at this point. Especially given that I'm the one who sought out such a judgement in the first place.
Be careful with that grave-stake, traveler. It took Tun-Zee many years to carve it.
I see the glimmer and shine of victory in your eyes. You must have located the hidden dowry!\n\nI am glad for you, and lift my broom to your success.
It does my heart good to see you unharmed. I trust the Nereid suffers no longer?
Old Aneshi doesn't get many visitors, friend. Few find much comfort in the ancient tales of Khunzar-ri during these trying times.\n\nWait. Aneshi recognizes your friend! She is grown now, more serious, but this one knows Princess Khamira, by Jode!
The orb is sustaining the Aurorans! You have to find a way to destroy it or they'll be unstoppable.
You're the adventurer who helped Abnur Tharn and Khamira at the Halls of Colossus? The battlemage has been waiting for you.\n\nBut where are my manners? Welcome to Riverhold and the province Anequina. I am the Speaker of the Mane.
Go on! You should have the honor of completing the Rithana-di-Renada. After all, it was you who restored it.
You have the singing crystal, thank Jone and Jode! I was afraid you would fail and invite Rajhin's wrath upon us all.
You look like you could be handy against Dragons. Let's talk.
Did you come to share this lizard with Sanzagh? You can have the neck. Maybe a hind leg if you're lucky.
This doesn't sound good. We need to get down there and try to protect Yahgrondu!
Ah, five-claw, you arrive in the nick of time. While I deal with my royal protectors, I have an important task for you.
I just need some rest. Thank you for helping me.\n\nPerhaps I can find a place to lie down. Just a moment's rest is all I need.
Ha! They said my concoction wouldn't work in Elsweyr, but Vigwenn proves the doubters wrong yet again!
I am neither jarl nor thane, but Svana asked me to come to Solitude to help petition the high king.\n\nHe may not listen to me, but I'll do what I can to aid the princess.
Let's search these halls and see if we can find out what Lady Essenia is doing here.
Fenn is with Old Mjolen at the Mages Guild. When you're finished with him, join me in the courtyard of the Blue Palace. I'm going to hold a moment of remembrance for this city. We all need a moment to mourn what we lost.
I can't tell if Rada al-Saran is playing with Count Verandis's emotions or is totally serious with these offers.\n\nPlease, see how my father fares.
That magnificent bastard really did it. He brought them back.
Adusa supposes that outfit will work. Provided Boss Trenlor and his court are suitably intoxicated by the time you walk in.
I've been watching, but Lady Belain hasn't returned to Understone Keep yet. I wonder how the ard plans to deal with her.\n\nSpeaking of Ard Caddach, will he meet with me now? Will he help us stop Rada al-Saran and the Gray Host?
Welcome to the Ravenwatch. I suppose that makes me your superior now. I'll try not to let it go to my head.\n\nI actually have your first assignment, if you're ready.
No sign of Lyranth down there. And I can't tell if my father is among the captives. We must get down there fast.
Whatever you and the duplicates did, it worked. The main doors unlocked with an audible click.\n\nBefore we rush in and attempt to deal with the sorcerer, we should discuss our options. I discovered something unsettling in the ancient carvings.
A missing servant? I wonder what that's all about?\n\nWell, let's head into the watchtower and talk to Councilor Abor. Hopefully it won't take a lot to convince her to return to Leyawiin with us.
Bastian doesn't seem very fond of Quistley. I can't imagine why. \n\nWe compared notes while you were talking with that simpering idiot. Bastian said he might have an idea that would solve things for both of us.
All right, you heard Lovidicus. Time to get back to work. While the councilors stay safe in Leyawiin Castle and wait for the scribe to arrive, we need to find out what the Dark Brotherhood is actually up to.\n\nShow me that letter you found in Gideon.
So what shall it be? How would you like to conclude our transaction? Will you be paying in gold or would you rather make the trade?
Tell me the truth. Do I look ridiculous? No. Never mind. Let's just get on with this.
An outsider entering my home unbidden seeks death. You only live because the annoying blacksmith who joins you is familiar to me. But this pause is a temporary state.\n\nSpeak, then. What is so urgent that you would break into my home?
Those are Elossi's famous twin daggers. She claims they possess all of the speed and venom of a striking viper. Deadly in her hands.\n\nLet us get those back to her quickly.
Normally I love new experiences. It's why I got into exploring. Not that one. Never, ever again.
Mercenary, you are to report to Leyawiin Castle at once!
So? Did you just return the Shade Sickle? Is my lady appeased?
My powers are gone. I'm honestly relieved. Having all of the Ambitions' abilities inside me at once made it feel like my head was going to split. \n\nI doubt Lyranth took them for my benefit, however.
See for yourself, my friend! The stage is set. The oblivious inebriates are gathered in befuddled groups. And the minstrels are so warmed up they're practically cooked. \n\nThe time has come for merriment!
Oh! Did the Saraathu Tong hire you? Excellent! \n\nLet's talk. Which of my projects did you get hired to help with?
I don't have time for dawdlers. Get the location of the portal from Skoedal and retrieve Uxark's hidden treasure.
Quickly! Use the sundial!
The Waking Flame cultists make bedfellows with Mehrunes Dagon and his legions, and then they're surprised when they wake up with a knife at their throat? They get no sympathy from me.
Excellent work, rescuing the Prince. The Skald-King and his son can be … well. Insufferable. \n\nBut these talks deserve a real chance. And you've given that to us.
A good day for diplomacy, yes? Nobody died or went to prison, and the innkeeper was paid in the end. Now, would you talk to <<1>> about my scepter of office?\n\nI think she is still a little mad at me.
The food here is greasy and the portions small. Just pretend I raved about it if you are asked.
My friend! May I count you as my friend? You're very dear to Isobel, and she's very dear to me so … ahem.\n\nI'm very glad you both could make it.
Two crystals smashed to pieces. I don't want to get my hopes up, but we haven't died yet.\n\nLet's take care of the last two so I don't have to worry about drowning in a rising pool of lava.
What's the connection here? Why does the Ascendant Order care about this place? And why does Lord Bacaro have a suit of the Ascendant Lord's armor?
Urgent whispering. Metal skin. Waits. Waits
Have you heard the rumors? That Ascendant Order knights have been seen on Galen?\n\nWhy can't those rogues go back to High Isle? Haven't we had enough trouble for one season?
Wait! What about Rozenn! Was that real, or was it just a dream?\n\nWhere is she? Do you know? I think it was real. You! You have to help me!
Now that we got the crew out safely, next order of business is to get back to sea.\n\nI'm betting we'll have better luck finding a ship in Wayrest than back in that little village.
If the Magistrate was somehow involved in this, she must be brought to justice!
You did it. You killed Faolchu.
The cure won't work unless the werewolves are weakened first. \n\nRemember. Weaken them, then use the antidote. Send anyone who's cured back here.
I watched you rummaging around out there in the ruins. If you had been in trouble, I would've had your back, just so you know.\n\nI'm guessing you've gathered all the tools by now?
I sometimes wonder whether <<1>>'s found the sword already and hasn't told me.\n\nNo, he hasn't the wit to keep such a treasure secret.
His soldiers are dead! \n\nHead down the trapdoor in the tower to look for Strikes-from-Shadows. That old fetcher would never fall to the likes of those Covenant scum.
Cracking through the husk of a fallen legend, your own tale will begin to grow tall and strong.
This is justice, that the blood of fallen Nedes will open the way for their defeat.\n\nGo, soldier! Kill the troops and slay Ornskar. Then report at the ritual altar.
<<1>> told me to expect you, but …. Wait, something's off. Beyond your flesh and blood, I mean.\n\nZ'en's blessings! The curse upon you is temporary. You can safely recover the <<z:2>>!
Why do you delay? Seize the coal in your grasp.
<<1>> asked us to watch the southerly approach. The Dominion seemed determined to get to <<2>>, no matter the cost. The vicecanon took it upon herself to find out why.
Just smell that. Sizzling red meat. Real Nord food!
You have restored tranquility here, and I hesitate to ask more, but I have no choice.\n\nAnother of Ysgramor's companions—Valdur—he was entombed not far from here in Taarengrav. It is likely the Worm Cult seeks to enslave his spirit as well.
With the Pact working together again, we should be able to sniff out Fildgor's spies easily enough.\n\nNow my only concern is for the King. He's surrounded himself with our strongest warriors, but the element of surprise gives Fildgor an advantage.
Good to meet you! You fought beside the Centurion at Shor's, yeah? Amazing!
Your actions won't be forgotten, so long as our roots touch earth.
Lucius isn't with you. Tell me you didn't find him yet.
Please, you must do something. Father will listen to you.
Heartblood? No, I can't. I couldn't do that!
Speak quickly, please. This could be very bad for both of us.
Go. Prove your worth.
Don't you dare break the captain's heart. You don't understand what he's been through. No one does.
Keep him safe down there, please. The Rilis line is strewn with hard hearts and cruel men.
Mmm, those chickens smell delicious, dearie.
Look, Haskill! Forky's back! It's so nice to see him again!\n\nOh. And good to see you too, mortal. I guess.
You've impressed me. That don't happen often.
Chief Tazgol must know of your discoveries before he marches on Carzog's Demise. We have ignored the Bloodthorn threat for too long. It may already be too late.
I'm certain the cook bambedazzled me! But a bet's a bet.
Enter this Lightless Oubliette. Draw upon the Light of Meridia to protect you. It can disrupt the darkness that shall seek to slow you down.\n\nThen move the crystals to gain access to my prison. This strategy shall succeed. I am certain of it!
Look, there he is! I'll follow your lead.
Give me a moment to collect myself. I'll be right behind you.
Lorkhan take them all! Why does <<c:1>> negotiate with these filthy Maormer?
It took a bit of work, but we finally stabilized the portals. Our people aren't getting scattered hither and yon every time they travel to Coldharbour any more.\n\nAt least, not as long as they're traveling to the Hollow City.
Bright moons and sharp claws, thank you!
My blade has tasted the blood of my mother's killer. I should feel happy, righteous … but I don't feel anything.
Nnnnn! Please … hurry! I can't hold this spell forever!
There must be another way into the caves. Perhaps there's a passage near the cliff walls?
Damn it all! I can't believe you're finding me like this again! It was humiliating enough the last time!\n\nThere's no time for jests, though. The Withered Hand has stolen back the Ansei Wards we recovered! They have all three again!
We must remain vigilant. I don't know what's gone wrong, but it's clear that something has upset the boss, <<1>>.\n\nJust a guess, but I bet it's all these spiders.
If you are looking for evidence, I'd suggest looking around in town. When the forest turned against us, there was no time for anyone to collect their belongings—or cover their tracks.
I still think Gathiel must have had some part of this, but I guess the evidence speaks.
If you are looking for custom jewelry, you should know I'm retired.
Greetings. Normally I would take pride in telling you that I am the most worldly Baandari merchant in all Tamriel.\n\nI would present you with a lavish display of the amazing variety of goods I have to offer, but I cannot do that today.
You're going to cleanse the mausoleums? Arkay be with you, my friend.\n\nIf this does not succeed, I'm afraid we have little recourse.
Ah, another visitor. You should probably speak to my lady. You can find her over by the cave entrance.\n\nAs usual, she could use a bit of assistance.
I can't believe it. What Nedras did for me. He was always looking out for me ….
Do what you will.
You're back? Thank the gods! The walls of this crypt are closing in on me now. Ever since I realized I might die in here. Funny how the mind does that.\n\nDid you find my pack though? Did you find the letter?
I never should have brought everyone here. I should have handled this on my own.\n\nYou're in danger as well. Montclair will eventually try to use you against me.
You know, I don't think Varon Davel is who he claims to be. But at least he took charge after the councilor disappeared.
You did it! With the beams activated, we should be able to enter the temple now.
Once both ritual sites on either side are disabled, we'll be able to make it across. Or so Gilraen tells me.\n\nSplit up if you have to.
Welcome to the Undaunted enclave!
Stay back! I'll—oh, you're not one of them. By Tava's red feathers, these Daedra are everywhere, and I'm in no condition to fight.
Ever met a Riekr? I hate those sneaky little bastards ….
Hm. Interesting. You are peculiar, aren't you? Something faintly Daedric about you, yet you appear to be a creature of the Mundus, like myself. \n\nPerhaps even somewhat intelligent? Tell me, are you familiar with the Xivkyn?
Well, you look no worse for the wear. Are you feeling all right? Maybe I can use you.
Keep walking, friend. I'm down to three hide sites, and I'm not about to give up another.
The Order of Diagna shall fight beside my Knights of the Dragon. Truly, a good day. Wouldn't you agree … Tamahl, was it? Am I saying that correctly?
Go on ahead. I'm going to read these scrolls and choose a blessing before we start this trial.
About time you showed up!\n\nHey, where's Owayine? No, don't tell me. I already know.
These cultists must be taught that Wrothgar is off limits. Once you've crushed their operation, check in with Lilyameh. Her order will reward you for the effort.
So you're the new recruit, huh? No, don't tell me your name. I'll just call you New-blade. It's easier to remember and it's not like I'm going to know you for very long.\n\nYes, New-blade. That's so much better.
Arkay watch over you, child.
Sorry. As much as I like to chat with my adoring public, I have to keep working or I'll never finish these cakes on time. Everyone has an occasion that's special, you know.\n\nNow if you happen to have a cake voucher, well, then we could talk.
Sorry, I grew tired of waiting. I received more than a few sideward glances on my way over. What happened in there?
Did Ashur send you to check up on me? I swear, the next person that treats me like a child is going to find my dagger in their stomach!\n\nGods, I'm not mad at you. I'm just annoyed at everybody right now!
Just be careful, all right? This place seethes with Daedric energy. I see … golden horns, suspended from gossamer strands. All covered in blood.\n\nI fear I'll see much worse before this adventure ends.
As far as the official record is concerned, you don't exist. So forgive me if I don't engage in conversation. I'm extremely busy at the moment.
You look a bit lost, friend. Can I help you find a book?
Follow this road to the Brass Fortress. When you see the wayshrine, veer north … or what passes for north here.\n\nIf you have other business to attend to, I'll not stop you. Just meet me at the gates to the fortress when you're ready to proceed.
Stay alert, five-claw. Raz has heard Psijics turn people into chickens and make them explode. To die covered in feathers instead of fur, such a horrible demise.\n\nIn the meantime, Raz will send Avinisse home until the Proxy Queen renders judgment.
I couldn't breathe! As usual, you found me just in the nick of time.\n\nThe beast that captured me. I've never seen anything like it!
I would appreciate it if you kept this matter to yourself. If word got out that our procedures are imperfect, well … that would be a very inauspicious day. For everyone.
I'll meet you outside when you've finished.
Val and the Psijics, they're too set in their ways. We need a better plan.\n\nI'll return to Artaeum with her, because Meridia told me to cooperate. But as soon as I think of something more effective, I'll let you know.
Just look at this architecture! And art! Oh, I just don't know where to begin. What should we drink in first?
These are perfect! Exactly what I needed! Now I can use these to … to … of course!\n\nStand back! With these particles, I can finally understand the meaning of these magnificent tomes!
I'm sorry, but I have no time to speak at the moment. There are injured people here that require my assistance. \n\nIf you wish to help, go speak with Welkynar Olorime. She may have a task for you.
The outsider returns. Just in time to see the disgrace that clings to me like the mist that rises from the swamp.\n\nBut what of my egg-son? Does Kishi still live?
I fill my lungs. I always imagined I would fall in a spray of curses and blood, but I see now that my passing will be unlike any Dead-Water warrior before me. Quiet, but glorious all the same.\n\nI was born to die for my people. The duty is mine.
What a resounding victory! Keep this up, and we'll have Seeks free in no time.\n\nNow, the next arena is called the Hall of Beasts. Keep on your toes, all right? I heard that Tames-the-Beast has all sorts of nasty tricks up his sleeve.
I am once more indebted to you, beeko.\n\nShould Paraxeeh grow suspicious, tell him I wish to write about the ritual in my newest book. That should suffice.
I erect the spine of awkward greetings. Perhaps you are lost?\n\nThis is the storehouse, ojel. Nothing but carefully organized goods and crafts here. You would find far more amusing things to occupy yourself with outside, I think.
Beehuna of the Root-House smiles shiftily. She has no doubt taken something of worth, but she has stopped pouting, so I will not complain.\n\nAll that is left is the suitor of the Moss-Skins. They are never difficult. I don't know why he delays.
If you hurry, you can find Xukas by the Swallowed Grove. Moons guide you.
You helped give my people hope, five-claw. That is a debt I will be hard pressed to repay.\n\nLet us consult with Lord Gharesh-ri and Abnur Tharn. We have the rest of this war to plan out, not to mention Kaalgrontiid and the Dragons to deal with.
I think I understand. Not only do I hear the Moons sing, but I hear my ancestor, Anequina. The very walls echo with her memories. Good ones. Bad ones like the actions of the Betrayer.\n\nThey tell me we must seek the temple sanctuary to stop him.
This is good meat. Rakhzargo would offer you some, but he dropped it earlier.
This tomb is closer to our destination, but we move on. Jora-ri feels the Moons pulling his spirit. He hears his wife calling his name.
The great Tharn awaits you in Riverhold's K'har Zhab Hall. You will recognize him by his proud stance, his regal brow, and his penetrating eyes.\n\nAnd his air of authority. He wears it proudly like a Khajiit wears fur.
What are you speaking with Sidura for? Sai Sahan is waiting for you back at the sanctum. You should head there at once.
Thank you for everything, walker. Malahbu will admit, he had his doubts. But do not feel slighted. Malahbu has doubts about everything!
I don't know you. I don't want to know you. Get lost.
Good to see you. Now work your magic before I have to teach these western Nords some manners.
So you found Freiwen alive did you? An unexpected, but welcome turn of events. We may yet be able to save her.\n\nWhat did you bring me from the ruins? I must know more about the necromancer's plans.
Wow, you're the last person I expected to see down here. But, you have impeccable timing!\n\nAdusa's in trouble. You remember her, right? One of the vampires of the Ravenwatch. From Rivenspire? Anyway, she entered Greymoor Keep and hasn't returned.
The Dark Heart. A piece of the primal Void trapped in our world. No wonder it warps the very weave of existence all around it.\n\nLook up. We're directly beneath the Library of Arkthzand. The Dark Heart, it powers the orrery. But to what end?
You go on ahead. Fenn and Gwendis could use a moment. I'll make sure they make it to Markarth safely.
Hey, you're an outsider. I guess when the ard made us put up those scratchings he called signs, it really worked. Attracted you right to my business.\n\nUnfortunately, we're closed right now. Come back later. And bring your gold!
Every moment that tree stands is a moment the Thornroot Hagravens can use to create a new briarheart.
Finally, proof of Phalevon's legend! I'll be the talk of Gideon once I bring these trophies home.\n\nAnd yet … I wonder. Did the Goblins here cause their own troubles by meddling with Phalevon's horn? Or is it dangerous to just keep around?
So, what did we learn?\n\nCouncilor Abor was frightened, but that's understandable. Interesting that she was burning documents. Her journal indicated that she knew more than the others. And Talaise visited the pantry before heading to the watchtower.
Be cautious on the roads. Something dark is brewing in Leyawiin.
That creature had the sense to flee. Did it value its life, or was it protecting the power it had siphoned away from this vessel?\n\nEither way, if we continue to destroy these Agonymium Stones it'll reduce the threat they pose.
I don't mean to be short, it's just that I am very busy today. So if you don't need to talk to me, please just go away.
Caska took such great strides getting here, Za'ji can't help but feel she was trying to strain his poor legs.\n\nZa'ji was built for grace, not speed!
Not what I expected, but then nothing about this journey has been thus far. The Banekin's—er, Master Rrvenk's—voice comes through clearly, but I don't understand. He's telling me he can't correct my alignment with this realm!
I thought it might be good if a group of Dremora warriors sheltered here. Keep things like monsters and scavengers from troubling us. But now that I see them sharpening their blades, I think they might draw new troubles here.
Again, we are successful and our efforts are complete. Thank you!\n\nZenithar created a channel through which our paths cross, season after season. Continue learning your trades. Your skill is already much improved for your efforts.
I knew it'd be hot in here, but this is unreasonable. Did Tarrinore even bring water with her?\n\nLet's find my wife and the scoria we need. Quickly!
That powder will do the job. Just sprinkle a pinch over each of the alliance medallions and it will return them to their original state. Only the protective magic of the invitations will remain.
Like my new outfit? What better way to search Amenos Station than disguised as a jailer? \n\nI'll see what I can learn about our missing royals here in the stockade and around town. You head to the jungle. From what I already heard, you need to hurry.
You never think when they send you to prison that you'll be hunted to death. It's just not something they tell you about.
This is definitely Sword's Rest, but where are the Lion Guard? Something's very wrong here.\n\nLet's look around and find Lady Arabelle.
Now's your chance. Find the prince. We'll cause a distraction to draw away as many Serpents as we can! Then we'll find a good place to cast my ritual and clear the storm for your ship.
We need to save Song! Don't waste time talking to me!
Attacked? Here in the Earthen Root Enclave? This can't be happening.
To help me evaluate my suggested itinerary, I'd like you to sample some local cuisine here in the Gaming Hall.\n\nThen, visit fishing holes and scenic spots around High Isle and Amenos. I'll mark locations on your map. We'll add the best to the tour.
I must not let my forces move outside of Vastyr until Stefan is safe. But a mainland mercenary might be able to do the job my knights can't.\n\nRemember, I am trusting you with my son's life.
I've been cooking and cleaning for the countess for six years. I can't understand why she would send me away.\n\nI'm not going to leave town though. I'm hoping she'll realize she's made a mistake.
We can help once you get those nobles out. My guards are itching to hunt down those brigands. Just be careful. And good luck.
Did you get the pillars activated? As soon as you do, I'll sneak around and meet you in the lower ruins.
Why … what happened? My head hurts.
Medya allowed her son to kill Sir Etienne, but you are right in requiring a trial before she is put to death.\n\nEvermore's people need to hear from her own traitor's lips what happened here—and why it happened!
I am finally free!
Find Rhavil's house. I'll follow your progress through the spell I cast on you.
The firesap gel used to be Hist-Tender's. Alas, he has rejoined the One.\n\nFind the gel in the camp. Look for a rucksack. That might have it.
On my life, I'll make sure this Hlaalu Elf gets out of here safely.
<<1>> says you're no skin-stealer. Please forgive my manners before.
I just wanted to make sure you were all right. I swear!
The Egg must get to Mournhold. It's a symbol of our commitment to the Dunmer and the Nord, allies we sorely need in these times.
<<AC:1>> must be prepared for travel. All must be merriment and good cheer!
I can't believe this. It happened so fast.
Blood for the Pact!
Well? Don't just stand there staring at me. I'm very busy and I don't have time to play seven questions.
I'll stay here for a little while to fully recover my magicka. Thanks to you, I can shield us from enemies until then.
So much remains to be done before <<1>> is safe.
Estre is vulnerable. But Tamriel is still open to the Deadlands. This must not be.\n\nWe must close her gates. End the threat of the Daedra.
Are you going to help me or not?
The Prophet!\n\nHe's a prisoner here, too. It was very dangerous for him to speak to you, even for a moment. He must think you can help me.
Welcome to <<1>>. What can I do for you?
You have outwitted or outfought the wayward Justiciars, no? You could not stand here otherwise.\n\n I, Bakkhara, wonder if you will lend me your skills. Great danger awaits below.
Don't worry. A Proctor remembers those who were useful.
<<1>> and I have a long journey ahead of us. In time, I hope she'll warm to me. I'm not a bad person. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll have to keep a better eye on her.
The gods are fickle and not known for their patience. Please deliver those petitions.
Yes? Do you have something for me?
Great! <<1>> knows I have my treats. Why were you so obvious when you handed me the pouch?
This one has found it is best not to keep Shuzura waiting.\n\nHe is just saying.
The Daggers will find another way to get our start. Breaking the law for some pompous noble isn't how we'll get our reputation.\n\nJust keep Diel busy and I'll handle the rest.
Go! Travel to Moonmont, the ancient temple. You will learn what must come next, yes? Yes.
You keep up nicely! I can't abide dawdlers.
Deal with that bear as soon as you can. One fewer hungry mouth around here would be a good thing.
We've taken <<1>> into custody, thanks to your quick action. No treaty will keep him from proper justice.
There's a slight delay in my division's fights right now. Come back soon and we'll be ready for you.
Guide the Lunar Champions well, Moon Hallowed.
Incredible. I've never seen such terrible power. But you didn't flinch.\n\nThe Shade is gone, but his corruption is not. Look at the Heart. It's overflowing with corruption, spreading the darkness all over Valenwood.
Ah, you must be the one Ayrenn is waiting for.
Intractable fools. Their pride will see us all dead.
I think they all did it. All of them, collaborating with one another, broke the Green Pact intentionally. The real question is why.\n\nObviously they wanted the forest to attack us, to distract us from their real purpose. Think about it.
If you have business in <<1>>, you'd best turn back. The people are killing one another in the streets.
I can't believe my eyes. You hold it in your hands!\n\nNow, to break my bonds from this horrid prison.
Luck be with you.\n\nWe'll journey to the Evermore camp if you complete the job. We're closely tied to the land, so we'll know when you've been successful.
Well, that was surprising. At least she is gone now—right, <<1>>? \n\nThat was a clever approach, telling that guard the truth. She wasn't expecting that, was she?
Good. Four hunters is better than three, any day.
Keep low, and remain vigilant. The Imperials are thieves without honor.
The Scaled Court tore us to pieces.
You have the look of someone who has places to go and people to see. Is there something I can do for you, friend?
If you can determine the proper order of the story these panels tell, that's probably the key to solving the puzzle!
Do you think that scroll was left for me?
Just head downstairs and place the helmet in the proper display.\n\nWhen you're finished, come back and we can discuss your future involvement with the museum.
Welcome to the grand Orsinium! I'm the master mason, responsible for all of the construction you see going on around the city.
Velsa knows me so well! This one is as tired as a tiger with a belly full of tender meat.\n\nCome back and we can talk later, my friend.
If three of us survive, we'll be a greater success than the previous failed attempt.\n\n"Progress."
Now that it's all over, I feel like a fool for listening to the Chanter. I might have to pay him a visit one of these nights and even the score.
You should keep moving. These ruins are crawling with Iron Orcs. They beat the sap out of us and dragged off half my guards.\n\nIron Orcs have always been dangerous, but now … I just don't know.
Mother should be at home, ordering the servants about and taking care of the family business.\n\nYou should go and ask her about buying Tirwin.
You have your task. Complete it and you will have the favor of House Hlaalu. You are free to refuse if your stomach isn't in it, but I will expect your complete silence on this entire affair.
Are those murmurs of approval I hear? Well done, my friend. I'm sure the Wise Women will speak to you now.\n\nAsani Atal probably knows the most about this area. I doubt she'll offer more than faint praise. You'll have to ask about the tomb outright.
So which soldiers are we talking about? I know most of the people my brother used to work with.\n\nEyewitnesses are better than notes in the House Registry—provided I can actually get them to talk to me.
Ah, I hoped to see you again, assistant. Pray tell, what did Divayth Fyr have to say?\n\nI fear that he and I might have gotten off to a poor start. Did he ask about me? Any mention of my many exploits?
Look for Guard Milerond near the Lillandril docks. From everything I've heard, he's an honest, upright fellow. If you tell him you're looking into Haladan's murder, he'll provide all the answers he can.
Has—has she left? Has Rinyde departed for Lillandril?
Thank you for looking into this, ceruval. I just hope we're not too late ….
I knew this wasn't going to work. Speeding up the Sapiarch ritual was a long shot, at best.\n\nWe should have had the Conclave working on a solution all along. The Psijics could have figured out how to attune the Resolute Diamonds.
Wouldn't go any deeper if I were you, dryskin. Darkness crawls along the walls of Eton Nir. Only thing you'll find here is an ugly death.\n\nThat, and the corpse of my former apprentice. Most likely.
You're the first thing I've encountered that isn't a slavering beast or drooling savage. Begs the question what you're doing out here. Did that idiot Mehdze send you?
Such accommodations! The life of a scholar seems so much more luxurious than what this Eye of the Queen is used to.\n\nMaybe Raz's next career will involve dusty scrolls and books, yes?
Please, don't keep Kassandra waiting. She's eager to meet you!
I spread my truth-spines. All doubt is dead. The Hist's will is clear.
Please, find Ree-Nakal. Every moment we waste is torture for my children.
Don't look so shocked. My Irregulars are very good at what they do. It was simple enough for them to sneak in and set me free.\n\nNow, what did you learn from the report? Anything that will help us stop Captain Saulinia and her assassination squad?
You never know what you're missing until it's gone. I'm just glad to have that old bit of me back where it belongs!\n\nWhat say we go and find the rest?
Do you mind? I'm trying to eat here.
Rajhin's Shadow! Here in our museum! I cannot believe it.\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Trust me, you do not wish to make the avatar of a trickster god impatient.
So much to do, so little to do it with. Moons give us strength!
You talk to the ghost cat. It seems to know you.
You need to hurry back to the sanctum! That nasty Dragon cult plans to attack Pridehome, and Sai Sahan wants us to defend the temple.
Let's make our way to the next chamber. With any luck, we'll find Nahfahlaar there.
Mother wrote a letter to Pridehome's Clan Mother! Don't believe me? Look for yourself!
By Kyne, it's great to see you.\n\nWay I hear it, you've kept very busy since that business in Coldharbour. It's good to know I'm not the only Companion still kicking down witches' doors and freezing her arse off.
Nahfahlaar may have dissuaded the Dragons from aiding Kaalgrontiid, but who knew he could call forth spirits of Dark Aeon to fight for him?\n\nBetween them and the remaining cultists, we're certainly working up a sweat!
Viggol? He's alive?\n\nOf all the ludicrous stunts to pull. I can't believe I shed tears over him!
Arana needs to speak to you.\n\nDon't worry. I'll be around after you finish. I've got news, too, but it can wait.
It was only a matter of time before Rada and I crossed paths again. I just didn't think it would be this soon.
There was no reason for another member of the clan to die, but Freyleth refuses to see it that way. Still, we need to press on.\n\nWere you successful? Did you find a darkcap mushroom?
If I knew we were to wait here this long, I'd have brought more provisions with me.
The chief-of-chiefs certainly looks perturbed. How did your talk with her go? Did you make a decision?
This is the perfect place to test my mettle. There are many adventures to be had!
Well, now I feel the fool. I made you all worry. Dragged you into this mess. Sorry to be such a pain in the arse, as my daughter would put it.
Place that lucent in one of the discharge labrums.
Away to the Collector's villa, little mortal. I want to hear more about the Anchorite and her missing memories. She has suddenly become more interesting. We will be along shortly.
I must meditate on this. It is mine, but I gave it away. I must have had good reason.
Thank you for assisting Isobel. I'm so grateful to you both.\n\nAspirant Mortens came by not that long ago and told me he already had a honeymoon trip planned! The audacity!
I left mercenary work behind a long time ago. Got a few old injuries that won't quit, of course. That's why I drink.
When Aurelia wrote to say she was conducting some kind of investigation, I was shocked.\n\nBut every letter since has shown me a woman changing for the better. I desperately hope she's safe.
Archdruid Michiel has to be in here someplace. We need to find him and make him pay for all the blood he's spilled.\n\nStay vigilant. We'll find rough seas ahead, I'm sure.
All my seasons as a druid, and this is my first visit to Y'ffelon. I just wish it was under better circumstances.
We'll do our best to hold the Ascendant Order's attention while you and Lady Arabelle find another way into the mountain. Look for a cave to the right of the main entrance. I remember that from when Stefan and I visited as initiates many seasons ago.
This business with Julien—I don't want to give him the wrong idea. I need time to think right now. I hope you can understand.
The Orc woman is strong-willed. A challenge, but one that I will conquer nonetheless.\n\nWhat do you think of my menagerie, mortal? Would you like to take your place within?
Do you like the Hall of Judgment? Feel free to look around. \n\nIt has been rebuilt a few times, but this building actually dates back to when the Ra Gada first settled in the Alik'r Desert.
The villagers won't be safe in here for long.\n\nGo help my sister, Helene. She has a way to protect this place.
Now you know how I brought this evil upon Westtry. \n\nToo weak to trust in Stendarr, I gave us all to Molag Bal.
Why are we standing around when Imperial heads remain attached to their necks?
The attacks are faltering. You've driven the Goblins back.
My sons Dedras and Mevis fled south into the sulfur pools during the attack. They're no cowards, but I worry about them.\n\nMaybe one of them knows where their mother and sister went.
Someone will find you at the kinhouse when we're ready to make our move.
Have our town's fortunes improved?
The courtyard is ours. Now all that remains is to cut off the snake's head.
You're alive? You surprise this one. You're stronger than she thought.
I'm so worried. About my husband. About our future.
My brother Skorvild and his warriors gather in a house north of here. I'm sure he'd appreciate any help you could provide.
If the Drublog haven't caught on to our activities yet, they soon will.\n\nThere's a lodge, nearly identical to the one we were imprisoned inside. We could hide there.
I'm so very tired.
Why would you do that? That silk belongs to me!
Look out! Those Houndsmen are everywhere!
Welcome to the fight, my friend. I hope the road from Shor's Stone wasn't a long one.
So what's your answer? Care to prove yourself?
Please take your leave. We've already reached our limit on Khajiiti students.
I'm just glad to be in the field today. I was getting sick of ripping out shalk gizzards for this reagent. \n\nNo, never mind. I loved doing that, too. Almost as much as I enjoy killing people.
The Khajiit are a noble people. To see their jewel in the desert brought low like this … it moves my heart.
We have made excellent progress thus far, but there is still so much to do. Continue your efforts to fill this city and strengthen our army. We shall require every ally we can muster if we are to successfully challenge the Lord of Schemes.
It galls me that the enemy holds the Elder Scroll of Ghartok. We must capture it!
I don't have time for you right now. The Prowler's damaged and unless we get some help, she'll founder at high tide.\n\nYou want to help? Talk to <<1>>.
Malooc take Gudarz and his thugs. I'm about fed up with this place.
He wants you to use that magical toy on the totem that's covered in lightning? Good luck, I guess.
I'm sorry, I can't talk to you right now. I need to get this chamber ready for the trial.
Mannimarco has been watching our every move. We led him right to the amulet!
I'm sorry, I'm retired.
<<1>> is where the Blacksap Rebellion began. With your help, <<1>> will be where it ends.\n\nThe Vinedusk Rangers need you to flush out the Blacksap leaders. Killing them will only fuel the flames of rebellion. They must be brought into custody.
<<1>> doesn't give her recommendation lightly. If she thinks you can assist us, I take her at her word.
Put it in the bowl.
The Blood Matron brought these cultist here for you to prey upon. You need the blood. Drink.
Please refrain from vulgar language nearby. I ask you pre-emptively, as I have no desire to hear coarse words today.
This is the strangest group I've ever hired.
You don't want to go in there, friend. The place is crawling with Riekrs!
Strange times we live in. I always thought Kurog was stronger than the mountains themselves.\n\nMaybe that was the problem.
Please, help me. Pick me! I can heal you as we make our way out of here!
I saw you speak with <<1>>. I know he's upset, but he's wrong about this tomb.\n\nThe remains of <<2>> are inside—not <<3>>.
Rumor has it the guildmaster is grooming you for big things. Soon you won't bother with petty thieving anymore. It's really going to hurt our numbers.
You will recognize the places where the magicka seeps through by the atronachs and spellfiends that are drawn to the power.
I can't decide what's more satisfying—the thought of him making a public apology, or the thought of him curled up in a ball, sneezing his brains out.
Look at the craftsmanship. The attention to detail. Sotha Sil is a true master. Amazing, isn't it? Such intricate work on something so small.\n\nWell, are you ready to go inside?
I don't feel perfectly aligned with sneaking into Lector Naril's private workshop, but we need to determine the truth about the apprentices that entered the Wellspring after Gathal died.
You take the lead. My combat spells are extremely limited. Just stay alert. We don't know what the Aldarch and the Kinlady are doing out here.
I'm already recovering, but I might not be much good in a fight. Clear the bridge and I'll be right behind you.
I'm worried about Iachesis. He's still as weary as the moment when we first entered this damned realm.
Pardon my presumption, but you're the newcomer who saved the Crystal Tower, aren't you?
I overheard what the next arena is, and I don't like it one bit. They're going to have you fight all the champions from the first three arenas. At the same time!\n\nI knew the Blackguards were rotten, but this is just going too far.
How typical! Stibbons got himself into the mud without any help, but now he can't seem to extract himself.\n\nBe a dear and see if you can get him unstuck.
I remember Aneshi. He and his wife were kind to me and they served my parents well.\n\nTell him that Khamira lives and plans to take back our kingdom. He will provide the information we need after that.
Even I, a faithful servant of Azura, can't open a door bearing her likeness. More than a little frustrating, I can tell you.
The Moons sent Zamarak back home for a purpose. This one will make sure Queen Khamira's reign lasts long and proves fruitful.\n\nThis Zamarak swears.
Without you, I would have lost my best friend. Actually, my only friend. Honestly, we don't even get along very well.
Is what Ak'an says true? Do you find common cause with the Breton, Jakarn?\n\nI should warn you—people who travel with Jakarn rarely meet pleasant ends.
This cult recruiter expects you to prove yourself, and that won't be easy in the Black Kiergo. Fighters from all over Tamriel come to test their skills in that arena.\n\nNot that any of them were ever a match for me.
Gods watch over you during these troubled times.
Look at these people. The skin … the eyes. What is Essenia doing to them? To Adusa?\n\nI know these vampires might have misguided loyalties, but no one deserves this. Whatever this is.
The list. On the ledge. Take it. It's important, I swear.\n\nUnless it's time shifted again. I say, keeping anything on your person through these trips is a hassle.
With the knowledge I've gleaned of this curse, I can slow the curse in the afflicted farmers. Go to Kjenstag ruins. Bring any information about Maxten's curse to Morthal. \n\nAnd hurry. I do not wish to see all Morthal turn to bones.
Wonderful! It really is a lovely way to reflect on the year itself and remember those who have passed on. \n\nOften I find that writing the message itself makes me feel at peace, even before sending it on.
Mercenary. You have news?
Let's take the documents we received from Councilors Jirich and Sophus and show them to Councilor Lovidicus. Maybe he can make sense of the Imperial code.\n\nIf not, I know someone I can contact. He's a wonder at these sorts of things.
Looks like your friend the Daedra wants a word with you. You can show her what you found, but don't let her take anything.\n\nHurry, though. I want to get that scroll to my contact in Elden Root before more of those cultists show up.
Honestly, Sister of Pools is really starting to annoy me. At least Deet's got scales again, but I can't take him home like this.\n\nLet's find one more pool and see if that works. If not, well, I can at least tell our egg-mother I tried.
The remaining councilors are safe, but our work's not done yet! We've still got a mystery to solve.
Explore our sanctum if you must, but know that I'll be watching.
This doesn't look good. But we didn't expect this to be easy, did we? I'll stand with you, no matter what happens.
All that and we let Sister Celdina get away. Well, if Lyranth thinks there's some way we can salvage this debacle, I'm all ears. Talk to her and see what she's got in mind.
Search the bathhouse, little mortal, while I do the same.\n\nIn her hurry, Sister Celdina may have left something behind that will shed more light on her plans.
Please be careful with those medallions, dear. It took a great deal of resources to craft them, and we don't have time to make any more.\n\nDeliver one to Arch-Magister Delric and then make haste to the Fighters Guildhall in your capital.
There's got to be more clues about this curse. We just need to find the other captains' logs.
I do believe I could stand here watching Emeric fret about Caska all day.\n\nI told him she's only eaten Bretons once or twice. That I'm aware of.
Honestly, I find this quite invigorating. Taking action against a scoundrel, seeking justice for the spurned!\n\nI rather do wish he hadn't been so dashing.
I hoped to see you again, my friend, but I need to prepare for the Draoife. The elders really must deal with the strife that has come between the circles.
The Firesong leader was hiding in his cabin! We won't get free of this tub as long as he's on his feet. Get over there and clear the enemy decks!
Even though the Firesong surrendered after Archdruid Orlaith's death, it's evident that Lord Bacaro still has the support of some of the circle's more ardent members. Not to mention his own Ascendant knights.\n\nWe need to proceed cautiously, friend.
Damn my clumsiness! If not for the fact that we were delayed by that trap, we could have been here to help you with that creature. Then maybe Lord Bacaro wouldn't have been able to slip away.
The markers should be placed in Y'ffre's Path along the best, er, paths. Oh, you know what I mean!\n\nHmm, maybe you should talk to Sir Aval before you set out. You can find him near the Fighters Guild here in Vastyr.
This is the part of the story I hate the most. When we must inevitably say goodbye. As much as I try to avoid it, I have a terrible habit of growing quite attached to the people I work with. All that said, I will miss you most emphatically, my dear.
I heard about your involvement in ending the Firesong threat and dealing with Archdruid Orlaith. For saving our island and making sure Galphen and the other druids are safe, you have my thanks.
We must move quickly now to save the lake though.\n\nI have enough essences stored away to create the Water Stone, but I lack some crucial elements to complete the ritual.
I fear the time is running short. The poison has nearly consumed the poor little thing.\n\nIf we don't do something now, she will transform at any moment. Have you brought the heartwood?
And now, we must be vigilant against the old master, who knows our secrets and our ways.\n\nIf I see her again, I will gladly fight her to her death, for the honor of Leki's Blade.
Please, hurry! Who can say what <<1>> has gotten his paws on while I've been stuck?
That woman looked at me as if I were an insect. I don't know what I did to make her angry, but I hope I don't run into her again.
That should cause some problems between the Bloodthorn and the Red Rooks. \n\nMaybe we'll get lucky and they'll kill each other off. I wouldn't mind going home to my family and leaving them to fight it out.
Have you found our stones? And the branch?
There will need to be an accounting with this Rhavil.
Thank Stendarr! You're with the guild?
Rala waits for you at the other manor. She'll help you find the crypt.
Have you found anything?
I don't think we can win this battle. What happens if <<1>> kills us all?
Your reputation precedes you. Welcome to Skywatch.
Let's return to the village for the last part of our tour.
I know you can't forgive my clan for what it's done, but they adhere to an ancient promise that will never come to pass.\n\nI could help you, though. No one knows that tower better than I do. But I need to ask for your help in return. It's important.
That was a passable performance. For a mortal.
If you please? I haven't all day to keep this portal open.\n\nWell … I do, really. But I don't want to.
The Drublog refuse to tell me anything. After what happened in Velyn Harbor, I can guess why.\n\nMy sister's safe because of you. Can I count on you here as well?
Hold a moment … you're no cringing diplomat.\n\nI really don't care who you are, as long as you can help defend <<1>>.
Look at that, Lambur! Our half-drowned friend is up and about. We weren't sure you'd make it.
This is the Blessed Crucible, where the fiercest fighters in Tamriel burn, bite, and slash each other for coin.
The crystal … you must destroy it! Quickly, or everyone will die!
Marines do their part. No privateer will accuse us of shirking duty.
I don't think you want to talk to me. I think you want a brew at one of the drinking halls. Move on!
As much as I hate to say it, the wizard knows what he's talking about. Maybe he knows how to stop the Sea Vipers.
So, you're still interested in joining Brackenleaf's Briars?
I'm not going to leave Moira's Hope to those monsters. I promise you, we're going back home. Some day.
Goblins are nasty brutes. You watch yourself on the hunt.
Wyress Asteria let you in? I trust she had good reason. What drove you to seek me in this house of stone?
We'll never find work again.
I'm glad to see you and Aerona were successful. That young woman's got more guts than she knows what to do with, but I can't fault her intentions.
The Serpent and his Scaled Court would destroy Dragonstar … everything. These people mean nothing to him. And if they discover my betrayal, they will dispatch me without hesitation.\n\nBut tell me, have you dealt with the wamasu eggbearer?
I need to go. The ambassador wants me to run to Orsinium and let them know she's on her way.\n\nThey'll negotiate with her or they'll have me to answer to. I owe her that much after all this trouble.
<<1>> and I have argued before, but never like this. He grew up with tales of <<2>>'s grand adventures—I didn't realize how personal this was for him.\n\nBut I'm certain he will come around.
I wonder what they're serving for dinner.
I suppose you're wondering, "Who is this beautiful masked woman and what is she doing sneaking about Kvatch?" The answer is as clear as that cute little nose on your face. I'm here to assassinate someone.\n\nWe have that in common, if I'm not mistaken.
A good showing, slaying the Grand Sermonizer. A pity Cimbar paid for his failure with his life. Keep your blades sharp and your wits sharper, otherwise we may see a similar end to your story.\n\nEven so, I've recorded it all. For posterity, of course.
Friend, have you come across Kelmen in your travels?\n\nThe Thief reported a magical disturbance around Skyreach. Kelmen went to find an old Mages Guild associate he said was working in the area. He has yet to return.
Titus and I shall prepare the ritual. You must light the fires atop the six pedestals. When the fires all burn, we can complete the ritual.
Forgive me, friend. I cannot talk. Too many unfriendly eyes in Sadrith Mora today.
I don't know how we're going to get all this done. I miss the days when I could just request another contingent of slaves.
Kuamta's allowing you to take part in the celebration? Excellent!\n\nIt's essential that you follow her instructions to the letter. Ashlanders are sticklers for the rules, believe me.
Good luck finding everything on my list. \n\nI don't know that we've ever had a fatality at the Jester's Festival, but if you are the first, I'll make sure your name lives on in appropriate ignominy.
Sorry, I should try and finish this while it's still warm …. You think it might taste better cold?
I heard your audition was a success. Of course, I knew my daggers would impress. \n\nNow, you need to mingle with the other potentials and figure out which one is Larydel. No easy task, given this troupe's traditions.
Let me take a closer look. Gin-Rajul, that's my ancestor! And look, it mentions the Ninth Legion by name. This proves they visited this cave.\n\nWe need to keep looking. There must be more clues as to what happened in here.
Zamarak never much cared for necromancers. Dragons? No, this one doesn't like them, either.
I can't believe Khamira revealed herself. This isn't how we talked about that.\n\nShe's right, however. If we run now, we might as well leave our land to Euraxia and the Dragons. Help her show our people that the Dragons aren't invincible, walker.
You have certainly proved yourself worthy of the Mask of Alkosh.\n\nJust do not expect it to ensure all your victories. Its power was only awakened through our connection. With my departure, it shall be but a mask.
I knew Winks could do it! I asked her to find Maezi and she led us right to this spot!
I finally figured it out. Svana's problem. It's you. You're a bad influence.\n\nAll this so-called heroics. It might inspire the princess, but all you really did was kill my fun.
You're not from around here, are you? Pardon my rudeness, but there's been talk of strange travelers in the wilderness. People disappearing from their homes.\n\nYou can never be too careful, especially around outsiders.
Freyleth can tell you more about her plan, if you're really interested.\n\nI hope that you and Adusa decide to help us, but either way, we can't leave until we see this through.
Commander Ortin oversees the Fort Blueblood brigadines. Tell him I sent you and he'll give you his full cooperation.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll recall Ivory Brigade squadrons from the surrounding countryside. The city and this castle will be defended.
I knew I had you pinned right! You're in luck, I already have a kit made up with everything you'll need.\n\nAll you have to do is find the target and set everything up when the time is right. Comedic timing is everything, as I'm sure you know!
We have a task that awaits us within the Sever, yet you linger. Mortal curiosity must be exhausting.
Give him the spring elixir. I am sure it is the right one. I hope it works.
Put the sword on the table. Get this over with.
Who's this? Another valiant defender of Elsweyr? Good, it is strong warriors like ourselves who stem the tide of Dragons that washes over these lands.\n\nBut this one cannot send people to die without proper training.
The herbs in this chamber were preserved for this moment. Gather them, friend of Laurel. We must make the elixir to see why the song drew us here.
Druid Galphen is … interesting. We've exchanged pleasantries in the Vine District, of course, but this is the first time we've really had a chance to spend time together.\n\nI find his insights into our current situation … quite fascinating.
And there she lies, all eight legs pointed at the sky. \n\nSay, you're not bad.
What must we do? \n\nWithout the aid of the guardians, we can't regain control of our Wyrd Tree.
Dame Clarique didn't expect you to go charging in here. She cut me free and told me to follow you. I heard you talking to my father. I hope you're not going to pursue his foolish plan.\n\nIt's too dangerous!
We've been watching and waiting ever since the Seventh Legion took our city. Now's the time to act.\n\nIf you'll forgive my initial rudeness, I need your help.
No time to talk. My sister and I are working here.\n\nWell, unless you're interested in Dwemer ruins. But not too interested. This is our find.
Raynor and I are certain there's something of value down here, but it's locked up tighter than any of the ruins I've ever crawled through.\n\nWe have to find it. Otherwise, this entire trip has been nothing but a big waste of time.
Did you find something?
That's it! The Ritual of Unbinding!\n\nBe careful. The Drublog used it when they attacked us. <<1>> weakened when the shaman read from it.
Without you, the Worm Cult would've succeeded.\n\nYou saved Malabal Tor from the bloody curse of Mauloch. And you saved me when you didn't need to. I will never, never forget your kindness.
Valaste is working the problem out of the Shornhelm Guildhall. See you there, Adept.
This place reeks of corruption. Hallowed, this temple is unclean.
There you are. I was beginning to think you were captured.\n\nWe've a bit of a problem, I'm afraid.
I'm just here as security. You should talk to the great mage, Vanus Galerion.
A guard's life is a thankless one.
They will pay for the innocent lives they have taken!
One of these days, Mannimarco's going to have to fight for himself. I'm really looking forward to that.
Who is Lady <<1>>? Was that truly <<2>>? He seemed rather obsessed with her.\n\nWe must get to the bottom of this.
Wyress Nyronie is brave to undertake such a task.
You've done me a great service in returning me to my vigil.
I was up in that tree for hours! Damned senches. Thank you for the assistance, stranger, I—it's you! \n\nYou helped me before—saved my village. What brings you back? I—never mind. I need your help again. Will you give it?
I prefer to work with maple. It's reliable, plentiful … rarely full of wasps.
I'd love to accompany you, but I have more research to complete. Mzindyne has its own idiosyncrasies and unique features.\n\nGive me enough time and I'm sure to discover something that will benefit us in the long run.
It's a bit much in here. Whoever built this palace was trying too hard.
Don't keep <<1>> waiting.
Follow the river to the right. It flows directly past the entrance to the Sanctum.
You still have your head on your shoulders, so it can't have gone all that poorly. Did you manage to learn anything?
It took considerable effort for the Ritemaster to open this pathway through the Dreaming Cave.\n\nI'll help him along while you and Darien clear the path ahead.
I'm not so sure I feel honored by this current assignment. First, it involves a Dragon. So, death. Next, it involves Selene. So, again, death. Finally? It involves Carindon. So, unrelenting annoyance.\n\nI can't decide which is worst.
Honor and faith, wayfarer.\n\nBlademaster Kasura awaits you at the Vulkhel Guard Manor in the city of Vulkhel Guard. She requests you join her there at once.
I hate being treated like I need protection … but Lyris is right. Fenn and I will just get in the way if a battle breaks out.\n\nClear us a path to the Undergrove. Then we'll catch up with you.
From what Onda said, it sounds like Rasir was closer to a cure than I even thought. \n\nIf he was searching for an ingredient out here, he may have been attacked by one of the afflicted ones. We need to find him.
I'm glad to see you made it out of that place in one piece.\n\nI had to carry Adusa half the way. After everything she's just been through, she needs her rest. And a meal.
There should be one final flame to light deep within the ruin. Perhaps we will find who's been tampering with them there, too.
Look for the smaller void portals. With any luck, we can use these pockets of energy to access the library.\n\nJust don't lose your grip on that shard. And try to avoid the larger breaches. We don't want to get pulled into some nether realm.
The sentry granted you an audience with Ard Caddach? Then go and talk to the man. The sooner he agrees to cooperate with us, the sooner we can deal with the Gray Host.
No sign of my father or uncle. We must keep going deeper.
We should get a move on. The Councilors are safe for the moment, but all this Ambitions nonsense seems a little time sensitive. If it is the Dark Brotherhood, we don't want them getting their hands on Daedric artifacts. \n\nLet's get to Bloodrun Cave.
So this is Nirn? I don't remember ever walking upon this strange world, but the sky … it seems familiar, somehow.\n\nLet's look around and see if the cataclyst and the Bladebearers are here.
I do not trust open portals. Especially those of my enemies. Speak with Lyranth and see how she wants to proceed.
It kind of goes against my nature to tell anyone to hurry up, but Lady Arabelle made it sound like she was anxious to get started. And there's the whole thing about the missing royals and all.\n\nHead over to Mandrake Manor as soon as you can.
They raised their hackles as soon as they spotted Druid Laurel. Got a feeling the Firesong already made an appearance. Maybe you can talk to the wyress? Get her to trust us somehow?
I thought the storm had passed once Sealord Nalos and the Dreadsails were beaten. Seems like Archdruid Orlaith and the Firesong Circle have other ideas, though.
You just entered a war zone and I have absolutely no reason not to cut you down where you stand. We barely survived that surprise attack, and I'm not going to let anyone get the drop on us again.
Well, look who's here! I should've known you'd be making Angof's life miserable. Camlorn wasn't enough for you, eh? \n\nSay, these mists are poisonous. Why aren't you affected?
You! You've endangered us all with your meddling!\n\nWell? What have you got to say for yourself?
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up. If we can't get those portals closed, the first hold of Auridon may fall.
The Prowler, here in <<1>>? They sail with the Gold Fleet!\n\nThey picked a poor time to visit this fair city.
I don't hear the sounds of battle. Are the bandits driven off?
<<1>> really is sweet, you shall see. Tell him Shuzura said "Bright Moons."
We should hurry. From what I understand, the Mane's party has been cut off for several hours. \n\nWe've already got an undead Altmer prince to deal with; we certainly don't need an undead Mane as well!
I fetched my father's instructions and marked on your map where he believes we might find these things.\n\nPlease—he is very weak—we must move quickly. You lead the way and I will follow.
We will win this for my sister, for the shield of Tamrith! For Captain Janeve!\n\nMay the Light shine on us all!
<<1>> can't have been interested in ancient dinner invitations.\n\nNo, there must be more to this. We should find another Welkynd stone and see what we can learn.
Brelor and Nairume delivered Rajhin's Mantle to Elden Root. Now we must recover an Ayleid source of power and a skilled operator.
Those beasts had me up there for hours! Thank you for the assistance, stranger.\n\nListen—can I trouble you for more help? I promise you this forest isn't as tranquil as it appears.
I tried to be polite, but you see how far that got me. Let's meet up at the Valley of Scars. We'll probably need to go with our alternate plan again.
Place the shield on the proper display downstairs. In the meantime, I'll write out a list of the historic relics we're hoping to secure for the museum.\n\nCome back and speak to me after you're finished and I'll give you the list.
Be careful around that hagraven, pal. They're slipperier than greased eels. Uglier too.
Do what you can to get through the camp. If you find a good route through, we'll follow your lead.\n\nOr, clear the way—I'm not picky about what happens to the Iron Wheel.
You should talk to the Archcanon. I think Lord Vivec is running out of time.
Drelyth Hleran of House Redoran, at your service—though I doubt I'll be very useful here. This is Ashlander country, and they've made it clear I'm not welcome.\n\nIt's my fault, really. I made a mess of their customs when I arrived.
I don't see any sign of her here. Did you find anything?
You're a welcome sight, my friend! I could use some help to free these people.
Go ahead. See what Vile's servant wants to tell you before we try to enter the tower.
Josajeh will see reason, I know. She just needs reminders every now and then.
The meeting point is west of the village, beneath a great cypress. We should go quickly. I do not know how long my Naga friend will wait.
Branch and seed. Sap and stone. Root and soul. Dream, in dream, in dream.\n\nI widen my eyes. Do you see? The four of us—tied at the tails. For the sake of mending …! We must see the tree. The tree!
I'll stay here and keep an eye on Many-Whispers while you go and get the key. We wouldn't want him running off before he turns over the charm, now would we?
Welcome! Welcome to Bright-Throat Village. Splay your toes and wallow, friend. All ojels of good will may find rest and respite, here beneath the chimes.
So Bjora was from the Reach this whole time? My best friend, one of these barbarians?\n\nI suppose it shouldn't matter. But, it's still a lot to think about. Let's keep going for now.
Rigurt's beard is going to go gray by the time he's done dealing with these thanes. Can you try talking sense into him? He makes Rigurt's head hurt.
Find Eyfja in Morthal and Hautgerd in Dragon Bridge. Tell them Aerolf sent you. Ask them where they saw the Pale Man and who it stole.\n\nThanks for hearing out an old man. Most just think I've lost my mind. But I know the truth.
Don't let Verandis change the subject. I can't trust any plan the Elf comes up with if he doesn't reveal the whole truth.
We're on the right trail. This wreckage is saturated with lingering sorcery. Whatever this used to be, it held enormous power when it was intact.
Is it just me, or is Lyranth a little more … intense than normal? I mean, she's always scary, but it feels like something's off.\n\nAnyway, I'll meet you at the House of Whims. I can find it, don't worry! How hard can it be?
Ah, my friend. How glad I am to see you again! This island is far more dangerous than I expected. Especially after what just happened.
What do you think? This raft will hold together with two people on it, right? I don't have to go far. Just over to Whalefall.\n\nSorry to sound rushed, but my partner Anton got selected for the game. And I'm pretty sure he won't survive it.
Let's look inside the lodge. That's where the village elders gather. Maybe we'll find out more there.
Heh, it's fun to do things the old-fashioned way. A nice change of pace.
Douse those plants with Y'ffre's rain. Only then will we be able to traverse the room unimpeded.
We cleansed the land around the tree, but this isn't over. Corruption still festers at the Wyrd Tree's heart.
I will join my people soon. Thank you again.
You must not linger here, Moon Hallowed. Now that you know your place in the world, you must go to Fort Grimwatch. You must stand against the darkness with the Lunar Champions.
Oh, don't look so shocked. Haven't you ever seen anyone enjoying a meal before?\n\nDo not give Adusa such a look! We are not all Montclairs, you know.
Dry land, finally. Colder than I expected … very, very cold.\n\nThe manor should be up ahead. Are you ready?
Hilde isn't here. Where could she be? I'm certain this is where she was headed when she left the Sanctuary.\n\nLet's ask around and see if anyone saw her. Hopefully someone can point us in a new direction.
"The battle ends before it begins when you control the field of battle," according to my Odes of War.\n\nThat means it's time to take your place now so that we can perform the divination ritual.
Be quick about your work in there and be wary of traps. Ancestor spirits are not known for their hospitality.
I see them return. You destroyed Etra? Good. Let that victory rattle the roots.\n\nGrave-Singer Ki-At tells me what we seek is not in the grave-stake's symbols, but in the wood itself. I do not know how to read wood, but he says I must.
I tighten my fist. Whiptail takes Famia to the Xul-Thuxis temple. He toys with old magic he does not understand. Tsojei thirsts for his blood, but we cannot let Kassandra escape.\n\nI talk too much. We must continue the hunt.
Euraxia hoped to appease her Dragon allies by assassinating the last Dragonguard of Elsweyr. He died, but at least you acquired the Anequina Dragonhorn and avenged his death.\n\nNow if we only knew what to do with the damn thing!
I didn't gather up any ancient spirits, like you. But, I did make a vital discovery.\n\nIn studying the phylactery you destroyed, I identified three more orbs hidden deep within the temple catacombs. We should make destroying them a priority.
Za'ji can't help but notice that Aeliah's father, the general, has come to the sanctum.\n\nRemember, walker, you never saw Za'ji. Never.
An inscription in a cavern like this could hold great importance. Let's read it before we proceed.
I knew it would come to me. Eventually!\n\nThe ritual, the plaques, the map … it finally makes some sense now.
It took me longer to find my Snow Lily than I expected. Still, it appears you found a vateshran.\n\nTell Lyris what you have learned and see if it matches what she found at Hroldan Ring.
No one in Leyawiin realizes that Undertow Cavern is the final resting place of a great hero.\n\nLet me secure my belongings, and I'll meet you inside. Time to grab the bull by the horns and wade right in. Ha!
That's all the caravanners except Bevene, but there's still one more in need of a rescue here.
The Evergrowth implied that the archdruid is as much a victim as it is. Its darker aspect, the Allwither, somehow broke free and is trying to fully emerge by consuming the grove in corruption. We need to warn the elders. I'll meet you in the village.
We may be too late to save the Eldertide druids here, but we can try to learn what attracted the Dreadsails to this village. Let's look around.
Za'ji has not left Lady Arabelle's side while you were gone. Well, except for when she sent me to warn the alliance leaders. And when Ryvana sent me to fetch you. And when Caska made me go outside because she said my worrying was making her fur itch.
Get to the bow and use the ballista! We don't need another enemy alongside us.
The Ivy Throne. Once the Green blessed this place and those who reigned here. It sleeps, with dreams dark and dim. But it is not dead.\n\nLook around. There is another message for us here.
Great chaos down at the docks, yes? An army of dead rises from the sea and storms the shore ….\n\nCan be very dangerous, or can be a good opportunity? You are interested in opportunity, yes?
Hurry back to Stenwick. I have a bad feeling something's happened.
Excuse me, but I'm very busy.\n\nTalk to my husband, Beron.
We should go to the cave temple of the Nereids.
You drifted off there for a moment. Or maybe I did.\n\nSo what do you need?
The desert has enough trouble in it without anyone to stir things up.
Soldiers turned into bears? People setting themselves on fire? And now a mad mayor, locked in a cathedral!\n\nI know I should be horrified, but it all sounds so exciting.
We are close—so very close to freedom. I have no qualms with leaving now that we are all gathered.\n\nThe Architect waits up ahead. If you can defeat him, we—all of us—will be free to leave.
What else, Assassin? I need to know everything that occurred at the Order's enclave.
Isn't it exciting? We're the first living creatures to set foot down here in more than a hundred years! This will definitely get an entire chapter in my next book!
You look like someone who knows a good business opportunity when you see one. Much profit! Will you hear me out?
Why do you linger, child? Go. Learn.
If M'zum and J'dathal have been robbed, then Mother is likely the next target. And with luck, her cellar will show evidence of the theft.
Huh? Oh. Sorry, pal—still a little woozy. The Dragonfire swept the kidnappers' tracks pretty good. Frustrating.\n\nHow about you? You find anything useful?
You have the oil? Then toss it in the cauldron.\n\nYou don't want to know what else Fenn and the old witch had me drop in that pot.
Let's go. The mound is just past that hill. I need to get a feel for the energy there before I start. I don't want to accidentally turn you into a frog or something. \n\nThat was supposed to be funny.
Even thousands of years later, I smell faint traces of blood, sweat, and fear. A Gray Host survivor definitely hid out here.\n\nLet's have a look around.
I sense … yes, you are the mortal I sent for. And not a moment too soon. Good.\n\nI attempted to get this Mehrunes Dagon cultist to enlighten me. He refused. I may have insisted a bit too vigorously, but it was his own fault.
Did I hear that correctly? Sewers? Do you know what's in sewers? Sewage! It's disgusting!\n\nAll right, all right. Let's just get going before I change my mind.
Madam Whim does nothing unless she believes it benefits her interests. We are much alike in that regard.\n\nWe would be wise to remember that Whim's loyalties are for sale. I will keep an eye on her while you align the rune stones.
I've learned to trust Lady Arabelle's instincts, even if others sometime believe that she overreacts. \n\nAs long as we're waiting, I plan to head inland and talk to a druid I've heard about. Maybe she'll be willing to discuss arcane practices with me.
I'm sorry to follow you both here. I just … wish there was something more I could do.\n\nI'll be ever so grateful if you can get me out of this.
Walk carefully. This place is crawling with those Hadolid creatures. \n\nI won't get in your way once the fighting starts, promise.
So, have you thought it over? The chance to join the Gonfalon chapter of the Roister's Club … well, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nI jest, of course. It is nothing so serious. Still, we would be glad to have you!
Archdruid Michiel, that unrelenting parasite! Good thing we showed up when we did. \n\nGo check on Wyress Tola. After what the Firesong put her through, another druid is probably the last person she wants to see. Dhulef and I will keep watch.
Of all the travesties against nature, this is the most foul. This is the last one, the last spriggan.\n\nThere used to be hundreds in Jackdaw Cove, frolicking about in the grass and the water. They were beautiful.
I thought the gods had abandoned us, but I couldn't have been any more wrong! \n\nAkatosh, forgive my lack of faith!
Once you've roughed up one of their scouts, knock him out with the <<z:1>> I gave you.\n\nWhatever you do, don't kill your target! We can't interrogate the dead. Well, maybe Sabie … uh, Lady Lancarl … could, but I can't. Anyway, the dead smell bad.
Bah! This Thalmor mage will drive Razum-dar mad! Stand here! Hold this! Everything so exact! \n\nThis one prefers more flexibility. He is glad another Eye is here who understands, because we must move quickly here if we are to protect the Dominion.
Ah, here it comes. The big moment. The bang finish. In real life, this is when the Veiled Heritance acquired its newest recruit.\n\nBut in real life, Aranias was alone. In this story, she's not.
Hold on, this will just be a moment.
The challenge before the Pact is to capture the Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma. Help your comrades, warrior!
Adusa has always liked this old castle. It has personality.
I do hope those horrid Goblins didn't mistake my notebook for something edible!
Just throw water on the fire. Please don't make me try to run through it!
I'll meet you at the hideout.
Kor brought Tanek home, injured but alive. He told me you went after the Grand Sermonizer.\n\nTell me, has the deed been done?
Searching for body parts. Gruesome work. The Euraxians are scavengers, five-claw. No, worse than scavengers!
For all his protestations, Svargrim still modeled Solitude after the decadence of the east.\n\nA jarl should live in a longhouse, just as our fathers before us. Still, anyone who can solve our problems can drape their palace in lace for all I care.
If Talfyg here doesn't stop complaining, I'll toss him into one of these graves.\n\nHere I am trying to discover if an ancient vampire threatens all of Tamriel, and I need to rely on this insufferable toad.
Hircine's hind, I appreciate the help, wanderer! I'm in your debt.\n\nAre you in the habit of wandering into dangerous ruins and delivering old storytellers to safety, or was there something you needed of me?
I still have no clue as to how I knew what to do back at Fort Grief. You don't know how disconcerting that is. How … scary.\n\nYou better talk to Lyranth now, my friend.
Please, they won't listen to me. It's true that I used to run with the Red Rooks, but I quit! I hate all the chaos they're causing in Glenumbra. \n\nNow I just want to help save my town, but the guards don't believe me.
You have given away our best defense. Pray there are no further attacks.
No matter their schemes, the chief's other wives didn't deserve their fate.
Have you ever seen a place like this, Hallowed? Even in my dreams, I never imagined it would look like this ….
You are a sight for sore eyes. I need your help.
Sahan seems to been left in a rather awkward position. A bit rude of us to chat while he writhes in pain, don't you think?
Are you ready to hear my proposition now?
I—I just need to focus on my work right now.
Good to see you, friend! Just mind where you step. I'd rather not have to start my search all over again.
My stalker remains focused on me, but I urge you to stay vigilant. Be on your guard and don't trust anyone you meet on the road.\n\nSomeone with the power to hide from Abnur Tharn is not to be trifled with.
Just in time, my friend. When my old companion arrives, I'd prefer to have someone I trust at my side.
Against my better judgment, I think we should follow Za'ji's plan. Besides, it's best if you help secure the boat. We wouldn't want our new friends sailing off without us.
Complete whatever preparations you require. We'll meet you back at the sanctum.
Mother told me this was a bad idea, but did I listen? No. I had to come and see the place my Khajiiti family came from.\n\nAnd could things go any worse? I lost my uncle's goods, the guard he sent with me. I even lost my cat!
Let me know if you find anything. I'm going to keep an eye on Svana. The last thing we need is for something to happen to her as well.
It's hard to imagine, but that abbey was once a thriving bazaar, bustling with commerce and teeming with people. Nothing left but rot and overgrowth—and an abundance of dangerous beasts.\n\nWell, there is one thing that I hope remains from that time.
Master, shouldn't we be seeking Sister Celdina and her Riven Cataclyst? I may spend most of my time in your pack, but I hear every word.\n\nTalk to Lyranth. The clever little Dremora must have a plan. She seems to have hundreds of the things.
I never suspected the Chronicle could fall so completely into despair ….\n\nGwenaelle, my worry grows stronger with every passing second. We have to find her, no matter how far into these tunnels we must travel.
I don't trust anyone in this town. Why won't they tell me exactly what the cure is? Why can't we leave town afterwards?\n\nAnd if they have a remedy, why can't they tell me what's wrong with Draven?
Don't let your eyes deceive you. They trick your senses and tempt your soul.
I hope Kharsthun can get Stibbons back to the Mages Guild without dropping him too many times. I'm not sure what they can do if poor Stibbons gets cracked or even shattered.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for your able assistance!
Ojel. I hiss fire! I nearly caught that lukiul hag, Kassandra, but Blackguards emerged from all sides. Tsojei and I cannot kill these greels fast enough. We will never catch up at this rate!\n\nKaoc!
Take the big adept and go to the Greenleaf Farm. You must convince them to seek the protection of the city walls before the Usurper Queen's forces arrive.\n\nMeanwhile, I have other preparations to check on.
An elderly Alfiq? That's a stroke of good fortune. Few Khajiit speak with more wisdom than an Alfiq Clan Mother.\n\nSpeak with her, but try to be diplomatic. Remember, we're the intruders.
Our hard work has paid off. Finding all the instruments, posting all those flyers.\n\nAll right, I admit it was mostly you. Perhaps the college will make you an honorary bard?
Didn't I send you to Solitude? This place isn't safe!\n\nThe Icereach Coven performed a ritual and summoned one of those harrowstorms. Now Kilkreath Temple is crawling with harrowfiends!
This is where Rada and Lady Belain entered the structure, but I can't find any way to open the doors. I suspect this may be why they needed the keystone.
Remember, get keys off the patrolling vampires or find another way to get inside. Either way, let's get into the archive, find this Nighthollow Testament, and get back to Verandis, all right?\n\nI'll scout around on my own and catch up to you.
This whole situation makes me so angry! I don't want to talk to you anymore, outsider.
Despite appearances, Xynaa is a friend. She took me in and mentored me. Taught me to control my power when I thought it was going to tear me apart. She's the only reason I'm standing here today.\n\nTalk to Xynaa. She'll explain everything.
You saw that ghostly killer flapping their hands about, right? Do you think you can repeat those gestures? I didn't quite follow, but it looked like magic to me.
All right. Get ready. I don't do this very often, so pay attention. You did good, five-claw. I'm proud to have fought by your side and I'm even prouder to call you my friend.\n\nThat's it, enough. If I get any more sentimental, I may start crying.
How did you get here? Wait, don't answer that. Just tell me that you can help.\n\nThere are so few of us left, we could use another able-bodied soldier in our ranks.
Sharp claws.
I've heard of these! Mane Jinninji-ri had them installed almost six hundred years ago during one of the many temple refurbishings. They were thought lost!
These assassins. They thought they were hunting us. Now Adusa turns the tables. Now we hunt them!
Josajeh is one of my greatest pupils, but removing her from this undertaking was essential to its success. I'm sure you understand.
A chance meeting turned fated partnership. Fortuitous for this one, yes?\n\nYou should speak to Ishu first, see if he has any new information for us. His house is just south of the marketplace. Can't miss it.
Were you truly on that island when it rose into the sky? This one wishes he could have been with you.\n\nWell, except for all the cultists. And the Dragons. And the rising into the sky thing.
I'm glad the general has come around. With Imperial soldiers at our side, we might just be able to defeat Laatvulon's forces.
We've seen some amazing things in Blackreach, but this castle … it's beautiful and disturbing at the same time. And it's full of Gray Host warriors, so be careful.\n\nNow take Fenn and see if you can find the ritual site.
Rotate the cubes to match the symbols. Just like you did outside. That should disrupt the ward and open the door ahead.
Another memory. I don't know how many more of these I can take.\n\nJust go on and use the stone. I'm ready.
I never met a building with only a single entrance and exit. Let's look around the courtyard. There's got to be another way to get into the bathhouse.
Not our usual line of work, but I'll tell you this. Helping Lady Arabelle out is never boring.
We sail when you're ready, my friend. I'm proud to fight at your side again.
I overheard. He's sending you back to Tamriel.\n\nMy power is bound within Sheogorath's realm, but I'm at my full power on Nirn. I will be at your side.
I'll stay here and try to keep Kirstaleth calm. I'm shouting, aren't I? I'm sorry!\n\nJust find that flint vine, all right? We'll need quite a bit to reach her.
So you're Famia's caretaker, eh? Don't envy you. She's weak. Here in Murkmire, the weak wind up as wamasu food.\n\nName's Whiptail. Kassandra's bodyguard. Don't need your name. You won't be around long enough. Famia's helpers never are.
It's as I thought. Spirits cling to practically every stone up here. Some more sociable than others. One in particular … it feels welcoming, but old. Wary.\n\nHave a look around. With any luck, at least one of these entities will present itself.
I've never seen anything like this. That fissure …. Did the stonemelt really do all this? Doesn't matter. We have miners to save.\n\nBy my count, three Orcs are still missing—including the foreman, Mugha.
A study, from the looks of it. See if you can find something I can draw a memory from.
Five-claw? Adusa doesn't know what twist of the tail brought you here, but she finds your presence most fortuitous.\n\nI could use an extra set of eyes to watch my back. What say you, my friend? Are your eyes still sharp? Will you aid this one again?
It looks like Ardia will be all right. Hopefully she can make a successful escape this time.
The last ward is inside the cave. I hate caves. They're usually wet and dark and full of creepy crawlies. Eugh.\n\nBut once we restore that ward, my spell will at least be contained within Tor Draioch. Then we can concentrate on fixing it.
Heard all that, eh? Guiffa's a palms-up cardsharp. One of the best Tribute players in town. But, like I always say, if you want to take the measure of a graht, you've got to climb!\n\nThat nose ring gibe was unnecessary, right? I'll get her next time!
With Veshin's key, we can slip into the sea witch lair and grab the relic. Once we contain it, that is.\n\nI should give Umindior another chance. Go back to camp and tell him what we learned. I'll stay behind to make Veshin a little … cozier.
I have an urgent message for you!
You have done it! Open the vault door, Vestige!
I don't believe those doors are going to open themselves.
What a tale you'll have to tell, adventuring with the famous Narsis Dren!
Meet me in Deshaan. The Skald-King's scouts spotted members of the coven near the Shrine to Saint Rilms. We'll start there.\n\nAs for the magic, I'll tell you more about that when we're away from prying eyes.
Hesitating? Well, that's a bit uncharacteristic. Honestly, where's your sense of adventure? Go on. Pull the lever.\n\nI'll be right over here if anything happens, so you have nothing to worry about. I'm behind you, assistant. One-hundred percent!
Count Verandis seems … not his usual self.\n\nBut he wants to talk to you. Please, hear what he has to say.
A forest wraith? I expected to find Firesong druids in here, especially given the size of their invading force. But the wraiths?\n\nThose creatures only appear in the most dire circumstances.
Comrade. A message for you. The guild has need of your unique talents.
The brazier is ready. Valaste prepared it precisely. According to my instructions, of course.
I suspect we must light the braziers in a specific order.\n\nHave you a chance to read the plaques? "First of the Grandmasters, laid to rest." That describes Ghelin-Brol, the Akaviri warrior who helped Reman establish the Dragonguard.
We don't need another complication. Especially when we have no idea when this Dragon will strike.\n\nStill, we can't set sail without a ship. Let's make our way to South Guard Ruins.
Vijari flies with Khenarthi now. He was a good young man. My sister chose well.
That's our target. The ritual site must be somewhere inside that horrid structure. I scouted the area before you arrived. It's full of Gray Host forces.\n\nAnd from what I could tell, Svargrim and Rada al-Saran are both inside.
Hmm. This scholar's research doesn't go back to the First Era, and the other scholars fled? That puts a wrinkle in our plans, all right.\n\nThis Pyre Watch warrior is a promising lead, though. Let's go find her and the other scholars.
This is where the map led us. A lovely and ominous spot for a foreboding Gray Host castle, don't you think?\n\nIf we can't find something about Rada al-Saran and Verandis here, then I'm not sure where else to look.
My friend, the Moon Hallowed. Thank you for all you've done here today. And all you will do.
Yes, yes. Well done, and all that claptrap. Are we done here?
I love Black Marsh. Every step is a dance with death! Every stinking breath may be your last! I ever settle down, it'll be there.
Let's stop by the Lonely Troll before we head to Kasalla's warehouse. If we can find him, this Maugh mentioned in Brondold's journal might know something about Kasalla's operation.
I see Verandis's word is good. He said I could treat with you, and here you are.\n\nThe count tells me that Lady Belain and the Gray Host leader, Rada al-Saran, seek some powerful relic. The Arkthzand Keystone. Is that correct?
We did it! I … I don't believe it! Mannimarco is gone!
Let's be on our way, then. Kasura has agreed to let us borrow her horses.\n\nThe sooner we search these Dragonguard sanctuaries, the sooner we can uncover their secrets.
Now we stand a chance with you here. I saw a drainage grate on the northern wall that we can use to slip into the citadel. We'll meet you inside. From there, we just follow my bear.\n\nKeep your eyes open and weapons ready. It'll be a hornet's nest.
Hello there! I am Rigurt, sometimes called the Brash. And I am large delegate for the Ebonheart Pact Cultural Exchange!\n\nOr I would be. If I had my scepter.
Thank the Green! My friend, it's good to see you out here. Can I beg your assistance?
What brings you back here? The answers lie in that tomb at the center of the Scar. Move swiftly, friend.
I recognize these corridors. The expedition hadn't split up just yet. Everyone aside from Eolaf would have been lead somewhere beyond.\n\nThe exit wasn't far, but it's sure to feel like farther now that the place's crawling with cultists and Daedra.
Remember, rooting out a nest of bandits is a secondary concern today. We just need to find this Grenetta and convince her to give back the Silvelle heirloom ring … one way or another.\n\nThen we'll see what Quistley found.
You're back! Good. You should go talk to the Loremaster—he's expecting you! We can speak after, all right?
Tranquil greetings, my friend. You seem duly prepared for the task ahead. Excellent. Foresight and prudence provide a stronger defense than any shield.\n\nMay the Old Ways guide your path. And again, thank you.
It's good to see you again, Vestige. By the look on your face, I suspect you never expected to encounter your friend Sai Sahan again.
With you and Lyris's help, we've gained the trust of Jarl Reddharn. My father respects the jarl. That will go a long way in convincing the high king to take the coven's threat seriously.\n\nNow we need to do the same thing at Karthald.
You and I working together solves a lot of problems for me. If we find Umindior—great. He can tell us what he knows about the relic. If not, then we've spent that time looking on our own. Efficient.\n\nSo, we should split up!
The Amulet of Kings is in our possession and the traitor Mannimarco has been defeated. But we are not yet finished. The blessings of Akatosh must be restored if Nirn is to remain safe. \n\nBut tonight, we rest.
This is it, Hallowed. We stand on the threshold of our final challenge. The end of the Path.
Don't worry about Jarl Reddharn. I'll make sure he gets to Solitude safely.
So, the information from the former councilors points to an Argonian location. Someplace called the ojel-bak.\n\nVandacia ran off with the documents before we could learn more. Now we need to figure out what it means before his cultists beat us to it!
Hmm? Oh! You can see me! That's a relief. Can you hear me, too?
I heard what Beragon told you. Ojel-bak. I never heard of it either, but my brother sure picked a terrible time to admit that with all his vast knowledge, he doesn't know the word we need the most.\n\nHey, Councilor Lovidicus wants to talk to you.
These outlaws lurking beneath the city … gives me a bad feeling. Let's get in and out as quickly as possible. All right?
Who are you? Another of these useless Leyawiin layabouts? \n\nNo, you're an adventurer, like me. Don't tell me Xigira roped you into this mess too.
I would bet good coin that's our guy, Guruz. Mercenaries have a certain way of standing, even when they're older. You can tell from the way they hold themselves. Go on and speak to him. Ask him about Kestrin's Blades and if he knows about my friends.
Why don't you talk to the knight commander first? See what she wants?
I've always wanted to be a knight. Fighting for justice, righting wrongs. \n\nActing as a shield for those who have none.
It's such a breath of fresh air, being out in the world with you. The Systres are beautiful, but Tamriel is so vast! And wonderous!

The Dragons have returned. Ravaging the land with fire and chaos, these terrible creatures focus their gaze upon the lawless regions of Southern Elsweyr.

The world is dark. My sweet wife is dead.
The tides can still turn to our favor.
Tu'whacca will send his Breath soon.
Tu'whacca has great faith in you.
It claws at me from within. It wants to get out!
It was a trap! They knew we would come.
There's something we need to discuss … privately.
I will see the Withered Hand destroyed.
Someone needs to do something.
Easy, Siphonix, easy.
Soldier, to me!
Why would someone steal from us?
This is a damn disaster!
Shore up the defenses on the path. We can't let those scamps off the mountain.
Take these chains away!
My apprentice thinks he's the arch-mage of a college.
Perhaps that one can help.
My poor, poor village! My heart weeps for Lower Yorgrim.
If only we had a few furs to keep us warm.
Wait! Who's that? Who's over there?
Over here, Champion.
Hurry, champion!
The undead! Y'ffre save us!
Are those Worm Cultists still chasing me?
If I survive this, I swear I'll never drink again!
Yes, yes, in a moment. No, put that back!
Three-times-be-blessed. Over here!
You're no bandit. Not like the others, at least.
There's so many of them.
There is no help here.
A moment of your time, kind walker?
There's one last thing we need you to do.
Hey. Yeah, you. Come here!
Ah, it's about bloody time you showed up!
This one wonders what it tastes like. Does anyone know?
Curse that mammoth! How is something that big so elusive?
Keep calm, just have to keep calm.
Search my packs, you will find nothing! This one is innocent! Tell her <<1>>!
Where are those scouts?
So close to home. So far from help.
We have need of you in <<1>>!
Uela the Hagraven is the true evil here.
I am so not going in there.
Then it's settled. No one goes in or out until the talks have concluded.
You there! Are you the courier from Artisans Craftworks in Mournhold?
The Celestial Mage? In pieces? That's crazy talk.
Pause a moment, champion. I bring word from the great warrior.
I wonder, Assassin … do you have a moment to consider a request?
This place makes me nervous. The sooner we can get out of here, the better.
You there, serpent hunter! May we speak?
Any alchemists looking for some gold?
Damn these shadows …. We have to get to the Cogitum!
Someone! Anyone? We need help here!
You don't look pallid—or dead—enough to be with this lot. I could use your help.
Don't merely be a visitor to Summerset! Help uphold its justice!
A request from the Office of Divine Prosecution! Animal handling desired!
After all that's happened, Summerset remains in danger ….
I was hoping you'd wander by. I could really use your help right about now.
Initiate—a word.
Hey, swamp slug! Over here.
Join me, ojel. I've been waiting.
Watch your step in the Stitches.
Ah, yes, the one who approaches might help us with your artifacts!
Walker! You have a moment to spare, yes?
Over here, walker!
Well, if it isn't her majesty's most sought-after soobor—subor—servant.
Father, how could you?
Quickly! Over here!
If you have any experience with jails, or escapes, I could make use of it!
Another day, another infernal harrowstorm.
Oh, master, where are you?
The Wayward Guardians grow in number. And so does our need to arm them.
Would you care to help a friend receive a blessing?
Oh, hey, one more thing!
You have a moment? Something's come up.
Xi-Tsei. If your path leads to that nest of stone, stranger, I have a request to make of you.
You are requested to appear before the Dread Lady, adventurer.
I must be going insane. A skull? But … it talked. It talked!
House Dufort seeks able marines to drive the Sea Elf menace from our shores!
Hey, over here!

Even by the standards of Malabal Tor, something is not right about the growth of the forest in this vicinity. It doesn't seem unhealthy—on the contrary, it seems vigorous, but in an unwholesome way.
On the border with Morrowind, the Shadowfen region has had more contact with Tamrielic civilization than most of Black Marsh—due primarily to the activities of the Dunmeri slavers who once operated out of the city of Stormhold. Now the Argonians are back in charge.
The Dwarves tapped the heat at the heart of Nirn for many purposes. They used steam to warm their subterranean cities and to motivate their devices. To forge their superb metals, they needed such intense heat that it could only come from molten lava.
When the Tribunal replaced the "Good Daedra" in Morrowind, some rebel Dark Elves who worshiped Boethiah fled south into Black Marsh, where they built the shrine of Tenmorvuk. The Dunmer who built it are gone, but the name lives on as Ten-Maur-Wolk.
Sord Pot-Helm was a prospector who is said to have singlehandedly dug out the cave that bears his name, working until he died at the age of 103, still convinced that just a bit more digging would reveal a fabulous ebony lode.
Now ruined, the subterranean halls of Ondil were built in the early First Era to house Kinlady Fiorallelle's extensive collection of ceramic figurines. It was abandoned before completion when its alignment with the constellation of the Atronach was found to be seven percent off true.
"Throat of Darkness." That's how the scholars at Arcane University translate "Laeloria." The Wood Orcs at Barkbite Stronghold just refer to it as "the Haunted Pit."
Shalidor may not have been the first wizard to call himself Arch-Mage, but history records him as such. When Vanus Galerion founded the Mages Guild, he declared the high guildmaster's title would be Arch-Mage to honor the memory of Shalidor.
In Orsinium they say that these caves are named for their location, "perched high in the frigid peaks." On the one hand, that might have been some kind of wordplay or pun—but on the other hand, Orcs aren't much for wordplay.
The original City of the Orcs was built and razed at least three times before King Kurog decided to rebuild in a new location. At Old Orsinium most of the surface city has been obliterated, but there are still extensive ruins underground.
Orcish punishment can be harsh: their jails aren't known for comfortable cells or gentle treatment of the incarcerated. But even among the Orcs, Fharun Prison has an evil reputation.
An ancient Khajiiti shrine called the "Temple of Seven Riddles" has been overrun by the Khajiit's eternal enemy, the dro-m'Athra. With each passing hour, more Lost Cats pour into Nirn through a gaping rift between worlds. If Tamriel is to be saved, this Maw of Lorkhaj must be closed.
Most citizens of Daggerfall think the Red Rook Bandits are only found menacing travelers on wilderness roads. They'd never think to look for them under the cobblestones of their well-patrolled streets.
How common is worship of the Daedric Princes? Cults come and go, rising in popularity and then being suppressed by the more orthodox citizens. Then the Daedric cultists go underground—quite literally.
What's the safest place for a secret hideout? Inside another secret hideout, of course! Within the Thieves Den the tenets of the Guild are observed by one and all, and no one need fear the intrusion of law enforcement.
Two floors, no waiting, in this handsome walled town house makes for prime real estate in the quaint Rivenspire town of Fell's Run. The local story that the ravens that loiter around the front steps are the revenant spirits of former owners is absurd.
The water swirling through the ancient structure and the darkness of the ruined depths hide a multitude of secrets within this forgotten Nedic temple.
"Egg harvesting must be done with an eye toward balance. Remove too many eggs and you may agitate the workers and the queen. Remove too few and the queen's egg production may fall." —Dorayn Redas, Kwama Mining
"The honorable warriors of the Great House Redoran are the hereditary defenders of Morrowind. To be a noble of House Redoran requires more than being a great warrior, however. One must follow the triune virtues of duty, gravity, and piety." —House Redoran Code
"Among the ancient ancestral spirits who accompanied Saint Veloth and the Chimer into the promised land of Morrowind, the four Daedra Lords, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, became known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles."
Like all the Elven races, the Dunmer devote a great amount of time to the study of genealogy, and information that can reveal ancient ancestral connections remains highly sought after.
"Mephala! In Oblivion you keep your secrets, and the secrets of all those entangled in your webs of subterfuge and semblance. The Spiral Skein is your realm." —The Derisive Necromite
The offshore island of Wasten Coraldale—or Coridale, as the fisher folk call it—contains a wild honeycomb of tunnels and fertile grottoes where sea creatures of all sorts spawn and thrive. It's heavily fished for that reason, despite its many dangers.
The Dreaming Nest is a place that no one may enter unless called there—and no one who is called there ever speaks of it later.
The legendary healing springs of Cicatrice Oasis were famed far and wide all the way back to the days of the Thrassian Plague, when its waters were said to have saved many lives. But the Knahaten Flu cast the same shadow over Cicatrice that it did across all Elsweyr.
This ancient ruin in the icy wastes of the Frozen Coast has long held a reputation for being both cursed and haunted. What truly lies at the heart of Verglas Hollow may never be known, as the unnatural cold makes approaching the place next to impossible.
Tucked away in scenic Hjaalmarch, this rustic gallery contains plenty of space to display all manner of antiquities. A gorgeous waterfall provides water to a private pond, creating a perfect setting for scholarly gatherings.
"Fargrave sits on a planar nexus. What better place to use as a staging ground? From here, the Order of the Waking Flame has access to Nirn, the Deadlands, and any other realm we desire." —Sister Celdina
"Fort Grief? That eye sore? It's been abandoned for decades. Oh, we try to get someone in there to repair it every couple of years or so, but it never takes. It's the disgrace of Niben Bay."—Captain Rian Liore, the Ivory Brigade
Set in an idyllic location between Khajiiti and Imperial lands, this tranquil villa draws upon the Anequina Aqueduct for its dancing fountains and deep cisterns. After relaxing outside, retreat indoors to enjoy healthy nourishment and restful sleep.
"What, the fort? Way I hear it, coin barons could see clear across the island from those parapets. Now all you'll see there is the business end of a Green Serpent's knife."—Prisoner Gagukulg
Castle Navire serves as the seat of power for the ruling house of the Systres Archipelago, House Dufort. Few citadels can boast grander views—or more persistent intrigues.
Once the home of an eccentric merchant-collector, this sumptuous manor possesses a view framed by one of Fargrave's otherworldly skeletons plus offers easy access to all the amenities and exotic goods this city provides.
Surrounded by jagged, shallow reefs and inhabited by fierce predators, this small islet on the far fringes of the Systres Archipelago was practically untouched by man or mer until the Dreadsail's Fleet Queen claimed it as her own.
Early in the First Era, a pious tribe of Nedes followed the Tower's guidance to an undersea anomaly, where they built a submerged sanctuary. Millennia later, the edifice and anomaly remain, providing a secure and wondrous escape from the surface world.

This is a trial that supports 12 players and can be played at normal and veteran difficulties.
When you arrive, pick up the Woe of the Welkynar quest from Olorime. The quest is repeatable so you can experience Cloudrest as often as you like but remember, you can only receive the rewards from this quest once per week.\n\nPlayers can compete for fame and glory on the Trials Leaderboards.
The first time per day you choose to join and complete a random Dungeon, you will get the bonus rewards featured under |cFFFFFFDaily Bonus Rewards|r.\n\nIf you are in a group created by Dungeon Finder and a player leaves, reducing the group to less than 4 players, the group leader can use the Dungeon Finder to find replacements.
|cFFFFFFBlastbones|r| and its morphs. Summoning an exploding skeleton is obviously necromancy.\n\n|cFFFFFFSkeletal Mage|r| and its morphs. The arrival of a skeletal minion always indicates that a necromancer lurks nearby.\n\n|cFFFFFFFrozen Colossus|r| and its morphs. Only a necromancer could conjure up such an undead behemoth.\n\n|cFFFFFFBone Goliath|r| and its morphs. This ability transforms you into a massive skeletal horror—a prime example of advanced necromancy.\n\n|cFFFFFFSpirit Mender|r| and its morphs. Conjuring a wraith, no matter how friendly, clearly qualifies as necromancy.
Maelstrom Outfit Styles\nDuring the Orsinium Celebration, you can earn Outfit Styles of the Maelstrom Weapons! Pages of this Outfit Style will rarely drop upon completing Maelstrom Arena on Normal mode, but they are guaranteed to drop upon completing Maelstrom Arena on Veteran mode.\n\nEvent Tickets\nDuring the Orsinium Celebration, you can earn two Event Tickets every 24 hours per account by completing any Orsinium Daily Quest.

What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
Hurry now...release me!
Hurry now...release me!
Hail.
<Groan>
I need help!
I need help!
I'm still alive...for the moment.
No.
Back again?
Now what?
Can anyone help?
I owe you one.
For Daggerfall!
What do you want?
She's crazier than a cat on skooma.
Now what?
How may I be of assistance?
There's a familiar sight.
There's a familiar sight.
There's a familiar sight!
There's a familiar sight.
You should move on before I lose my patience.
There's a familiar sight.
I hope you can help me...
Yes?
Yes?
I don't know if I can go on.
I don't know if I can go on.
There's a familiar sight!
There's a familiar sight!
You've not forgotten me?
<Nightmare mumble>
Yes?
You have my gratitude.
There's a familiar sight!
How may I be of assistance?
Tell me what you need.
My prices can't be beat!
Aldmeri grandeur!
I tried to read that book. The covers were too far apart.
You again?
You're falling behind!
Over here!
What're we drinking to?
Hello there.
I'm fading...
<Groan>
Wounded...thirsty...
No one knows my pain.
No one knows my pain.
<Snore>
The only fish that go with the river's flow are the dead ones.
Ah, curse it all.
Lend a helping hand?
Too much to do and too little time.
Too much to do and too little time.
You're getting quite a reputation.
You must see that I don't belong here.
<Groan>
Over here...please...
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Come, have a look.
You're going to brave my wrath?
<Groan>
<Groan>
Why must I suffer?
<Snore>

Recite the incantation thrice, then kneel.

I need help!

What can I do for you?
I'm so grateful you've returned.
I owe you one.
Back again?
Yes.
Now what?
Back again?
Ha! That's not a stew pot, it's my laundry!
I'm going to be alright.
You again?
Yes?
There's a familiar sight!
There's a familiar sight!
Help me...I'm desperate.
Help me...I'm desperate.
Yes?
Work builds character, they say.
There's a familiar sight.
I'll have what I'm having.
I'll apologize now...for what happens later.
I'm so tired of answering dumb questions.
You're back! I didn't think I'd make it.
Yes?
I don't know if I can go on.
I don't know if I can go on.

Hello.

Yeah.
You again?
For the Covenant!
Ebonheart honor!
Yes?
What is it?
You again?
I don't have to explain something I never said!
Safe travels.
You won't hurt me, will you?
I wasn't always a beggar.
Listen to me! Hear me out!
You'll listen to me, right?
Will you help me?
Will you help me?
Oh please...help!
Safe travels, I hope!
No one knows my pain.
No one knows my pain.

You must see that I don't belong here.

<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Come, have a look.
What is it?
I've just about had it.
Why must I suffer?

You look eager to learn.
Looking to sell?

Aren't you afraid?
What do you want?
Now what?
Back again?
Back again?
Back again?
Could you...help me out?
I didn't do anything!
Can't you see I'm innocent?
I didn't do anything wrong!
Back again?
<Groan>
I've not seen you before, have I?
I need help!
Back again?
What do you want?
What do you want?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Back again?
Hm?
Back again?
Buying? Selling? I've got what you need!
Now what?
Every man has his price. Mine is ten gold.
What do you want?
What is it?
Yes?
Help me...I'm desperate.
Too much to do and too little time.
There's a familiar sight.
I've done nothing wrong!
Just wait until I am free...
Just wait until I am free...
You're back! Let's drink to it!
<Groan>
Yes?
Xuth, my membranes are arid. I could use a mug of Old Snake Sweat.
I hope you can help me...
I need help!
I feel awful.
What is it?
There's a familiar sight!
I feel awful.
You've not forgotten me?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
How can I meet your needs?
What is it?
I don't have to explain something I never said!
That wasn't so bad.
Safe travels.
Your custom is welcome here!
You bring me business?
I've got a lot to do here.
I've got a lot to do here.
Look who's here!
<Groan>
You there! Please...
Over here!
<Groan>
Wounded...thirsty...
Wounded...need help...
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
What?
You must carry on without me...
Don't cross me.
Well, look at this...
Lend a helping hand?
Too much to do and too little time.
I've had just about enough of this.
You return.
You must see that I don't belong here.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>

Come, have a look.
Sometimes a little lie saves a ton of explanation.
Well, look at this...
I believe I'll have another.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Who's there?
<Snore>
Ready to begin your training?
Looking to sell?
What?
By the powers of darkness, I invoke thee.
You're going to brave my wrath?
You've got some nerve...

Now what?
Ah, you again!
Ah, you again!
Anything you can give...
I suppose I could use another break.
Ah, you again.
Hail and all that!
Hm?
Well?
I hardly remember what hope feels like.
Argh, such agony...
<Snore>
Hm?
May I help you?
Blood for the Pact!
Well?
Well?
Well?
Now what?
Don't let me keep you!
<Scream>
Now here's a likely one.
Progress is slow, but steady.
I'm innocent!
It's good to see you!
I can't promise I'll remember any of this.
Prepare yourself!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Yes?
Help me out here!
Mm mm.
You again?
Does nobody care?
Does nobody care?
If I may be of service?
<Nightmare mumble>
It's good to see you.
Yes?
It's good to see you!

Honor and service!
If I may be of service?
Of course.

He hears voices in his head. Don't worry, they're good people.
What is it?
You again?
Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
Winded already?
Welcome!
I don't need much...
They should really make the mugs bigger.
The room is spinning!
Please, will you help me?
Such pain...
This is going to heal, right?
My grief is without end.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
You have business here?
Quality wares!
What?
What?
What?
I try not to be superstitous. That brings bad luck.
Just a coin...or two.
Just a coin...or two.

This work isn't going to do itself.
You look well.
What am I to do?

The world grows dark...
I've got just what you need.

Now what?
The gods have abandoned me.
Ah, you again!
Argh, such agony...
I'm glad you're back. I grow weak.
Now what?
Ah, you again.
Well?
Now what?

May Z'en's price be yours.
It's good to see you!
Yes?
Help me turn my luck?
Progress is slow, but steady.

My thanks.
Many thanks.
Honor and service!
For the Covenant!
You again?
He hears voices in his head. Don't worry, they're good people.
We've got to keep moving.
What?
Welcome!
Set me free!
Still among the living, I see.
The injustice of it all...
Not a moment too soon!
<Groan>
My wound...it burns!
What?
My grief is without end.
Still among the living, I see!
<Snore>
<Snore>
It's been awhile!
Still among the living, I see!
What?
Did you hear something?
<Scream>
Let's keep it short, shall we?
You're going to bother me *now*?
Just a coin...or two.
I'll be at this again tomorrow.
Why, look who it is.
My end grows near...

Help!
Well?
I am dry with despair.

Hello.
If you're looking for conversation, keep looking.
You didn't forget me!

I have many fine goods!
We don't like trouble here.
What is it?
Yes?
You again?
You again?

That one has voices in his head.
Your gold, or your life's breath.
Things go from bad to worse.
This one can help you, yes?
I don't need much...
I don't need much...
I suppose I could use another break.

Tell me...if the Elves are so clever, why do they not respect the Hist?
Please, will you help me?
This is going to heal, right?
My grief is without end.

Still among the living, I see!

Nice to see you again!
Welcome!

This work isn't going to do itself.
Will no one believe my story?
You're back.
What am I to do?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>

Coins burning a hole in your pouch?
Keep it down. You'll wake the dead!
Must you bother me?

Well?
Ah, it's you!
Spare a copper or two?
Save me from shame with a coin?
My stomach thinks my throat's been cut.
Hm?
I don't seem to be making much progress.
I hope to be done here soon.
Hold steady!
A toast! To...drinking!
Are you following me?
Hm?
Ah, it's you.
<sigh> Again?
<sigh> Again?
What a cruel twist of fate.
I wasn't sure I'd live to see your return.
<Nightmare mumble>
Ah, it's you.
Hm?
How can I help you?
You start trouble, I'll finish it.
Well?
They are traitors to the memory of Aldmeris.
May all your flagons be full.
I fear the worst.
What do you want?
What do you want now?
Yes?
Hello again!

Getting old is no picnic, but the alternative is a lot worse.
Oh! You startled me!

I beg of you...
Quick, help me escape!
Let...me...go!
Let me go!

The biggest liar in Tamriel is 'They Say.'
I've got a problem...
My wound...how it hurts!

May I be of service?
What?
If we do not end this war, it will end us.
<Scream>
Welcome back!
This is taking forever.
This is taking forever.
This isn't right!
Why won't anyone listen to me?
This is all just a big misunderstanding!

Somebody...anybody!

This is just...awful.
You have returned!
Look at the shape I'm in...

I prayed someone would come.
I don't deserve this!

I've lost hope.

Nothing is certain until it happens.
If it's not important, get lost.
For the love of The Three!
Do not waste my time.
It's not that much to ask.

True charity is a rare thing.
You've got the wrong man!
Ah, it's you!
Am I drunk, or is it me?
A toast! To...drinking!
These double shifts are killing me.
Help me...please!

Tell that withered root to watch his back.
Don't fall behind!
I must insist on a charitable contribution.
What do you want now?
Hello again!
Help me get back on my feet?
I don't feel so well...
Step a little closer...

Well?
Have I offended the Three?
Ah, Mauloch. Why me?
Fate mocks me.
A familiar face.
Can I help you?

Well?
Damn you!
Fight well.

I didn't do it, I tell you!
So...I know you, right?

So, you're back!
Oh, pitiful me...
I'm...burning up.
I'm...burning up.
I'm...burning up.
The Thalmor commands!
I can't remember her name. The pretty one.
Not much longer now...
So...cold...
What will become of me?
So...cold...
<Snore>
He should have died when I killed him.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Snore>
I'm a criminal. Criminals don't ask questions.
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
I erect the spine of fear.
Can I help you?
Help an unfortunate soul?
Alms for an unworthy beggar?
A familiar face!
Another dose of the cure!
Come at me!
A familiar face.
A familiar face.
Help me!
Help me!
Well?
I seem to be accursed!
Hope seems a foolish fancy.
<Snore>
<Snore>
Hm?
A familiar face.
Yes.
<sigh> Again?
Well?
Well?
Well?
<sigh> Again?
This one could use a strong drink.
A fragrant bounty! Many thanks.
Damn you!
<Scream>
What do you want?
What do you want now?
Good to see you!
Good to see you!
So much to do.
I've got to get out of here!
I didn't do it, I tell you!
Yes?
Can you help me?
Are you here to help?
Good to see you!
Yes?
Hail.
Hail.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Yes?
Good to see you.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I cannot complain, but that does not seem to stop me.
That was a bit too close.
Help someone in need?
Good to see you again.
Let me out, curse you!
Now who's got a drink for me. You?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
What is it?
I'm at my wit's end.
<Snore>
<Snore>
Well?
What is it?
He goes to the city just for the pickpockets. Says it's the only love he ever gets.
<Scream>
I could just spit!
<Groan>
<Groan>
So, you've returned!
I'm...burning up.
<Nightmare mumble>
Well, look who's back!
I erect the spine of commerce.
Don't be offended. He hates everyone.
I could just spit!
Please, I need to buy food.
And we couldn't...stop...laughing!
<Groan>
<Groan>
So...cold...
Do you see something you like?
Do you see something you like?
What is it?
I invite the forces of darkness to bestow their power upon me!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Of course crime pays. Otherwise there'd be no crime.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
Over here! I need help!
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Snore>
<Groan>
Aren't you afraid?
What do you want?
What can I do for you?
Could you...help me out?
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
I've got a lot to do here.
Back again?
Come! Drink up! Forget your troubles!
Hey! Are you buying?
Had a few while you were gone.
Back again?
<Groan>
Back again?
Help me...please!
I'm still alive...for the moment.
I need help!
Hail.
What do you want?

Can anyone help?

<Nightmare mumble>
Back again?
What can I do for you?
Now what?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Pick up the pace!
<Scream>
What is it?
Yes?
How may I be of assistance?
There's a familiar sight!
Tell me what you need.
Help me...I'm desperate.
Work builds character, they say.
Work builds character, they say.
I'm sure glad to see you.
There's a familiar sight.
I've got mine. Where's yours?
I'll have what I'm having.
Yes?
Hello.
There's a familiar sight.
I hope you can help me...
I hope you can help me...
You're back! I feared I wouldn't last.
Yes?
You again?
I feel awful.
You've not forgotten me?
<Nightmare mumble>

Hello.
There's a familiar sight.
Yes?
There's a familiar sight!
Tell me what you need.
Yeah.
You again?
Yes?
There's a familiar sight.
There's a familiar sight.
I tried to read that book. The covers were too far apart.
I don't have to explain something I never said!
You again?
You again?
What is it?
You're going too slow.
Worthless skeever!
Safe travels.
You won't hurt me, will you?
Ah, curse it all.
Welcome, again!
You need something?
I wasn't always a beggar.
I've got a lot to do here.
There's no proof! None!
<Groan>
<Groan>
You there! Please...
You there! Please...
Oh please...somebody come!
You've come to the right place!
<Groan>
<Snore>
Hello there.
What?
What?
What?
What?
<Scream>
Lend a helping hand?
Lend a helping hand?
Won't anybody help me?
You're getting quite a reputation!
<Snore>
Come, have a look.
Ysmir's beard! What is that terrible smell?
What'll you have?
Won't you take pity on me?
Will this work never end?
<Groan>
Who's there?
Why must I suffer?
Who's there?
<Groan>
What?
I'll keep on killing till the score is paid.
The incense must remain burning at all times.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Your pack getting full?
<Groan>
<Snore>
Aren't you afraid?
Hm?
Back again?
Back again?
What can I do for you?

Help me...please!
I didn't do anything wrong!
Hm?

It wasn't me, I tell you!

I don't know if I can go on.
There's a familiar sight!
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
What is it?
Yes?
You again?
You again?
I've got a lot to do here.
Won't you free me?
Safe travels, I hope.
Listen to me! Hear me out!
There's no proof! None!
What're we drinking to?
<Groan>
Look who's here.
<Snore>
What?
What?
Too much to do and too little time.
You return!
You return.
Will nobody help?
Over here...please...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Come, have a look.
I hope you're not bringing more trouble.
You do *not* want to cross me.
You're going to brave my wrath?
Why must I suffer?
Who's there?
You look ready to learn.
Looking to sell?
What?

Can't you see I'm innocent?
Hm?

Let's go!
Back again?
Now what?

Now what?
What do you want?
Now what?
Now what?
She's crazier than a cat on skooma.
What do you want?
Now what?
I'm well enough to carry on.
What is it?
You again?
Yes?
There's a familiar sight.
Wait for my signal!
There's a familiar sight.
You've not forgotten me?
Yes?
What is it?
You again?
I feel awful.
You arrived in the nick of time.
You arrived in the nick of time.
Yes?
Yeah.
What is it?
You again?
Aldmeri grandeur!
You again?
I wasn't always a beggar.
I've got a lot to do here.
Hello there.
Won't you help me?
No one knows my pain.
Safe travels, I hope!
I'm fading...
<Nightmare mumble>
Your custom is welcome here!
What?
What?
What?
I've just about had it.
You return!
Lend a helping hand?
You've got it all wrong!
You must see that I don't belong here.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
You return!
What hope is there?
Over here...please...
<Snore>
You're getting quite a reputation!
Won't you take pity on me?
Work, work, work.
<Groan>
Why must I suffer?
Why must I suffer?
Who's there?

Recite the incantation thrice, then kneel.
You're going to brave my wrath?

Get me out of here!
Hey! I didn't do it!
Ah, you again.
Ah, you again.
Help!
Argh, such agony...
I'm just as you left me.
Well?
I should drown my troubles in mead.

Ready!
I'm guilty of nothing!
I hope you've got deep, loose pockets!
Yes?
Hello.
It's good to see you.

You didn't forget me!
How...how bad does it look?
Hello.
Does nobody care?

Yes?
I can't feel my legs.

Thanks.
Honor and service!

Wasting time is an important part of life!
I don't need much...
I suppose I could use another break.

It's been awhile!

Oh, this is bad. Bad!
Such pain...
What?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Welcome!
You can't be too careful when you're picking your enemies.
What?
I've had it, I tell you.
You look well!
Oh, no. I dropped it again.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Will no one help me?
What am I to do?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
I've got the experience you need.
I can't remember her name. The pretty one with the beard.
I've had it, I tell you.
You look like you could use a drink.
<Groan>

The gods have abandoned me.
I almost wish I was dead.
Ah, you again!
Argh, such agony...
Argh, such agony...
I'm glad you're back. I grow weak.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Thank you.
Well?
Now what?

I...I'm so afraid...
What is it?
You again?

Honor and service!
If I may be of service?
Help me turn my luck?

I need help!
I'm not the one!
Yes?
It's good to see you!
I hope you've got deep, loose pockets!
This should be fun!
Could you lend a hand?
I've not improved...
What is it?
Does nobody care?
I can't feel my legs.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Hello.
I'm free...and in your debt!
Yes?
Honor and service!
You again?
What is it?

He hears voices in his head. Don't worry, they're good people.
That was...interesting.
Good hunting.
Things go from bad to worse.

Nice to see you again.
If someone would only help...

I try not to be superstitous. That brings bad luck.

You can't be too careful when you're picking your enemies.
You look well!
This work isn't going to do itself.
You look well.

What am I to do?
<Nightmare mumble>
You're back!
Hone your skills.
Do not test me, unclawed fool!
What is her name? The sun-blessed one with small scales.
On top of it all...here *you* are.
Spare any coins?
Filled the whole bucket, he did!
You wouldn't like me when I'm dry.

Hello there.
We should drink to *something*...
It's you. Well, well.

Just tell me I'll pull through.
I've lost hope.
<Groan>
<Snore>
What can I help you with?

If we do not end this war, it will end us.
It's not that much to ask.

This is just...awful.

Well, well.
I could teach you a thing or two.
Might I pour you one of our many fine beverages?
Spare a coin for the needy?

Anything I can do for you?
I prayed someone would come.

Ahh, such pain...

Feel...so faint...
Is that...really you?
Need something?

I seem to be making a lot of enemies lately.
What do you want now?

Scourge take you!
Your gold, or your neck.

Ah, it's you.
Aldmeri Dominion!
<sigh> Again?
Well?
Tell that withered root to watch his back.
You will give Khajiit some moon sugar, yes?
Curse you!
Give me your purse.
Yes?
I prayed someone would come.
There's that face again!
Step a little closer...
Steel yourself!
Hello again.

Help!
Hello again!
Curse my lot.
<Snore>
I'm free, thanks to you!
Customers are always welcome!
Yes?
I always forgive my enemies, but I remember their names.
I'm sorry...I've failed you...
Farewell.
A brief rest, that's all I ask.
One more, and you'll be good-looking!
Hello there.
I'm in trouble here...
I've got a problem...
What?
<Nightmare mumble>
Hey, what's a little extortion among friends?
What?
To what do I owe this 'honor'?
Well, well!
It's not that much to ask.
It's not that much to ask.
It's not that much to ask.

Well, well.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
You have returned.
This one has what you need.
This one wonders if the meat of shaveskins is tasty?
We should throw dice for gold. Interested?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Why carry on?
Listen well, and learn.
In the market for something?
I prefer a life of crime to a life of boredom.

Hurry now...

I'm rather busy right now.
Help!
Hear me out...please!
Yes?
I know you! Sure! You're...um...
Ready yourself!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Are you here to help?
Death would be a relief...
Fate has struck me down.
Hail.
Hail.
What do you want?
What do you want now?
Woe and ruin.
My woes seem infinite.
Good to see you!
I'm...pretty bad off.
<Snore>
<Snore>
I thought I'd never escape.
Yes?
Absolutely.
What do you want?
Nine times out of ten, the cynics are right.
I'm sorry...I can't...
Go on...I'll pull through.
I've never known such fear.
Something I can do for you?
Just hear my side of the story!
Oh! Hi there!
<Groan>
I need some assistance.
I need some assistance.
I'm...badly hurt...
I'm at my wit's end.
I haven't much longer...
<Snore>
What brings you?
Something I can do for you?
I could just spit!
A mug of the local favorite, perhaps?
So, you're back!
<Groan>
Please...somebody...come to my aid!
Oh, pitiful me...
Well, look who's back!
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Please, I need to buy food.
I laughed so hard, all the ale came up!
<Groan>
What will become of me?
<Snore>
<Snore>
Do you see something you like?
The ritual needs fresh blood!
I must warn you, I'm in a foul mood.

Oh, thank you! I've been trying to find my way back to camp for hours now.
Faya says: If you want to see Vandica, just pick up her toy. That's how I always do it!
You're seeing things. You're as jumpy as a child in the dark.
I can still perform my duty.
What happened to Emperor Varen? I thought he was supposed to unify all of Tamriel under his banner. We don't seem that unified to me.
Have you heard? Aldcroft's been flooded with refugees from Camlorn. They say werewolves drove them from their homes.
N'wah! You'll die like the rest!
sputters and comes to life, filling the air with choking red dust.
Anyone can join the Mages Guild. The guild needs more than just spellcasters.
Is that so? Good to know.
We are doomed...
Hey! You there!
No.
Down! Get down here now!
hears strange cries coming from the east.
Then some fool attacked me and got the ring.
That would explain those wolves. Those things give me the shivers! They're just like Faolchu and his army in Camlorn.
Stand your ground!
Stand away, or you'll be sorry.
Confound it!
Oof!
Ow!
Hello.
If I may ask a favor.
A qucik favor?
staggers. The shield around it seems to weaken.
I will destroy you myself!
I will drain you before another Maruhkite falls!
hears something rustling in the bushes at the base of the tree.
So it's true then - we're trapped down here.
rises from the vents.
We have a new challenger!  <<1>> has travelled here to fight for the title of Champion.  Stand and salute those that are about to die!
All Hail <<1>>  the Champion of the Bloodfields!
The Vereansu will prevail! House Dunmer will fall!
begins convulsing as the poison takes effect.
Show yourself! I know you're here!
Zombies are creepy.
What the Dwemer made here, we cannot even imagine. But we found a machine that had this written on it, "The Force of the fire is withstood only by the grip of winter."
What do you think you're doing? That's our food!
You! You will pay for all the mayhem you've caused me. Slay this infidel!
I knew you were stronger than that. Keep your eyes open. There's more to come.
snores.
You think you can stop me from flooding this place! Ha!
moos contentedly.
Team Three has interacted with the big red box. Oh Nooo!
This is Tirinaat's yurt. Do you have permission to enter?
Those are my things! Stop that!
What's going on here? An escape?
Quiet! You'll get us killed!
Those n'wah will do anything for a spot of food. Why shouldn't enjoy watching them do it?
I'd rip your traitorous heart out if I didn't think your blood would poison me.
Friend, have you considered the real value of your soul?
Well fought.
What did you think you could do here?
Enough of this! I will dispose of you myself.
Thank you.
Do not hold the vial too tightly, lest you crush it like an egg.
collapses as the poison takes effect.
Leave me alone! This isn't my fight!
Faithful One, attend the Prophet. Though he is not of the Shadowscales, he will guide you until I have more commands for you.
You'll get no information from me! My sacrifice will ensure it!
The fools seek to despoil Bogmother even as we speak. Her wrath will not be contained!
You hear me boys? This one doesn't leave the camp alive!
Fine, I'll talk! That Khajiit cult in Bloodgutter's been paying us to take people to them. Only been there once, but... they're doing something bad there. Go look yourself! They're just to the east.
You will know it again.
For who can control the urges of blood?"
Thank you. The corruption in my ward is gone … but the other wards … you must find them.
Enough! Enough! Have it your way!
So glad of you to finally arrive. I expect you brought my coin? I... who are you? You're not the Imperials! You'll not leave here alive.
Ha! You cannot think to use the Skull! You know nothing of its power!
There we are. Let's see what they have that I can use...
They're like children playing with their own droppings.
You must be purified!
I'm not stopping here! Those things are too close! I'll meet you at the castle, Phinis!
Ma'jhad is too smart for you! You fell into Ma'jhad's trap, yes you did. Die, fool!
You've done it. I'm … free.
Ahhhhhhhhhh! It buuuurrrrnnns!
Vaermina, drink this blood I now spill!
Help! It burns! Put it out!
Duchess Lakana has the duke twisted 'round her finger.
Defend yourself then!
Face me in the arena!
These mortal trappings mean nothing! There is no hope for any of you!
Bad dreams? Don't talk to me about dreams!
Thugs in the streets! What's Wayrest coming to?
They cannot even begin to comprehend what we've found. To think this power has laid dormant for centuries!
I found a strange vine in my garden the other day.
I heard we haven't had lumber shipments for days.
For the kingdom of Daggerfall!
I will suck your strength from your bones!
Show yourself!
Tiela's prudish ways sickened Casnar. I'm sure of it.
My king ... I await you beyond the veil.
Have you come to meddle, as well? I could always use more corpses!
Keep watch. I won't be long.
That's the signal. Lion Guard, charge!
Thank you, champion.
Many of our noblest warriors will be slain! How can you turn your back to them?
I saw harpies carry someone off to the north!
No, please! I cannot die!
That's right, keep them coming. You can never destroy too many zombies.
Rise, dead of Alik'r. Rise and tear this priestess apart!
I will get <<1>> back to our allies on the other side of the camp, the miners you have freed here.
I'm free. Quickly, my friend. Head to the village!
Imperial raid! You stop the porters. I'll take care of their escorts!
The spirit of Divad raises his blade in salute. Someday, this hero's song will be sung in the Chants of Praise.
Wait a moment, please!
Soon my children. With each essence, we draw closer to the dream.
Rise up! Throw down the Imperials!
That was … a lucky guess ….
Have a taste of lightning!
I've caught you bloody-handed, Argonian!
What? I'll add your skull to that pile, meddler!
I assure you, we're doing everything we can. We're stretched thin as it is, but ….
A dead werewolf brought back to life? Am I really expected to believe that such a thing is possible?
Look, it's the hero who saved King Casimir!
Not here. Just look in the pack.
There is neither death nor destruction if all you choose to see is yourself. Dibella has taught us this lesson.
I mean, more than usual? Almost like sulfur, but fouler. Almost like death.
Maybe the king is feeding us from the Tears of the Dishonored.
I've started seeing more Orcs in our desert as of late.
I'd rather be confused with an Orc than a Breton. You can smell the magic on them.
Haven't you heard? Somebody cleared the Rain Catchers. Our water is clean again.
Because he had someone clear the Rain Catchers silently and without drawing attention to it.
There you are. Good to see you made it.
Are you following me?
He's out. That was fast.
So you're the meddler who undid all of Rhavil's work.
Ha ha ha! Stop! I need more mead.
I feel it! The coral speaks to me.
Enough, I yield. You fight like wamasu!
Who disturbs my rest?
I wish you'd reconsider. The future of House Dres is at stake!
My acolytes won't allow you to curse us with life!
Such power! Were it ever to fall into the Kothringi's hands ….
You say for this next trial I'll need to run? Fine.
Heed my call … Balreth, I summon you!
You're the one the queen spoke of. Divines bless you!
I saw Prince Adrien leading skeletal troops south.
Anything for Evermore!
Are you insane? I'm not going anywhere until they clear those ruins.
Thank the Tribunal I found you!
I told you, Varon. Our champion survives!
Over here! I could use a little help, please!
You've won nothing, dog!
<<1>>! The outsider disputes your challenge.
You won't live to expose me!
I still think this plan is madness.
Oblivion take you! I can't.
The Brother is bound!
Keep your teeth sharp.
He's too powerful. We'll never break him.
Stonefalls will burn.
In response, the morag of Koal Canton released their kwama across the anmor and poured their shein upon the ground.
Your blood will cleanse this holy place!
Supplicant! You are summoned for one final act.
Man, that guy really packs a punch…I mean kick
Destroy the intruder!
You got me!
This one knew it would be so.
Run!
I will not forget you, my friend.
Jofnir visits a remote Dwemer ruin just before his death. No coincidence.
Ah, but before we unleash we must learn to control.
You remembered!\n\nAh, Shalidor. You never write. You never visit.
Boring! Be more imaginative, Shal. Like, "Curse you, Mad God! May you become cheese eternally gnawed by skeevers!"\n\nUnfortunately, I have no more time for constructive criticism. Do stay in touch!
My soul's on fire!
I hear you up there! Get down here and help me!
I grow tired of excuses, Nahrina. When will Tavo return?
I'll show myself out. But I'm not taking that dreadful portal!
Doesn't Arawe look splendid? Always so shiny.
He had treasures! He was child-sized, like an evil baby man.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Look! A puny! Arga gonna eats it!
No fair! You ates the last one!
How many guar does Mother think we can spare?
<Drunken singing>
Ugh, my head is killing me. Didn't think I drank that much
<Davilia coughs.>
The Daggers are murdering us.
Someone help me, please!
Destroy that thing! Hack it apart!
I'm staying. Give me your best dagger.
A new caretaker now carries the relics from the royal tombs. I hope you prove to be better at the job than this despicable Nord.
Few made it back. They were badly burned.
What's your opinion of the Fighters Guild, soldier?
Come to me, my pets.
Why's everyone fighting over Cyrodiil? What's it worth?
Hurry up, Gaston! What in blazes are you doing in there?
Misery and death all around. This pleases me!
You're mistaken. Sheor is a trickster. The Bad Man is specifically associated with crop failure. Appeasing him assures a healthy crop. They couldn't be more different.
That doesn't make sense. If he can be appeased, why do they call him "the Bad Man"?
Mauloch! I give my blood!
The cultists have breached my tomb. There's no time left!
Thanks for the help. See you outside!
I died for this? For Jorunn? I bet he never lifted a sword in his life! But his sister, Nurnhilde. She was a true warrior!
I remember when my sister sat upon her throne. My brother and I would tease her endlessly about being the queen.
You are welcome to join us at our camp if you wish. Whatever you decide, thank you for what you have done.
I can feel the chill touch of Coldharbour draining away. Well done.
Your uncle Fildgor has allied himself with the Stormfist clan and the Orcs, my Prince. We need all the help we can get. You need to apologize to the delegates and get them back to the table before this rift grows any wider.
No! We belong together!
Move or call out and you lose your tongue. Simple, right?
The undead! They march on Fullhelm!
My lord. We're holding the stairs, barely.
You were kicked in the head as a sap egg, weren't you?
Well, isn't that nice? Do you have any sandwiches?
I'm getting out of here!
Look! Over there! Those strange creatures. Is that part of the celebration?
And he adds to his dishonor, bringing these Orc bastards to fight for him. Calls himself Orcthane. Bah!
Did you see that Dark Elf, Naryu? She looks good in that dress! I hope she stops by the inn soon.
Maybe those eggs down there are in better shape. Do me a favor and take care of the undesirables down there. I'll stay here and supervise.
We'll have this place cleaned out in no time.
I doubt I could take you in a fair fight. Luckily, I don't have to.
You cheated, Vurila! Sharp, pointy arrows aren't good enough for Dark Elves! You had to make your arrows explode!
I'll use the sphere to destroy our enemies!
Ambush! Watch yourself.
Traveler, I must speak with you. Meet me at the vault entrance on the ruin's edge.
Let us test your power.
Magic bars the gate!
Everyone! Today we add a new name to the Guardian rolls.
Get over here, you mug! This one's putting up a fight!
It's ready, sir. I put an extra dose in. Here you go.
You're safe.
I'll see you back at camp!
My friend! We have a problem!
I forbid it, young lady! No daughter of mine is going to be courted by a Nord stable boy.
Better to die with a sword in my hand then with claws at my back. Listen, you do what you want to do but I'm staying here.
The picture of true love, those two!
Norion got what he deserved. Time this ritual was ended.
Fire on the deck!
The Hist will abandon us if a Dominion soldier communes with it!
Come closer. But do it slowly.
The testing field to the west provides a safe place to practice your spells.
Stop Thief!
No more delays! Ready the cargo, today. I'm just waiting for the order to go through.
Steel spit. We need to take out their commander, Bernardine. Only way to make sure they don't keep coming after Moroth.
I didn't steal your necklace, my lady! I swear to you. Your son gave it to me. Maurice, please tell her!
Father, no!
And so shall all the Companions' foes fall!
Bernardine is here. I can smell him. Let's do this.
The traitor shows her true colors!
You're safe! Are you hurt?
What in Oblivion is going on?!
Thanks for giving me this chance. I'm going to sneak past the Bloodthorn now. Please don't be alarmed.
You'll pay for that!
I do as the Veiled Queen commands. The only good cat is a skinned cat!
I will not! The Dragon does not flee its lair!
Test Artie SAT 6
Why did you throw her in here? She did nothing wrong!
No, I have come to save you. Listen to me, child.
Your troops grow weak, Thallik. The Worm Cult isn't what it once was. And this mage isn't going to change that.
You two bicker like a couple of married old Nords. You didn't even notice the new arrival.
Leave me alone, sister. I'm busy.
Damn my ancestors. Help! Protect me!
There! The helm! And it's mine. All mine.
I told you, Xohaneel. We will not aid the outsider while our factions continue to argue about the fate of our beloved Hist tree.
This is Line 1 of Conversation 4.
Onward we go!
Hush, Qor. Just rest.
Let me go! It was only a reconnaissance mission!
I've been looking for you.
You've got time to rest and recover. Don't waste it worrying.
After everything our master promised you, you do this to us?
You want to start a riot? Use the ones in the street, first.
I don't answer to you, necromancer. Find her yourself.
I'm not going back with you. That life is over.
And go!
You delay the inevitable.
Halt!
Alanwe, I don't think your husband enjoys my company.
Report, guardsman.
Keep checking. They surprised us once. I don't want it happening again.
Faindor!
Okay. I'll let him know. I say you shortfolk are strange.
There were Worm Cultists? Here?
Come on, the Pact helped us out of a jam. I'm happy to have allies like that.
You're heading to Lost Prospect? Skip it.
The Watch has bigger problems. Like that giant. I'd avoid Lost Prospect, if I was you.
Ha! Thorulf was an odd duck for sure. He'd stare out that window for hours.
The door is there, to the west.
I need to get out of here. Those shamans are looking for some long-dead monster!
They've taken Tovisa and the rest into the mine!
It will be over soon.
Now we'll see what the Mad God has in store. Be brave, adept.
Shalidor! Eyevea is lost … you're obsessed! Can you even hear me?
Goodbye … you stupid old fool.
It works! I knew it would, of course.
Byz go tell chief you want talk.
Ah. Korthor's awake.
The shadows move, adept. Watch yourself!
To arms!
Go on without me. I … uh … have to do something over here.
Come, she waits.
You will die as Sirdor did, and we will drink you, as well.
Now, let's see if I can dislodge this.
Fresh meat for The Crucible, eh?
You're Veiled Heritance, aren't you? I should ask you the same thing.
Once more!
<<1>> insists Velyn Harbor must burn.
Leave me, dog! I've heard enough barking.
Alits? Really? Search around. There should be a door somewhere nearby. I'll keep an eye out.
I've got it!
Cruel? Now that I see you clearly, it's a wonder I'm so lenient. Begone.
You took on Daedra! Are you crazy?
Good job! I knew you could do it. Meet me inside.
The scent of Daedric magic permeates the air. Those who practice forbidden magic shall pay dearly for their crimes!
The crystals hum with power. Go to the center. You should find the key to Prince Maleel's tomb there.
Be at peace, mother.
The archery range is just up this hill.
Champion of the Blessed Crucible, we salute you!
Did I hear that correctly? You passed me off as an Ayleid warlord?
Did you hear that? That sounded like … no, it couldn't be.
Well, I'm done here. Come see me in <<1>>!
Come on, pretty bug … time to give up your innards.
Who are you? Why are you dressed as a brother?
I won't be alone. I can't.
So we're moving camp and more supplies are coming? Sounds like this campaign's going to be longer than we thought.
Yes! Feel that destructive power of fire!
No telling what those Sea Drakes have done to Iriana. And Shamal too.
So, see anything?
Come on <<1>>. Your friend saved my life, but apparently didn't have time to save yours.
Let's get back to work, friend.
A gift?
You're going to use my coin to buy a gown? \n\nWait until you get to Aetherius, <<1>>. You'll have me to deal with again ….
I miss the days when this town was safer.
Gods, you weren't joking? Festius! That's our commander. He and his aides command the assault from inside the ruins! Just stop, please!
Bruno, Bruno! Jacqueline told me that she saw the Duke turn into a werewolf! Isn't that terrifying?
Thanks, stranger. For nothing.
Anytime you're ready.
You're too late! My army feeds!
Over there! It's Mereel!
So I've you to thank for dropping the barriers to the temple sanctum.
Did you hear that?
Your torment is amusing, but I have no time for it.
When his blow strikes, none will be spared! Those who bow to the headman will be cleansed by the pure waters of the sea!
Help me. See if you can rouse that citizen over there. Hurry.
Help me close this portal before more daedra pop out of-
Make sure you don't sleep away another morning, or you'll be short a job!
What were the Dominion trying to do with the Hist?
Did you know there're still people in the old Imperial prison?
They found one alive, did you hear?
Take this token. Pray for Indal. Promise?
Come here, little one ….
Third and last!
Last one. Then we can talk to the skulls.
It is done. Bright moons be praised.
Be ready. This one is counting on you to watch his … er, her back.
Hurry. There's no time to waste!
The forest is haunted!
But what's this? Why, it's King Emeric and his friends from the Daggerfall Covenant! No doubt he's got kind words to share. Take it away, Your Highness!
Let's move! I want that last Stone found and smashed! Or do you lot want to climb another cliff? It's only going to get rainier!
Bright moons guide your actions today, Hallowed.
Thank you for helping me restore my sanity … use this keystone well.
All right, which one of you anchor huggers called me soft? Care to step up and defend that claim?
Come on, Jorunn. We have to keep moving. We're almost there. I can feel it.
Let me explain how things work around here.
I-I would be honored to help however I can.
Why is nothing ever easy?
What a skeever!
I tell you Galdas, that was impressive work. An adept facing Sheogorath himself!
The city's defenders did what they could, but they were no match for Molag Bal's forces. Everyone outside the walls was slaughtered, but the warriors and mages managed to seal the gates to protect those huddled within.
Sithis, exchange my life for the void! Ahhh!
This portal leads to the Hollow City. We shall talk again when we are safely inside its walls.
I think that's the last of them!
If you want to silence me, you'll need power like mine. Daedric magic. What is there to fear?\n\nI was a mere Kinlord. You are a Keeper. Surely you can resist corruption where I fell.
Mind what bumps in the night, now!
Daedric power is not granted cheaply. The Keepers are paying for their new powers with their service. To me.
How easily you slaughter Daedra and Keeper alike. How much more powerful could you be made with my gifts? You are fascinating.
You know I can't … I can't tell you. He holds me bound.
There were no miscalulations, I assure you. Now excuse me, I must wash the smell of cat from my robes.
A hidden passage. Connected to another section of the Imperial Underground, no doubt. We should investigate.
Asteril had a sister? A twin, perhaps? That would explain much. Raz suspects these tunnels will reveal the rest.
Have you heard? The Stormfists have captured Cradlecrush, an old Orc stronghold.
We need to activate the sigil-trees.
You're too late! The Stonefire burns brightly! The Dro-m'Athra are unbound and they shall destroy you!
Our time is now, my children! Swarm forth and reclaim what is ours!
Facing off against the Beast from the East! The Ladykiller! The Heartbreaker! The one, the only …
<<1>>, I command you! By the <<2>>, return to your prison!
Go!
His orders! Had to follow his orders!
I will see my falllen brothers and sister avenged even if it the last thing I ever do.
Are you all right? I was sent by the Mages Guild to help.
An impressive tactic.
The champion is dead! Let's return to the camp where your friend was killed. There's a portal stone there that we can use to reach the council.
Welcome back to Thizzrini Arena for the Final Rounds of the Swordmaster Division Championship!
Give me a moment, Sameer. I must make my offering to Onsi. Come to my tent when you are ready to enter the battle.
My work here is done. I must now attend to my cousin.
Your powers wane, fool. Keep control of this shell! You will need it to destroy the Lunar Champions.
Malarel, why don't you call one of your friends to help you? I'll allow it.
He's one of our own! A summoner, a charmer, a wrangler, and the fiercest of warriors!
The one and only … Einnel!
We have heard enough. Use the portal and return to my daughter's side. You have given us much to discuss, outsider.
Welcome one and all, to the qualifying rounds of the Sorcerer Division Championship!
Here he is, folks … Norirtil the Nefarious!
Who dares disturb my slumber?
Our next challenger is a fearsome opponent from Rawl'kha!
Further down the tunnels, beyond the door. That's where the kwama first broke through.
The Withered Hand sent me here to die. I'm quitting.
Tell the spinner she must do something. It can't spread to the plantation!
She's doing all she can. I'm sure of it.
Get up, scum. This is what you get for brewing skooma.
Approach, newcomer. Converse with me.
What-what have you done to me? You witch!
Now for the rest of them. You lead. I shall strike from the shadows.
Zara, my dear. Allow me to make our friend a little easier to kill!
Raz will meet you back at the Thalmor headquarters. The Trethane must learn of this immediately!
I've got to get out of here. Good luck!
I, Erunor, in accordance with the Oath of Protection, stand ready.
We shall see, Treeminder. We shall see.
As one would expect, we have encountered scattered protests. Nonsense about "protecting the trees."
Captain Ethrel, look at me, we're going to make it through this.
What? What happened? Where is it?
This must be the main "living" quarters. Faenir must be near. At last, my prey is within reach.
By your light this one will lead his people. By your light will this one imbue balance to the Khajiit.
Hello again! Need a way out?
The Hunt … it's turned them. This never would have happened if the Dominion had stayed intact! Damn the eagle banner!
Nonsense, Draval. Think of all the terrifyingly beautiful things we've seen here. I could release an entire codex from today's findings alone.
Watch and learn, my friend. Watch and learn. Let me show you how to close a Daedric portal.
I know—he says I have to spar with <<1>>.
Well, with <<1>> back in charge we're finally getting some respect.
We did it! You were amazing! Now let's get that sigil stone before the Daedra advance.
Your nagging is becoming more annoying than my persistent rash. We finally have a secure base—to go back outside without a plan is even too foolhardy for me.
This is the fourth horse in a month. Wonder why I keep losing them….
Citizens of Arenthia, bright moons hang above us.
We rejoin the March, beneath the Eagle's banner! Aldmeri Dominion!
You will die. You will die and then you will join my army.
Radithax, are you hurt?
Of … of course, my love. Next time we see her, she will know all we plan and we will ask her for her blessing. Aheh. How could she say no?
Quickly. The Wilderking is weak. I must get him to the tower. You should come too.
Quiet. We are being watched.
I have heard that bleak happenings likewise afflict the harbor in Sentinel.
<<1>>! Thank the Hist!
Aelif does not know. Merric, this whole thing is madness. She has us hunting Daedra, and now they come calling on our doorstep ….
I hope you've prepared for undeath.
What were you doing down there? You saw, didn't you?
Stealing rotten tomatoes and other refuse from stablemaster Semiral's midden-heap….
Skordo the Knife, pride of the Fighters Guild, will aid you in your initial assault. Let his strength sweep away your foes and keep you safe.
You! Tharn wants to speak to you! Go to the Davon's Watch Mages Guild! Quick quick!
I cannot follow you into Tu'whacca's Sanctum. My mission leads elsewhere.
Yay! The butterflies! I love to watch them flutter!
I got the barrier down. Molag Grunda has to know we're coming. The Chasm is nearly ours!
Oh look, more gloom and death.
The Valenwood brought him back! It's Y'ffre's will.
Akkhuz-ri … this one should have fought harder. Fought against the darkness. But he was weak.
This one is no longer fit to wear the Mane. That much is clear now. All must be told of his decision.
Yes. I've stolen almost everything we need. One more day and we'll be ready.
I don't care anymore, I can't live like this. I want to go home!
Khali was so angry. We both were. The priests were never very kind to us … but look at you and I today. Khali … I wish you were here.
Back up, lizard. Your breath offends me. And you most certainly did agree to this.
We have an opportunity to replace the battlereeve. Ayrenn's head of military matters could be taken out, easily. And perhaps replaced with one of our own?
All right. Farvad, Talia … you know what to do.
Tu'whacca walks with you, and so will I.
Get out of my way, girl. I have no patience for this!
I am certain that the General has plans for them. With respect, we should wait for his ruling.
There has to be a way to get out of here … wait a moment … something bad is about to happen ….
All right, knock it. Let's just get through the rest of today without losing anyone else.
My son! You took my son!
Yes. The village will be ours, and you shall have your gold.
The diversion I set up is working. Hurry before the Daedra notice and come after us!
Enter the frozen alcove and collect the Flameshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance.
Well done, my friend. Now enter the oubliette and set me free.
I'm so happy you feel the same way!
The Dark Prince will need stronger chains than that to stop me. Come, we have things to discuss.
Fine. If you want the truth, come talk to me.
It was you who rallied this peasant village to contend with me. Fascinating that a mortal could be so troublesome.\n\nI need a replacement for your Erthas. Come. Meet with me, and I will close this Gate, spare your people.
I don't know what to do. I'm so angry at him … and yet … my father is all I have left.
<<1>>! What's happening?
Molag Bal!
I knew we couldn't be that lucky. The Shade has blocked the way.
You're no fun!
We're approaching that vile portal of wrong-doing. I can feel it in my bones. It feels like … evil.
With that portal closed, Molag Bal's reinforcements won't be able to overwhelm us. Now let's get to the Labyrinth.
And here I'd taken to dreaming of a juicy Valenwood steak.
Of course I'm alive. Safe and sound ….
We killed her. How unfortunate.\n\nWe'll search the roads for more.
Ha! Looks like we killed another one.
I'm glad you are all so excited! Please, if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.
By Zeht's tears—what's going on here?
The Redguard's iron will cannot be overcome with standard interrogation techniques. Physical tortures appear to be useless.
What? Why?
<<1>>, what are you saying?
<<1>>, no!
It seemed a fitting choice. It was here that the leaders of the First Era assembled the All Flags Navy to do battle with the Sload.
Do let me know when one happens by, won't you?
We're on our way. Thank you, Captain.
I can't imagine venturing outside the city. There are so many horrible places out there.
<<1>>!
Next, Abnur Tharn, a powerful sorcerer and Grand Chancellor of the Imperial Elder Council.
I'll open a portal to hasten your journey.
Ah, here come some new friends. Let's see if I've still got the touch.
Stay your tongue, Voranil. You insult your lineage by even thinking it. Does the High Kinlord's fate appeal to you so?\n\nWe go with my plan and divide his essence among us. He can't escape his prison if he's not whole.
Of what do you speak, O priest?
That Orc must have made a deal with that Dremora Lord. He betrayed his village, doomed it to reside in Coldharbour! Stupid Orcs and their stupid fights over ugly rock huts. Not that this one has anything against Orcs. Just stupid Orcs.
Damned priests. Treating us like that. Even Shazah couldn't stomach it. But look at us. You and me, today. Shazah … I wish you were here.
So Queen Ayrenn sends her personal champion into the stronghold of her greatest enemy? Either she has a lot of faith in you, or she's trying to get you killed. Hm. I'm intrigued. Come, let us speak.
The hour has arrived, Vestige. The final confrontation with the God of Schemes is at hand. The Five Companions gather at the Harborage. Meet us there.
How dare you intrude within my …. What? It's you!
You warm an old man's heart, my Queen. I remember well those halcyon days.
I'll never get used to this place. Come here, Vestige. I'd like a word before we skip off merrily to our doom.
Thanks barrels! Meet me on the Evermore Docks and I'll have your reward!
I can feel it, Vanus! We can beat this! We can—Darien, behind you!
That was fun, but the main assault needs me now. Don't get yourself killed while I'm gone.
You insufferable mortals! I'll shroud you all in unending dream, make you face your worst nightmares! You'll die clawing your eyes out, I swear it!
What've you done to my husband?
You are not welcome here! We will defend our land!
I love you too, Papa. Rest now. Be at peace.
Oh no!
If you have a moment, I would appreciate a word.
And how exactly did he use you?
I've heard enough! I'll be outside.
Then wear this as leader of our people and rise, Mane of our people.
Rejoice one and all! Long live the Mane!
Draven, wait!
The time has come to demonstrate the true power of my kind. We are not simply monsters who eat children! We are so much more.
Free Will! Get out here, there's someone I want you to meet!
He's doing fine. And when he returns, you all will leave?
We'll stay until Murcien's Hamlet is free, or Sir Etienne and I both fall in the fight.
Sai Sahan! Intruders … cultists … they attacked the abbey. So many of my students have fallen ….
My friend tells me something's stirred up the Wood Orcs again.
Aye, a Dunmer vampire hunter and another hero drove them out and dispelled the evil mist from the moors.
These are frightening times. We must all band together.
I heard that a scout team entered the Daedric portal and found an exact copy of Moonhenge on the other side. They had to destroy it all to close the portal.
There's no sin an Altmer can't erase with a little paperwork, eh?
Clear! Take up positions!
You have bested me and released a thousand times a thousand souls back into the Mundus.
When you're queen, you're welcome to set a finer example, Magus-General.
Sir Cadwell is right, Sai. We will all mourn her, but it was her choice. Her sacrifice to make.
That bastard! Sai died for that Amulet!
Well I ….
Lady <<1>>. You denied my love, and now I deny your journey home. If you beg my forgiveness … convincingly … I'll return the Walking City from where I stole it.
I … I can't ….
Look. You can see it plainly.
Such a lowly mouth can dine anywhere … a trait we both share. What service to our palates should we conjoin in feast!
The guards have keys that open these cages. I beg of you, please help!
You've filled entire graveyards…
You failed me, Sai.
Like you, the real Emeric will be dead. I'll destroy the Covenant, and the people will curse both your names!
Varaine Pellingare will be your opponent! Face me, dog!
Here they come! Don't worry! Crazy Eye has your back!
You could offload the guano to some of the merchants who travel through Wrothgar. It's … Well, it won't go to waste, I'll say that.
You're a pig! I wouldn't have a drink with you if you were the last man alive!
What a wonderful spirit you have! Normally someone like yourself would be beneath me, but today I feel like taking a chance. What do you say?
Very well. Let's go.
Drop the bloodstone into the well. Blood will spout forth, and it'll draw the vampires out of hiding. We'll be waiting to cut them down.
Listen closely. This is the plan.
Someone came through and rousted them out. Returned the artifacts to the Arkay clergy.
Don't eat me! Wait. You're not a spider. I'm saved! Oh thank you!
Calden Malhaven may know a shortcut to the Mews. We were childhood friends, and he knows the city like the back of his hand.
That's the last of them. Good work.
Thank Y'frre, you're not with them!
I hope you are happy. This is a dark day for us all.
Ah yes, now I recall how it was!
Life gets no better than this! No wind, no rain, and plenty of … entertainment.
The world is a cruel place, my assistants. Mages are envied their power, and reviled for using it. We must have a place where we can study in seclusion. A place where all Mages can be safe.
Come here, Adept. I have something for you.
The tunnel is inside the cove beneath the lighthouse. That key will unlock the trapdoor.
Bite your tongue, <<1>>. Your lack of commitment is the reason we're here.
I'm not interested in news. Just tell me you found a way to get us into those tunnels.
Always with the breeches. You lot should get out more. Besides, that's no proper welcome. I propose a toast!
I need to let Verandis know what's going on. In the meantime, talk to Skordo. He knows the city like the back of his hand.
These old eyes see you! Come, come!
Take care, my friend. The spell key is going to become unstable. The effects may be … explosive.
Are you here to help me? Please hurry!
In fact, let's sweeten the deal. You decide she stays, I'll cure her! That's right! Uncle Sheo will make her sane again. Boring old Valaste, whose only friends are books!
Well, as it happens I have one more book here. I'd give it to you in exchange for Valaste. It's called … the Folium Discognitum.
Ayrenn, there's always time to protect you from yourself.
And I'm saying the Dunmer have been enslaving my people for centuries. How does that make me unequipped to understand you?
Hold still just a moment, comrade.
Where is the guard? And what are you doing here?
Enjoy your victory while it lasts. I will return, again and again, until all bow before me.
We … must not falter. Go! Light them!
I hear familiar footfalls. Come closer, Vestige.
See you below.
I can't believe you drug-addled cats were allowed to join the Dominion.
Easy, Nicolene. I'm fine.
And now, I'd like to present the secret history of the Red Pact.
Another thread cut, yet the loom spins on.
Why do they always run?
… in my own two hands! Well, puppet hands count as my hands.
Vile seductress! You have earned your place here!
Come along!
I can't believe this! You're just going to lie down and take a nap …?
Here, again? I mean … yes, mortal?
Emeric … I mean, Your Majesty! Thank the gods!
Grant me Osgrikh and I will grant you his head in your name.
Naemon, now is not the time.
I lost a bunch of coin betting against you!
You've doomed yourself by coming here—you know that, don't you?
Begone, insufferable Worms! I'm working as fast as I can!
I'm shocked your lack of education and repeated blows to the head haven't dulled your wit, Titanborn.
I can, and I shall! Where is the Amulet of Kings?
As the first strum rolled through the blasted town, the God of Schemes stayed his wire-wrapped fist from impaling its last dozen inhabitants.
"O great Eplear," they cried, "how can we thank one who has given us so much?" Eplear thought but a moment. "With a crown," he said.
Farewell. They won't be catching me again. A week down here was very motivating.
Still you fight on? Do you care nothing for your own existence?
<Person applauds.>
<Person yawns.>
What are frost trolls doing in <<1>>? Or soldiers, for that matter? Wait, what about your friend in the Falinesti Faithful?
Why would I want to live with refugees? Especially when the Dominion thinks they may be spies?
Pull it together mutts, we've got a new scamp that's ready to risk life and limb for glory.
Do you really think that death can stop the most powerful necromancer Tamriel has ever known?
Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of beautiful women and an ugly war!
Keep Mannimarco occupied! I'll close the portal!
Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?
What is this? Infant! Do you think your toy can slay a god?
You killed her. You freed us. Haha!
Perhaps it grew tired of wandering and is resting? Or perhaps it has always been thus.
Erm … yes. That about covers it.
I know this can't be easy for you.
Well, if it isn't the king of Fungal Grotto! Tell me, is your head heavier now that you're the king?
I heard you and those mages ran headfirst into something evil in Elden Hollow. Good to see you live to delve again!
People are still talking about that battle on Tempest Island. Did you really kill a hundred Maormer with your bare hands? Alone?
Yes, the Mages Guild neglected to inform us of the particulars of their vault. It seems your goods were temporarily stored … well, somewhere in Oblivion.
We heard sounds of battle! What happened?
I will soon go to <<1>>. <<2>>, I want you to travel ahead with my brother's body. You will make the funeral arrangements.
On your feet. You're coming with me.
Nyronie, no. This person has already offered to help us.
But we need three for the ritual. She can't do it!
The outsider can do it. Only two of us are required for the prayers.
You can never know me, Tharn. In the Book of Circles, Divad wrote that the greatest of warriors suffers his pain in silence, for he knows that an open oven bakes no bread.
Sai, are you well enough to continue?
Another enemy blocks the path ahead. Dispatch it quickly.
That's the stuff!
Never a dull moment with those two. Come. Let's go home.
Oh ….
You're not one for waiting in lines, are you?
Please. I need your assistance.
It's not my fault! Those harpies are crafty! And bloodthirsty!
Fine. Whatever. I mean, I'm sorry, Count Verandis. You know I only want to help.
Thank you. Our business is all word of mouth, so that'll be a huge help. And thank you, friend! We won't forget your support, either.
I shall begin my research at once. Try to determine where Reezal-Jul has gone. In the meantime, you should seek out the High King.
We were so happy at this moment. We were all together, friends and family, enjoying each other's company. For the final time ….
Well, I was going to use those for dinner.
My claws and daggers are ready! This one will fight like a whirlwind of fury!
But … but what will I do? If I can't haul grain, I can't make any coin! My family will starve!
You walked into the wrong farm house, Montclair!
And I wonder, did you forget to brush your hair …?
This door is closer. It could provide a shorter path. Perhaps fewer bloodfiends to contend with.
My daughter loved you, Verandis. She loved you!
We have defeated the Celestial, brave warriors! Akatosh has proven stronger than the pretender god!
Damn it, Darien! Slow down! Wait for me, you long-legged bastard.
You've meddled in my father's business long enough. It looks like I'll have to kill you myself.
What?
I am a weak man. I have no knowledge of combat or the world.
You have bested me and completed the Trial of Fire. Enter Rahni'Za, initiate, and face the remaining trials.
Did that work?
Whatever's going on, even the wildlife is going crazy.
Go where the light leads you, my friend, but I must stay here. I'll await your return.
Puddles, you make me worry so. You can be such a bad guar sometimes.
Thank you for letting me end this my way. Aerona will be fine. Now, let me do this before I turn into a damn monster.
Nilyne, please! You have to help him. Is he going to be all right?
That should slow them down. Quickly, we should get to the Clan Holdfast!
All right, that's it. Visiting time is over. Everyone out and let my patient rest.
Initiate. With this brazier, you have begun the Trial of Fire. With this trial, you will prove that you are worthy to study among the Sword-Disciples.
The last thing I remember before appearing in this time was the sound of a battle horn. Then I heard the voice of the one you call the Celestial Warrior. Tarish-Zi must have heard the same call. It is why we have appeared in this time.
Ah, much better.
The ward is magical in nature. As long as we have the three seals within its vicinity, the door should freely open to us.
I heard you declared my wife a traitor. That you ordered Estre's death. Well? She's gone now, isn't she?
I'll make you pay for taking my daughter's life!
Hah! Did you see that? I thought I was hallucinating the first time. It's like the spirits of this place are trapped in the past.
It is done. Shada has unleashed the curse. \n\nYou must protect this goblet no matter the cost, my dear friend. My time is near, but the Yokudans can no longer win.
Looks like the lovely stone lady here was responsible for all these shambling corpses. An act of desperation to save her city.
Your curses will not work on us, witch! We … willl … break … free!
The books have been gathered and the fires of knowledge shall melt away the barrier.
Be sure to come back, Adept. Eyevea is another home for you, now, as it is for every Mage in Tamriel. Valaste would have wanted it this way.
Arise, Anka-Ra. Defend this temple!
You must defend the crypts at all costs. The Yokudans must not make it through here until the ritual is complete!
None shall get past our creation!
Now, let the waters of this city flow with strength for its people. Let them drink and drive back the Yokudans. \n\nRest well, Zal'ik, and know that today you have saved your people from certain destruction.
Even nature itself has joined with me. Why do you resist? Why not join me? I can give you all the power you would ever need, just as I gave power to the people of this city!
And this is why you should inform this Hara of yours immediately. It is urgent that we speak to her.
As we explained—and with exceptional clarity—we are merely aspects of the one you call the Celestial Mage. Even as we stand here, the Serpent seeks to control us all!
Hara has finally agreed to see us and we will meet with her soon. Do not delay. The enemy grows strong and time is not on our side.
This one does. Her nose is very sensitive, too—and it smells so bad!
I remember hearing when I was young that this was some sort of pirate port. I don't think that's true anymore.
This sword will sing a razor song when it draws across the snake's neck.
Thank you, my friend! See you at the Lass!
The book keeper? What need does a sword have for a book keeper?
The Serpent belongs in the natural order. Would you behead the sun for wronging you?
My armory has a mind of its own.
The Serpent is already defeated. There are none left to threaten you. Now, come. We must restore the natural order of things.
It has been some time.
Defeated. Come, now. We must restore the natural order of things.
The mortals have come far. But only Ansei of First Rank are allowed in this chamber.
You are truly foolish to come farther. This Atronach gives way to no one.
Let's get in the fight.
Open the gate! And let the guar know that fresh meat will be available shortly!
Emissary, a thousand pardons to you. I wished only to show you the best of Abah's Landing, and you have seen but the worst. Let us cut this short, for now.
The Blade will fight you. It is fully empowered, and it wishes to return home.
Take them apart!
What do you seek, little rat? Don't you fear the Serpent's sharp tooth?
Ilthag Ironblood! Last chance! Will you please stop training those nasty trolls?
Gaze upon my most magnificent creation and prove to me the power of your soul. Destroy my Gravelord—if you can.
Please, enjoy my collection. The fallen kings are among my most prized possessions.
The natural order must be restored. Come.
You don't even sound like that bothers you! We have to help them.
No!
I'll try.
You will regret that.
Let's see. We put the totem and the ancient wing bone in the pot. Then we add the potion.
Your hunt-daughter! She told my Kassgra she could marry whoever she wanted, tradition be damned!
So this is where the little alchemist has been hiding.
Excellent! This should allow me to control the Dwarven constructs.
I must go prepare for battle.
The intruders are coming, Lord Warden.
Have you brought me these mortals as gifts, Lyranth? I'm flattered.
We make for the library, and from there, the Elder Scroll!
Hold! The Scroll is here!
Where? There's nothing.
The Elder Scroll!
Go! The time has come! You must face her, before she slays us all!
Waited as long as I could before opening this portal. The Scroll said I'd be skewered if—never mind.
If you're looking for trouble, you've found it.
Well played, friend! Arkay's beard, you're good in a fight!
We made it.
Let the way be opened! Let these wandering souls return home! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!
Quiet, Stibbons! There might still be ogres about! Quickly, Kharsthun. What does it say?
Ah, my sweet Lazdutha! Rigurt has gifts for you, ripe with Orcish affection!
Ambassador Rigurt, this is highly inappropriate! Wait, is that echatere cheese I smell?
Oh, Stibbons, what did you do this time?
That note from Lord Ethian's father. It isn't proof that the captain's done anything to the ambassador, but it doesn't make me feel all warm and happy.
How typical! Now I know why Orsinium put out that call for help.
Keep your eyes open. We're looking for a plant or a root. Something that doesn't appear quite natural.
I know you're in there, Henrisa! Where's my wife?
Free my wife at once, you villain!
I can never tell when you're joking. Fine. What's so important?
These fanatics dare to attack my city? My people? I'll deal with them personally!
Defend the temple!
An outsider carries the flame? Blasphemy!
Did you see that? I saw a flash. I think there's something over there!
Don't worry about me. I've got the stealth thing working perfectly now. Now I just need to find poor Winks.
You again? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you liked me.
Kireth, what did you do that for? You destroyed my sphere!
No!
This is the best Kurog has to send against us? Pitiful!
Your delightful slaughter has impressed The Rat!  Come, come! We have much to speak about!
Help! I'm on top of the tower!
You betrayed King Kurog. I will kill you for that.
Useless fools! Send in the beast!
Those who sided with Bal are traitors. Now they face judgment.
Fear not. Arkay will protect us, so long as we smite his enemies, these foul Daedra.
Now to make a show of helping with the search. Hopefully we'll soon be gone. As should you be!
Forgive me for tracking you. I just … had to know.
Hope you weren't planning to start without me, chief.
We ignite these fires to remember Kurog's true goal—unity for the Orsimer people.
We must look to tomorrow. Outsider, light the second torch. It will burn away the past and guide us to the future.
We cannot be seen as weak and leaderless to the rest of the world. I shall uphold Kurog's dream but I will avoid his ambition. We shall stand together as the new Orsinium!
Some of you question the wisdom of that, but we need to see the Orsimer in a new light. We need to respect and honor each other. That starts today!
What is the meaning of this interruption, wretch? My watch is more important than your inane reports!
Masterpiece? Delivered as promised!
Mess? But … this is an authentic replication of ogre artwork, as requested! The materials came straight from an ogre den!
Ah, you understand!
No! No! Let me go!
I'm going to keep looking for a while. Look for me if you come back.
I want the soldiers from all the clans to circle the fort. Ice-Heart won't escape me this time.
Then maybe this victory will finally convince you and the other chiefs to fully accept my claim to the throne.
Come here! Stand by my side as I address the clan.
You think I'd run from you, Breton dog? I've simply chosen where you die!
Fortune happened, my lovely! And it fell right into my lap! Now come here and do the same and we'll both feel better!
Cursed are Shatul who hoarded the food amidst the siege. Their greed weakened all clans in body and spirit, sealing Orsinium's doom.
Now where did Yannod scurry off to?
Stay safe! Flies and I will meet up with you later.
Any time you want to go out and take care of that, I'll wave to you from the walls.
Awake? Good. It's about time. I would have been disappointed if you died after I dragged you down here.
All right, all right. But if we have to spend another night out in the freezing cold ….
Chiefs have died and all you can think about is a room? Oh, very well.
Lots of activity in the city. Everyone seems pretty excited.
Not so much. I think something happened at the moot.
Gara go yara ar!
I will slay you myself!
I'd be honored, um, King Bazrag, your majesty.
But … but …. I understand.
Wait! Keep low, and keep quiet!
Lieutenant, how has this heretic transgressed against the Dragon God?
My dear sister, I knew you'd find me. Are you here to kill me, too?
You don't seem to mind living here. I thought you hated water.
We live in a cistern.
I am rarely offended. Please, ask.
How can we expect a decent forgery? I can barely read your writing.
I only had one uniform. Go on, recover your boat and meet us by the catacomb exit. Then we can return to the Thieves Guild in Abah's Landing.
What? He seemed the type to talk all day.
A mound of gold is narrowest at the top. Maybe we were foolish to think we'd all stand upon it?
Only one is supposed to be a lie, Quen. I'll bet you've never even seen the queen.
Which means there are less of them around to guard their pay.
Falorah simply must see my new … locket? Where's my locket? Someone stole my locket! Guards! Guards!
Problems already? They should have watered down the drinks.
No, child. I grieve for him every day. He was the only person I ever loved.
<<1>>, take everyone into custody. I want this mess sorted.
No! It's too late for <<1>>. We need to go, now.
He is gone. Moons be praised.  You will keep moving, yes? This one will follow as soon as she can.
She's right you know. Zhaj'hassa was a ruler without peer—lord of a shining kingdom. It was Namiira who gave him this. Name your hearts' desire, warriors, and I will see that you have it!
If we aren't thinking the same thing, neither of us deserves to be in the Thieves Guild. Come on, let's find some food for <<1>>.
You've changed, Anais. Either that, or I've been fooling myself this whole time. Goodbye, my old friend.
A pleasure, <<1>>. I always enjoy dressing you up.
Here you are. Worst of luck to you.
Now we begin our spying? Oh, too loud again, so sorry.
Advice is free. Good advice is worth its weight in … say … your dowry. You'll want to hear what we have to say.
And that saves me the trouble of alerting the castle's defenders.
There's no end to the darkness.
Another missing page from the journal. It shows the secret exit from the treasure vault.
<<1>> couldn't have survived. Could he?
Let me see that.
Did you hear a click? I heard a click! Come on, let's go find the <<1>>.
I know! Isn't it wonderful?
"Exceptional," then. We are in complete agreement.
Wonderful. It's good to know where I stand with …. What's that?
Ah … a sad thing, child. Remember the best times. They are all that matter.
I could hear their screams as I held the switch. I had to do something, I couldn't ….
You mean glue. It sticks to me like glue.
Then we should learn more. We can all can agree on that, yes?
Good. I didn't think you had, I was making sure you had no plans to do so.
In Abah's Landing, it's best to keep your disagreements loud. Helps warn your friends when someone pulls a knife.
I was going to ask <<1>> if she had any spare chalk.
You did bring lockpicks, didn't you?
You will kneel before Zhaj'hassa!
Oh, Tanek! I hate that this happened to you.
Come on! Let's get out of here as well!
I'll take word of your fair offer to my crew—after I observe the initiation, if you're all right with that.
And why should I trust either of them, Quintus? What good is their word when I find the Order at Anvil's walls?
This happened during the Assassin's mission? Did we learn anything or did Mirabelle die in vain?
Pay no attention to them. They are still in shock, I think. I will run ahead to scout out these ruins. I will try to leave a few Xit-Xaht alive so you can share in the glory.
Give it a rest, <<1>>. Whining doesn't suit you.
Is that haj mota-stuffed bread? Oh, how I've longed to taste this delicacy!
Could I bother any of you for a pillow? The ground is very cold. Afraid my rump may fall off.
The challengers stand victorious! Hold on, the Arena Master is signaling for a main event. Now the real contest begins!
Better hope your luck's changed before my next visit.
Yes ma'am!
The Brotherhood is a pox. It deserves to be destroyed.
I'm impressed, Assassin.
So you released the panel. Grabbed your weapon. Rushed out to meet them.
I could have saved them!
I crawled from the tomb. The darkness … you can't imagine the pain ….
I do know you, Annalise. But my orders are clear.
How in Oblivion's bleakness did you get in here? No, don't tell me. I don't really want to know your trade secrets.
Time? Time is my domain, murderer, not yours.
Solace, my Brother.
I … lost? Hmm. I must quit the drink.
Keep your filthy hands off of me! Enough! I surrender!
That thing's awfully large … and it looks kind of dangerous.
If you say so. He still looks angry to me. What are you doing with it, by the way?
I'll see Cimbar and the Dread Father soon … but you need to warn Astara … the Black Dragon is ….

It can't be blasphemy if we don't adhere to that religion, Hilde.
Yarmia never flees at the first sign of trouble. Second, yes, but first? Plus she always comes back. Raz has a bad feeling ….
The Fate-Bearers will deal with the destinies of others. Your charges are safe, for now.
If the killer is dead, everyone benefits. We don't even know if we can trust her!
This winning streak might be over! Give a warm welcome to our hottest champion—Ignaria Denian!
What a feeding frenzy! Look at the blood fly!
I'm sorry, your grace, but these pirates' boots ain't exactly sanitary
Not even remotely.
Mercy only applies to the victors! Fight for your miserable lives!
What bloodshed! Thieves and murderers certainly know how it's done!
If it makes you feel any better, I wouldn't help Hildegard find Kor, either.
You didn't?
Those maggots of Akatosh have displayed Cimbar's body in Kvatch! Astara won't let me do a thing about it.
Why do I even bother?
I'll disinter her and recover it. The damage I do to the corpse will leave its own message.
Mirabelle! Stop teasing Hildegard!
But if you could, wouldn't you want to prevent that from happening again?
If the Black Hand ordered it, I'd slit the throats of everyone here.
I don't know why I bother trying.
The target, by a thumb's width.
Throwing daggers … at targets. With the right twist of the wrist, you can drive them directly into the brain.
<Enraged bellow>
So welcome, Initiate.
Assassin, over here!
His heart shines with the color of night. His song sings with the music of life. His gaze inspires fear and his hands grant the gift of death.
Hail Sithis!
Mmm … new dinner guests. Don't keep me waiting, sweetmeat. I am positively famished!
Won't make any difference.
The ruins of Kardala. Tread carefully. The ancient wards protecting this place may still be active.
Accept them, oh stars.
She helped you, didn't she? I can smell her fear upon you. No matter. I will find her and consume her in time, just as I have her fellow guardians.
Well, I can't give you anything for these.
And what exactly am I supposed to do with a wagon full of goods and no one to buy them, huh?
Hermaeus Mora's shrine waits down below. It seems he has summoned Daedra to protect the shrine since the Celestials appeared. Be careful.
This is such a strange place. You never know what's going to happen next.
No. I will not be defeated. I will devour you!
She does not arouse from her slumber …. What did this one miss?
<Anguished scream.>
Wait, I'll open a portal so you can get out of the city.
Quickly, before more arrive!
These mortals will see to it that your chaos is undone. We will reunite the Guardians, and you will be banished once more!
So much delicious magicka. Sweeter than moon-sugar pastries!
I will not let you do this. I will stop you!
What do you seek, little rat? Don't you fear the Serpent's sharp tooth?
Watch your tone, regent! Your abomination is dead. Will you abandon the Serpent and join me?
A brilliant display of savagery and raw power. You will make an excellent commander for my legions.
Take up my blade, Titus Valerius. You have earned it. Let its might flow through you and remind you who and what you are—a warrior true!
You are my champion, Titus, in whom I am well pleased. Hold tightly to the blade. It will travel with you and serve you well in your own time.
The new arrivals are running away! Is that even allowed?
They've done it! They've dropped the axe on Knight Commander Panthius!
I am fine. Keep going!
Hit me. I want to see what you've got.
Follow me, quietly, away from the gates. We have a judge in common.
These delays are unacceptable. How could you be so clumsy?
You are mistaken. One of my informants saw the Judge prowling the streets just this morning!
No. It can't be. Run! Run now!
I hope that's what Lord Vivec needed. Let's talk outside.
It was rude of me to malign your alchemical practice. I … apologize.
I doubt there's anything related to Saint Veloth in this chamber.
You! How did you—? Bah! I'll finish this myself!
Hmm. Nothing important in there.
I believe I see the treasure vault on the other side of this chamber!
Tiles set in the floor. I've seen this before.
One moment.
I hate what my brother's become.
And look, another passage opens! That will lead to the treasure vault, most assuredly!
My hands are shaking. Stay close, all right?
What … what happened? Come on, let's get out of here!
Always, she is busy and in a hurry.
Flatterer. You can see this view anywhere, now can't you?
Pssst! Come here, walker.
Where to send her first. Hmm.
Neria's only just turned eight! And Mils ….
What can I offer you?
I understand you have some aptitude for magic. You will serve me.
But … my children ….
See what you can find pertaining to Ulran. I've got a dagger and a writ with Councilor Dolvara's name on them.
That's Captain Brivan's seal. I suppose our evil councilor courted favor wherever she could find it.
Looks like you need more skaafin!
Freedom, at last! I don't know how much longer I could have survived ….
When the others are safe, we should seek my Lady's counsel. Hurry back to Pariah Abbey!
Mmm. Don't hold back, lover!
The slaves are revolting! To arms! Cut them down!
Vivec, protect me!
Thank the Three, you're all still alive!
Thank you. Now get to Balmora and stop Veya before she does something she'll regret.
No more rules! No more secrets! House Redoran falls today!
Sounds like the danger is past. Wipe your feet and come inside.
If we don't find anything, maybe we can ask for an invitation to the upcoming council meeting. I'm sure they'd be happy to answer our questions.
Ah, you must be here about those pesky patrol schedules.
This one thinks they like you!
I was speaking to our subjects, not you, you man-sized ham!
Jorunn did not swim to Vulkhel Guard, though he is drenched. This place is too hot for clothing.
Mils, please, if you'd just listen ….
Useless! No one leaves until we clean up this mess!
Worthy … prey ….
Place the essence in the circle here. We're ready to begin the summoning.
Azura, we've dealt with the false Nerevarine, just as you commanded.

Canon Llevule, kneel before me!
Archcanon Tarvus served us well until his death. But when I was most in need of assistance, Canon Llevule rose to the occasion. Now rise once more—as Archcanon Llevule!
Wait until I leave to unlock that thing, all right? I'm not anxious to see what happens when you pull that crystal … prism. Whatever.
Yes, Mother ….
Outlander, quickly, this way!
That they hatched a new queen?
Someone must disrupt the rift, even—even if it means my life.
Is someone there? Please, help me! Down here!
He's a Living God. I'm sure he was just busy. We should have waited longer.
You're talking about that slave revolt?
Yes, yes, most interesting. A miniature version of all of Vvardenfell, shown in great detail.
Come to check up on me, hero?
Go on. I'll get her out of here before the council notices and meet you in Balmora.
This evil has lingered here for a very long time … but have faith that the Old Gods power is far older.
Damn it! Who's doing this? I'll send them straight to Sovngarde!
Egg-sister? What are you doing with that … that shadow tamer?
Wait! I'm with you!
Skeeving fetcher! I'll kill you!
Ah, you've arrived at last. Come forward, we have much to discuss.
Who's …? Are you here to kill me? Too late. Your skeeving chancellor beat you to it.
Factotums harvest the plants and pack them in special containers to keep them fresh before we distribute them to Clockwork City.
Thank you. I'm … unaccustomed to being captured.
You did well. Now return to the Clockwork City and let Daro know what you've learned.
Ugh. Remedial spellcraft is all I can muster, but I will aid you as best I can. Lead on.
Eyes! Sweet, juicy eyes!
Yes, this certainly looks like the galvanic engine. That I'm going to fix now. Right now. Here I go!
<Test>
It's all right. Let it all out.
All right, friends, the guest of honor has arrived! I've cooked up something special for you all. Soon to be favorites, I'm sure!
That doesn't sound very good. What happened in this memory?
You summon me again? I grow tired of this, mortal!
I'm very disappointed, Sherizar. Stop this foolishness and return to me this instant.
New apprentice, step to the nearest speaking tube immediately. We need to talk.
Possibly.
Why, an addition to our party! Forgive my rudeness, apostle. You may call me the Precursor.
Fractured? Discarded? I'm just a tad old is all! I'm sure this is just a mistake.
How did you …? I yield! Just follow me outside, all right? I promise, I will explain everything.
Still, you never tire of it? The smell of oil, or the taste of gruel?
That's true, I suppose. No use crying over spilt milk. Hmm. Milk.
It worked! Prognosticator, tell me what the fates have in store for Kamid of Slag Town.
Perfectly dire, just what I expected. And what about my friend here?
Oh no. Luciana, just let me expla-
I found the lost treasure of the Radius! I made a deal to sell some of the spices and this is the contract. I'm rich!
Everyone in this place is fetching mad!
We call for volunteers. Use their sacrifices while we continue to work on finding a different source of power.
Daedric threat detected.
Stop calling it that. Proctor Saryoni was a troubled man, but I won't have you defaming his name with your heresies.
I'll get the truth out of you, one way or another.
Yes, what better place to study botany than the Wellspring Everwound?
Bolin! Is it you? Speak to me! I need to know it's still you. Please!
You, from my vision, come speak to me!
I'm very disappointed, Sherizar. Chirrhari's plaque of safe passage has been rendered inoperable. Now, return to me immediately.
Hmm. Yes, this is it. Evergloam. Follow me!
Watch your step, Featherless. These stones are near to ruin. Just like everything else here ….
Follow the water, fat-legs! East! East!
You're close now … but not close enough. Now, I will unlock this fool from the Throne and claim what's mine!
Come, nebarra! Let me show you the power bestowed upon me by the Prince of Bargains!
Come, visit, pray to their shrines. I believe earnest faith helps mend their bridges to the divine.
You'll get yours for interfering, mortal.
If the Queen's Eye wants to chase his own tail by following skeever scribblings, fine by me. Anything to keep him out of our business.
Five-claw, good to see you! Raz has a proposal if you have the time.
Who's there? Please, don't hurt me! I mean you no harm.
May the audition begin!
Larydel? But—but how?
Are you sure those creatures can be trusted?
That's what I'm afraid of.
Go inside and we'll discuss this later. And take off that ridiculous hood!
This is a little trick I picked up in Chorrol.
Two lights? There's not supposed to be—all right, whatever.
This is a mistake.
The temple … you must go back ….
That young idiot! We need to get over there!
Sea Sloads! This is worse than the Ritemaster imagined!
Please, leave that aurialis alone! You can't take it!
Good … fight.
Let me accompany you.
What nonsense is this?
This is getting stranger and stranger.
Damn it, they found me again! I'll return when I can—
There's the secret door. Give me a moment to open the seal.
There's a font here.
If you're up for a swim.
I'm taking the Ritemaster back to his study. You need to get out of there!
We should split up. Don't want this little scamp slipping out behind us. I can handle this gap easily. You search the other hall.
You need to go to Valsirenn's study right now. There's a problem.
Beats me. All I know is that we were stuck between a rock and a pitfall.
Raz thinks this is bad.
The energy. Something feels wrong.
Raz will meet our friend in Alinor. You two do what you must.
Another one? You there, come here.
May you suffer in Oblivion for all your wretched deeds. And may I be the last victim you ever claim.
No more sages need die today, Sapiarch. Just give me the diamond keys.
Mephala's damn webbing! It's in all my nooks and crannies! Thanks for helping, though.
That's it? A maybe?
You aren't frozen. You just think you are.
Now go. Beyond the door. You need to see for yourself before I tell you more.
Seems like these cultists have as much of an affinity for the dead Dragon Priest as you do, Jorvuld. They keep invoking her name.
None of them got close enough to give us their little blessing, I can assure you of that.
This way. Follow Raz!

I can't go any farther in this form. If K'Tora notices me, we'll both be lost.
Yes, of course. Dearest, tell me. Our wedding day … weren't we told the moons would be full?
Oh Vanus, I would have thought you less judgmental. It's just a bit of puppetry. Nothing but arcane lift and spirit-handling.
Her last moments were peaceful. I saw to that.
We arrive at the moment of choice. Please, use the Keeper's flame on my remains and set me free.
That's far enough. My Mistress can't be interrupted. Her work is too important!
Then find Ulfnor and Sabina and dispatch them as you did me.
Your Prince? I want no part of Daedra! Help!
But first, let us sit by the sea. I feel like there's much for us to talk about.
Hope they don't put me on ritual duty again. It'll be the death of me.
Nocturnal's been eliminating the sects of the other Princes. Are you surprised she'd turn on her former allies?
That explains the difficulty I've been having.
How could he blame me for this? Is it not enough that I lost my husband? Damn him.

Oriandra, if I die saving the world, know that our brief time together has made me a better man.
Valsirenn! No, damn you!
And when will your ever busy Proxy Queen see us?
I still can't believe I had to find you and drag you back. Was our time together really so terrible?
Well, no. But I was hoping to, ah, conduct some business of a … personal nature with you.
Of all the rotten luck!
Hold there, Arathel! By order of the Divine Prosecution!
All of you, quiet! Have a word with our mutual friend, Talerion … if you want the truth, that is.
This should be all I need. Where did Talomar wander off to?
We're not out of this yet. Let's split up and look for supplies.
Refer to the book and use the rune again when you locate the ancient writing.
By Stendarr ….
I never have, not even for a moment. And I doubt I ever will.
Hmm. I think he resisted the mind trap on his own, but he's still unconscious.
Lotus! She's all right! Thank Jephre! Thank you!
I offer you a place with us. A home, a family. If you promise to serve.
I used the link to anchor part of myself to you.
Definitely a breach here, mate. Say, I was thinking—maybe we should get something for Josajeh to cheer her up! I'm thinking meat of some variety. You meat-brains like meat, right?
My word, the vision showed us the Dawnbreaker! I'm almost positive.
More intruders? Excellent. You'll be nice additions to my soldiers.
Hmm. These ruins are dripping with old intention, mate. Forgotten dreamforms, frothing hour-beasts …. Great place for a blood-ritual. Or a very unsettling birthday party.
Ha! I suppose betrayal runs in the family!
Best find this breach before the tide comes in. Water's full of brain-billies: little spirit-jellies that sting people's memories. Don't believe me? Think of that time you wet your pants. Ha! Hurts, right?
Breach webbed up around here somewhere. Spiders are so adorable. Look at us! We've got eight little spindly arms—isn't that scary? Show me something with eight thousand arms, then maybe I'll get nervous.
The pearl. It's the key to escaping this mind trap.
Well done! Now destroy the pearl and wake up.
Her heart is twisted! She deserves this fate!
You were trying to save her. I know that. It was just … damn it, we need to win this, Val.
You're okay turning a blade on your own? There's no way to avoid it.
Yes, but what happened to the shadow Sapiarchs? They were thick as crows on the lower levels.
Stay… stay back!
No, you mustn't do this!
Too late! The Mistress has already claimed her prize ….
I use this staff to make right what once went wrong!
Nocturnal's realm. We've got to be nearing the top of this damn thing.
I must talk with my sister, but feel free to visit me in the Manor of Masques. I'd love to have a chat, anytime.
Another toast! Raise a glass!
Come and get it.
A closed gate won't save them, Leythen.

Watch out!
I proclaim my gratitude.
Please, you must understand. We only seek the Remnant to — ah, there you are!
Help! I fell into this pit and … oh, Green's mercy! Don't look down. Don't look down.
Zadaza! You avoided the trap?
Some kind of mechanical bridge? Remarkable!
The crystal is near! Come!
Well, that was exciting, right?
Oh, that's hardly fair! Our last expedition was—
Ah, but what about that trip north? That wasn't—
Are you certain you're up to it?
Fair enough. Just take it slow, all right?
Famia's crystal is through the next door. Hop down, yes? This one will follow.
Finally we …. What was that?
Kaoc. Fine! Fall back to the Hist. We fight and die in its shadow. Bare your fangs, root-kin!
Grieve as you will, but do not think to oppose me, old one. That is a battle you cannot win.
Air's a bit thick, isn't it?
What is happening to them, Famia?
I heard a name—Mateem. I … I think our friend is reliving an ancient Argonian's memories!
But where is the Remnant?
Perhaps the Remnant helped them?
Welcome to your new home, my little friends. Now let's listen to how it sounds.
You're not supposed to be in here! You really need to leave!
Another Argonian reliquary. Margus may have enough cylinders to conduct the ritual now.
That's the altar the elders used to prepare the rite of binding. I think I can duplicate the ritual, but I need you to do something first.
Blasphemy! Kill them all!
Up the ladder! Quickly, please.
Wait! Jaxsik!
Kaoc! You go save friend-Famia from that crazy Naga. I will try to keep Jaxsik alive.
We have your conveyors. It only took murdering every Goblin in this place.
And there she goes again.
Is she going to be all right?
No. But it struggles for wakefulness. It gives everything to the Remnant.
I see their approach. You make me wait too long, Xukas.
But … but I was able to perform the Vastei-Sei!
It seems the Dwemer didn't leave the Wrathstone unguarded. Not surprising. I trust you can handle it.
The ancient Argonians certainly liked their stairs. Goodness.
Hold up, I think the rat's onto something.
Oh, please. Let's just get this over with.
Careful, friend-outsider! I'm stretching the rules of the Path by pulling you out of the quicksand.
My friend-outsider will explain. I'm going to take Bhoki home now.
Soriel! Let's get this in the saddle bags. Carefully.
Help! I say help! Stibbons has gotten himself stuck fast!
Iskenaaz, assist our visitor however you can.
Be calm, old Shuvu. No one wants to see that.
Over here, ojel!
Haxara, you have done the unthinkable. Whether you intended to or not, you have harmed our Hist and our tribe. For your crimes, I banish you from our land. Go in peace, but never return.
I'm glad Jee-Lar was finally able to send more supplies. I'll admit, I was starting to get a little worried there.
Well, would you look at that. How kind of this traveler to light our fire!
Blackguards! Is there no depth they are not willing to sink to? One day they will drown!
I'm so close! Can't you see that? You can have your children!
If you hadn't run, you might understand!
Did you not hear? It was Xukas who fought them, alongside Jaxsik-Orrn and a newly arrived traveler.
Seeks! Are you all right?
It is, Famia. And I would be lost without it! Farewell.
Something defiles our stores. It hunts us.
Trap free, for once.
Away with you, cat! It falls upon me to end this accursed war.
These sick-scarred you see—we call them the Stricken. After the Knahaten Flu ravaged their bodies, the people of Elsweyr cast them out.
Jode above, old Aneshi can hardly believe his eyes! Princess Khamira!
Oh, jolly good show! Of course, I planned to deal with the Orc myself, once my reanimation was complete.
For three thousand years I have protected the Wrathstone! I will not fail her now!
Anequina was a Moon-Priest. Could that be the key to using the Dragonhorn?
Glad you could make it. Quickly now, let's head inside.
Necromancers. Only your sister would ally with such abominations.
I have that effect on people—especially my relatives.
Hrrm. What now, mage?
Down?
Too late, old wizard … too late ….
Very good, assassin scum. You and your companion have been most insistent. Come, let us speak.
Dark Moons! They're smuggling spoiled moon-sugar. Very unsafe for anyone to eat.
Ha! Feeling a little jealous? To go so far as to steal your father's pet.
No! Damn you! Let me out of here!
Rakazsa! Rakazsa!
Not so fast, little worm! Let's see how you fare against this nightmare!
Sacred Moons, I don't know what to do with your warning. Why won't you guide me when I need you now, more than ever?
We locked the orbs away, but now our wards grow brittle, and Arum-Khal prepares to emerge once again. Only a warrior of the Hidden Moon can end this—and only with the powers of the Moonlight Blade.
Good! The Moonlight Blade sings the Hidden Moon's song again. Take it to Azurah's Gate. We will speak further there.
Some of these moon tiles are identical. Try different combinations of the mirrored pairs.
Stand in the ritual circle and raise the Moonlight Blade. I will do the rest.
Through faith and loyalty, brother.
This is a nursery rhyme, isn't it? Like the one Vazbi read every night as a kitten. S'rendarr's mercy. Please, hurry, walker!
Oh no! You smashed it! Such pretty colors leaking out.
You think you can keep me from my vengeance? Come, then!
Go. This one will find another way inside.
I'll scout ahead! Tally-ho!
Raz is so pleased to see you and your daughters unharmed. All … three of your daughters.
We will find you. Her reach is boundless!
Burr! Skeevatons are not for eating!

The Shadow Dance Temple ruins? Is that where the Betrayer has gone?
Thank you, stranger. This one will find her way out.
It is all right, Lara-Tan. I believe you.
You did it! Now solve the other side.
At least I tasted life …!
Before he passed, this one learned the truth of the Stricken. Of the role we healers played in their suffering.
Of course! Why else sculpt them on nearly every surface?
Meet Zamarak at the temple and maybe we can disrupt the spell.
You killed Mulaamnir. Good.
There's a dangerous build up of steam! It's going to vent!
You were so young. So young. I'm going to fix this, boy. I'm going to bring you back. I promise.
It cannot end this way, Darloc. Together, we can teach these mortals the meaning of death.
I assure you, Cashia, my wounds are healing quite nicely.
Below … that looks like Prefect Calo. What is he doing here?
Oh, look! More cats! I do adore flaying and then roasting the nasty creatures!
The way out, finally. I can't abide another moment in this stench.
Our neighbors saw nothing, of course. Oh! You've found one of the pieces!
Oh, your eyes shine like glowing mushrooms in Gloomreach! And you're sturdy as a mountain goat's hoofed feet! We should meet to drink mead and eat wolf meat!
I will remind you: Dragons are gods in the flesh.
Another temple relic. Activate it for me, five-claw.
Now, five-claw, we need to reach the temple sanctuary.
Everything … Khunzar-ri, Anequina, Cadwell, Jone and Jode. All of it … into the Dragonhorn.
Well, Raz could stay for one last meal before he departs.
Doesn't Raz always?
You talk to your new god like that? Manners!
Shando … he will not make it.
Get those fires out and ready the ballistae! Move it, soldiers!
Gron Gol Zaam!
The Moon-Priests still guard this sacred place.
Time for reckless audacity and derring-do!
Ah, Orcrest! Kingdom of rogues and thieves. Never did Rajhin feel so welcome within a city's walls. Such a shame that sniveling runt got his claws into it, no?
Bored now. Where is the food?
Here, let me open wide the path to Oblivion!
I should have become a mage. Mages can cast spells to be rid of sand, can't they?
My original question stands. This sand is worse than anything.
Look! There is a door behind these stones. Is this the place we seek?
We must leave before … oh.
Trespassers! We will turn you to slag!
Diiv Mir Tah!
Diiv!
Fus!
Jud!
It seems you are done with our lesson, yes? Very well.
Selene! No! Don't let her kill Carindon! We need them both!
Enough! I relent.
I'll need to draw on more than you to oppose Maarselok. You Bosmer must be my connection to the Green.
He's playing with us!
Unleash me, and he won't be laughing much longer.
Another archive, but no Dragonhorn in sight. Let's look around.
The fragments fit together? What does it say?
Khajiit and their riddles. But when I said Khunzar-ri's name, the aura disappeared. Try the door now.
Take Zar's claw to the Anequina of this age. She can use it to get your kra'jun to Dragonhold.
Unless you can produce it, we'll have to inspect your cargo.
We have an appointment with General Renmus. Here. Our papers.
That's … terrible.
Many take advantage of these hopeless souls. Thieves and cutthroats steal any item of value they still carry. While these refugees languish, the city's underbelly thrives.
SAT Music
We must sneak in, Caska! Sneak! You do remember how to do that, yes?
Nahfahlaar was right. This quarry is teeming with cultists.
A jest? I find it hard to tell through all that facial hair. Now focus. We'll need your fighting skills inside.
Who are these people? And why are they attacking us?
The tremors seem to be intensifying. What's happening?
You have both ventured far and come so close, but only one may claim the Mask of Alkosh.
Here we are! Khenarthi's Breath Temple, home to sweet winds and pleasant chimes.
Have no fear, Za'ji the Dragonslayer has arrived!
You … you are the Khunzar-ri!
This is the spot. Where the liminal of here touches the liminal of there.
I don't see Nartise. Let's move on.
I must aid the wizard or the explosion will destroy everything.
I think we really hurt him! This crazy plan might actually work!
If Tharn still lives, he could have taken refuge inside.
Moons help him, but I suspect Tharn has more to worry about than the floating island.
The focal point should be just up ahead.
Ranza! You followed that black robed ziss to a house, didn't you?
Not so loud, Caska! What if the recruiter is still here?
I told you the captain would get the Pounce back!
Save it for the Dragon! Keep moving.
I've had enough of you insects. For now.
Apologies never did suit you, Nahfahlaar. You are here now. That is all that matters.
Books? Daini doubts Turo even knows how to read. Hmm. No rare titles. Leave them.
Strike that bell and you kill all Dak'radhi has left!
Your blood will be in the next batch!
The bear-woman! She's here! She's—
Hmm. You found an altar? Maybe the witches left some reagents, or scrolls, or something.
Stay down, witch-scum! Come on, we're getting close to the ritual, I know it.
Just as Queen Khamira said. A door hidden behind a waterfall!
Just trust us, father. I swear, we won't let you down.
Into the bay? Really? I think the ghost cat did that on purpose!
A single hoarvor? Honestly? This is an exclusive gathering for Senchal's elite, not a Goblin petting zoo.
That's the Wall?
Come with me, Jano. Let me show you before we fade away.
Bow lost, boots ruined! Lady G shall hear of this! I demand redress!
You here about the New Moon business? Shirnama's in the attic.
I will? I mean, of course I will!
Aw, again with the vomit?
Impressive! But let us see how you fare against the vicious Iron Orcs!
We're not done yet! Next up is some local favorites, the Ruddy Fangs of Elsweyr!
Nephew! This one came as soon as he got the message from Maezi.
Horse Neigh SFX, no VO
What are we going to do now?
I was to be … the New Moon's Mane ….
The way this one hears it, they took down an entire fortress together. And killed a Dragon to boot!
You missed it, my friend! Caska the Unconquered made her return to the Black Kiergo.
Tuhada!
Or your wretched son.
We fought hard for this victory, Dragonguard. To save the people of Elsweyr, of all Tamriel, from Laatvulon's tyranny.
Goodnight, father.
Goodnight, son.
That woman, Khamira. Turns out she's the blooming queen of Rimmen!
Come, my lost cat. Paint your mark for me and we'll dance on Khenarthi's graves.
Shh, Vijari, it's all right. Just sit with this one a while.
She is here.
Wait! Stop this, father!
Must you walk where Juisa just swept? You're as bad as her sister.
Swordthane! Why has work—?
Svana ….
I should have sensed it … Svargrim's a vampire!
I can't divulge such information. Even the great Lyris Titanborn must know that. It's a matter of royal security!
They're moving higher up the tower! We need to follow them!
Priest Bavian! Our own brethren have turned against us! They've become monsters!
What happened? What did that damned vampire do?
More than you. Care to try me?
Stop! A disaster has befallen Kilkreath Temple!
I've explored more tombs than I care to recall, and I've never seen a guardian like this.
We'll leave you to your grief, your highness.
It's Urlvar! Stay low!
There he goes! Follow him!
This is ridiculous! You can't waltz in here and accuse me of such a thing!
Alive again? How?
Careful. I sense the presence of other vampires.
Stand down, you idiots! We come in peace!
Ah! Wonderful!
Listen to yourself, Essenia. Even one life is too many! I can't make that kind of sacrifice. Not even for you.
Let us remember them with song and drink!
I did not betray my hold! She's the one who should face your judgment!
This must be the place. I'll go back and get—
Sod off. This is my patch of ground.
Mother—no! You can't die! Mother?
Like she did? If I determine Jorunn had a hand in this, there will be war! Someone take care of my wife!
Harrowfiends! Not the result of the ritual we stopped, so they must have brought them from someplace else.
SAT Music
Not so tough now, huh? What do you want with Maugh?
Definitely Dwarven. Watch out for traps.
Oh my, what is that incredible machine?
Come on, Fenn. We'll help you through this.
This place is connected to Castle Dour! How long has my father been planning this?
How could such a simple thing cause so much destruction?
We're close. I can practically feel the blood flowing in my veins! I'm tingling!
Well done, well done! Grab the power node!
By Meridia's light! So many dead ….
Steady! Steady! Not so rough!
Over here!
Don't worry. Helsi and I can take you to safety. This stranger will scout for Bjora.
Thane Svyne! Rigurt prepared an exquisite dish to cure your grumpiness!
Is that one of the Gray Reliquaries? We can't let them get away with it!
Hold, friend. You need to hear what I have to say.
Watch and learn, assistant!
Doesn't matter. Give chase. I'll search this laboratory, make sure he doesn't double back again. Two birds, one stone.
Hmm, curious. Spirits don't use trapdoors.
Follow him! Now, soldier, tell me exactly what happened.
But fret not, your people serve a higher purpose now. I have given them life anew.
I will not let my shame snuff out the power I have wrought. I must finish my work.
The harrowfiends, they've broken loose!
Who's that? If you came to eat me, you better turn right around!
That's nothing! I heard something happened in Karthald. Karthwatch was destroyed!
Look! They're both alive!
Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!
Now where did I put those runestones ….
Right. Well. You must be pleased with yourself. Just take me back to Solitude. Ridiculous ….
Quickly, you fools! They come for the reliquaries!
Stop them, my pack mates! I'll get this brew to the witches!
An attack on Solitude? We need to move quickly!
Arise, and destroy these fools!
We'll start with something simple. I buried an old bottle in the courtyard. Open your journal and have a look.
Glad to be rid of that worm. He deserved worse.
I'll hurry back to Scholar Diel's camp. Be safe!
I will return to Scholar Diel's camp. May Tall Papa guide your steps.
Take all the time you need. The Antiquarian Circle pays by the hour, after all.
Let's hurry to the cellar. I'm fairly certain I can get it unlocked.
Hey, you were in charge of the supplies.
Beneath stars and spheres? What does that even mean?
The keystone is only part of the puzzle. As you agreed, we must also awaken the Dark Heart.
Oh, I'll just await your return then.
Get the reliquary and meet me in the ritual chamber.
Have you found something I can cast my auramancy upon?
Father, it wasn't just your research that let him revive the Gray Host. The actual procedure was your creation!
Verandis! No!
Why Lost Valley, Nathari? What are you planning, my sister?
Gwendis needs your help with the Nighthollow rite!
No, no, no, no. No! You're damaging it! That's not how this should work!
You're closer than you think.
The shard amplifies the energy. Rotate it and focus the energy on another crystal.
Gods … in the sky. That must be the Darkstorm.
Will you really embrace death and damnation just to spite me, old friend?
If I don't stop the Darkstorm, then my death will be the least of our worries!
I don't want to owe you, Verandis.
Oh, you're here, too she-wo—ah, Titanborn. You come with me. I have a message for your ears alone.
Sheathe steel!
Ghostsong hunters loyal to Nathari? Surely some must have opposed her.
Souls can go anywhere! Imagine if they had the freedom to choose their destination, or even return to life.
Is that Count Verandis?
That door is clearly blocked. And that strange energy …? Wait. Is there something on the floor?
Nice welcome. Told you I smelled werewolves and alchemy.
You must be Arkasis.
Aha! I've gone beyond mere flesh and blood! I am transcendent! Ahahaha!
Music
Stars and spheres, of course. An orrery!
When the Darkstorm blows through the Void, everything we lost will be returned. Even your lives.
I know, Gwendis. We have much to discuss. Come, let us return to Ravenwatch Castle.
That portal should let you continue on the path.
Please, help Verandis … I see it now … the Lord of the Gray Host threatens …
Fiasof broke his bow over knee. He bowed to Hircine, asking for the great spirit's forgiveness.
Faolan, the Red Eagle, last drew his blade at sunset. Naked was his breast and arm and head. The light of his eyes dimmed, the hagraven's due.
Well, what is this? A stone ring in the gullet … a hunter's! So the beast bested one of the Reachfolk ….
The artifact is mine! You cannot fathom its power!
Their witches must have taken the vateshran! We have to help him.
The Dark Heart beats once more. Defy me, and die!
Do you smell that? The stench of smoke.
I know. Who'd have thought we'd owe our lives to that lot?
Witness my power!
The Eagleseer waif has poisoned your mind, boy. You shame me!
Finally. Let's get on with it already.
Aye.
Aye, that one I know. Very well, Verandis. I'll speak to them.
Hey! Over here.
I'll meet you outside the ruin, my friend.
Leki is laughing on the Far Shores, dancing with her mocking blade.
A Dwemer amplifier? Quickly, deactivate it! I'll contain the magic with a time slowing spell!
Hrokkibeg, the Mighty Bear. Between hunts, he reminds us of the value of solitude, peace from labors, and the quiet strength of our mortal souls.
Master Pythis! Stop this madness!
You! You need to die!
The tomb was opened and the eagle flew no longer.
Councilor Jirich! Damn, we're too late!
Whatever you did in the south wing didn't unlock the main doors.
Heard you might need a little help in here!
Over here, mercenary!
They were the chosen of Mehrunes Dagon, rewarded beyond their station.
This is my opposition? How easily I shall crush them!
We weren't expecting visitors. Are you here to see the councilor?
The sorcerer's goo lingers, like nose slime on a hatchling's claw.
Stibbons, I won't tolerate muck in my manor house!
Are you here to liberate Borderwatch? I might know something that can help!
We're going to review the lesson on following instructions.
Escapees? Not on my watch.
Something's wrong!
Sombren, what's going on here?
What? Why isn't it—? Good grief.
Flattery and cuteness will get you nowhere, Elf. Come, little mortal, I have information.
Thank you, governor. Ah, here's my partner now.
Look, behind the statue! A portal! Come on!
Stay close, friend. I'll feel better knowing you're nearby.
I'll help Calia and Destron. You deal with Xynaa.
Destron, help me open a portal. Like Sombren showed us on the hilltop.
That's horrible! We've got to do something.
Tumma-Maxath already uncovered the remains. Quickly, destroy them.
Is that—Damn it, they murdered Talaise, too!
Despite the smell I don't think that's a funerary urn. The ashes are too fresh.
Look out she's … Mighty Flicka? From the Saga of Captain Wereshark? That, I did not expect.
You're persistent, I'll give you that. All right, let's chat.
The ward has fallen. Let us see what waits inside.
That is the last one. Let's speak, beek-ojel.
Argonians and Imperials. It looks like they were fighting back to back, defending themselves. Their wounds are jagged, too.
Well, we have a portal. Now to find out if leaping into it turns out to be a good or bad idea.
We're too late. The location of the Ambition was sent to the high priest. But what was that about an attack on Leyawiin Castle?
Head for Renna's house. I'll be right behind you!
Oh … does it mean I don't have to go back to the library?
You have my word. If the councilor is in Leyawiin or the surrounding countryside, the Ivory Brigade will find her.
You accept my might … but are you worthy of it?
Three failures. I begin to fear I shall not find release this day.
Mathen! Why aren't you—? Mathen!
Ah ha! Easy enough.
Keep looking. We need to find a pedestal like the one those cultists used.
But she murdered you. You don't blame her for that?
Oh, wait. It's a person!
Thank the Divines! I thought I'd die down here.
You go no further!
Don't feed me to—wait you're not one of these marauders.
Emperor Leovic wrote that! But it's not in code. If those councilors know the secret, their lives are in danger!
You bested my follower, mortals, so I shall permit you to leave my realm with your lives. Step through the portal and begone!
Get me out of here!
Vandacia, how could you?
You're awake? Thank the stars.
There. That should unlock the door.
Well, this is upsetting.
Music
Music
Well, that did something, but not what I was hoping for.
Going somewhere? All right, I'll find you later.
See those wounds? My assassins did that! Then the cultists crawled back here to die. See if they're carrying anything important.
Now, bash the construct before it strikes!
When you're ready to show me to the other Ambitions, let me know. I'll lay low for a bit until then.
Lead the way, my friend.
Watch what those fancy arrows I found can do!
There's some conductive oil up here! Maybe you can use it.
Were you able to gather the silk?
Where does this piece go?
Well, it looks like Quistley's in luck. The ring is still here. He'd better be outside with my letter.
Not long now. I'm almost—oh. It seems we have company.
Oh hey, over here!
You cannot kill what cannot die!
Clairene! Are you all right?
I told you we were being followed, acolyte. Let's show them the true power of the Waking Flame!
This one hears and obeys! Death to the mortals!
So much rot and squalor. Will any record of Gavos or the anvil have survived?
Thank you.
Is this Edvilda? Someone killed her! Let's search the camp.
I happily offer my soul to Xalvakka ….
With the seal gone, we should be able to use the other door to exit this place, once I've said some final prayers for the abbey.
Inelegant but ever-changing.
You're back. Any luck?
I know. I am grateful to you all, but I had to take this chance.
Sul-Xan? They're a nasty bunch!
You can stuff the fetching house. Our family is more than just your legacy. Come on, mom. We're wasting our breath.
We're here mom, and we've brought granddad's puzzle box. Would you lay it on the shrine for her?
Hmm. Perhaps this was not such a grand idea.
Trade be. My work here is finally done.
No … Destron, is that us up there?
This letter is for you, mercenary.
Yes, Laur-ahn!
Stibbo make hurt now!
I misjudged you three. These artifacts deserve more worthy bearers.
The two of you are amounting to so little, Ihudir. Pull yourself together and fight!
Stop it from draining that vessel!
The device will work as intended, Nokvroz. Ah, here comes the devastator now.
Did you hear that? It sounded like it came from the furnace.
On your own? Who is Arox the Mutilator? Chopped Ogrim spittle?
I will forget you, too, Mairead. But I will leave you with my name. And I'll hold onto your father's amulet. If you ever need your memories, find me. The amulet is the key.
I remember! Mairead! Together we can destroy Nirn and set everything aright!
Others? How?
The blind old fool is useless! All he did was babble about nonsense.
That map was obviously drawn by a prisoner.
I'll meet you at Annihilarch's Summit. But we should be careful. I expect that both Sister Celdina and Nokvroz may be there.
All right Selveni, if you were an Energy Font, where would you be? The northwest? There are a lot of storms there.
Sombren, when I begin the merging, I will need the power of the Ambitions to complete it.
I have the power of all four Ambitions now. It feels like my head is going to burst.
Kneel, Rynkyus, or Valkynaz Nokvroz will erase your clan from existence.
Arox has returned! Run!
No matter. Arox is still Arox. I am with you, master! This way!
No! We won't let you take us! Not to your damn machine!
There is always another battle, but you need not seek it today.
Why concern yourself with this? We can outlast the mortals.
There must be a switch or something!
Keep an open mind. For the lies you have been fed will cause you to reject reality's true teachings.
Stop! The ritual must destroy the Daedra! My plan depends upon it!
Another memory fragment! Take it before it disperses.
The mortal woman dares command Jynd? And Nokvroz? Arrogant. Why does she need so many Dremora?
The spell has run its course. The glow will not return.
Sister Celdina got away and we're right back where we started. Nowhere!
Ooh, bile. Delicious. But probably not what you'd use to clear a mortal's mind.
I'm so used to running off to the next disaster, it feels strange to have a moment of peace.
I'll meet you in Fargrave!
You did well, regardless of where the powers of the Ambitions now rest.
It cost you nothing, mortal. As for what I paid, I'd rather not discuss it.
Over here! There's a dynamus font. Let's charge that lucent.
The Dremora? Coming here was a mistake, Lyranth!
Arrogant vermin!
Hey, partner! Up here!
Rynkyus spoke true. This place reeks of the mortal cultists.
We should be able to find a way inside through the undercroft. It runs beneath the bathhouse.
Ofallo, descend! Kill!
There! An overseer. Let's see what's going on.
Hey! What's happening?
There, master! The portal to the Warden's Overlook.
That worked! The lucent is charged! Now place it in one of the discharge labrums.
Ah hah! She had the letter. No sign of the medallion though.
Just stop for one moment and let me explain!
Still not big enough to contain your ego.
I sense a malevolent power near here. The choker must be close.
Just stay put! My friend is never going to catch up if you keep running off.
It's going to take a lot of bribery for me to forget this, Jakarn.
Forward, my warriors! The way to the mortal realm is clear!
Oh, nicely done, mortal.
You know my friend, the one who defected from the Waking Flame? He says something big is about to happen in the Deadlands.
Have you heard? They say Mehrunes Dagon invaded Nirn. But he was banished!
Burning dust, boiling land.
I heard they were prisoners in Nirn. Until some mortal climbed Annihilarch's Summit and freed them.
I'll be just outside the gate if you need me. Give it all you've got.
Wretched Spire? I'll meet you there.
Mairead. Have you come to fulfill your purpose?
All of you! Stay away from me! Stay away!
You're tougher than you look. Soldiers! Soften them up for me!
Time to clear you all out.
I don't see Tarrinore anywhere, but those are some of the scoria. Do you think they're cool enough to handle?
You know, struggling to get free and such.
Aww. I knew you cared.
Oh! Did you see that, Kaleen? What a fight!
Jakarn, free the captains. Friend, keep the Ascendant Order at bay! Buy us some time!
There was a storm off the coast. Perhaps it delayed the ships.
A few drops of dried blood? Hmm. A scuffle, but not a murder.
And finally we present the Oaken Order with the Staff of the Wild Woods, after solving the Wizard Erlibru's puzzle.
You did well, Isobel. It seems as though your second was a great boon to you today. Second, step forward. I'd like to speak to you.
Watch yourself, stranger. There's some errant magic out here.
That's one ward restored. Let's go fix the next one, it's in the glade just west of here!
Ah, there you are.
You found your way. Good.
Return to the village and tell the elders what the Evergrowth said. I'll join you momentarily.
Our ships are ready, my lord. We can attack All Flags Islet on your command.
I can, my lord. The alliance leaders will have nowhere to hide after I tear down their walls.
They know we took the royals to All Flags? And the Magus has ships ready to attack? We can't let him get away! Try the door to the right!
Your conversation distracted father long enough for me to escape out the front door!
All right, let's get in and out as quick as we can.
Stay here, I'll run up to the altar and get the celebration started.
Fish biscuits! That wasn't right.
Stranger, those stockade ruffians hauled away my husband! Can you help me?
No, too solid. Look for a large crack or something.
Right, that's settled. I hope you all have learned your lesson. Don't pay the bill to shady characters in a back room.
Ember? Help me!
That must be the relic! It's hurting her, we need to destroy it!
I could outrace you with my legs tied together!
Za'ji will keep lookout from the high ground!
<Stinger>
Welcome home, Dame Veloise. Thank you for coming. I need you to deal with a bit of a situation.
Oof …! Za'ji is not often considered overweight, but that roof thought otherwise.
We're right behind you.
A knight does not forget that it is their duty to serve others.
Oh bother! M'lady's gotten herself into terrible trouble!
See you at Lady Arabelle's camp!
Let's do this quick.
Please, dear lady. You've been dealing spirits across the island, I ask you to hear me out.
Slow down, friend. Lady Arabelle wants to see you.
Attack! Amunara commands you!
This isn't nerves, Sorinne. It's, uh … excitement! I always pace when I'm excited, you know that!
Scattered, I'm afraid. Queen Ayrenn was with us, but there was a great rumble and screams from below. She ran to help.
I think this is the door to the ancient crypts. But we'll need a key.
We can meet up at the Navire Chapel. The entrance to the catacombs is in there.
Good luck to you both!
Now we have all three keys! Let's return to the vault and see if we can open it.
Look at that natural bridge ahead! I bet the view is delightful.
Hmm, butterfly spirits are notoriously difficult to understand, but that was useful. I think. Let's continue.
Speak with the duchess, dear. I'll have a look around.
Ah, there you are. Find anything?
A knight does not nap when love is unrequited! No … wait. Sleep is good.
Less talk and more action, Ly. And do try harder this time, please.
Not your finest hour, Ly. Let me show you how it's done.
They say that Sir Brenvale died at the hands of a ghost. The old Mad Duke! Gives me the shivers.
A spriggan's veil, powerful symbolism.
Oh dear! Follow Lady Laurent! She's in no condition to wander off on her own!
There you are, dear. And with the alliance leaders, too! I assume you had something to do with the Ascendant Order's retreat?
Examine the historical plaques and see what you make of them.
Ah, what a sight, when the first ships of the All Flags Navy sailed into the upgraded harbor. I was aboard one of those vessels … and it was here that I met my lady love!
Let's find Queen Ayrenn, shall we?
Yeah, if I were to break an ankle making this jump, Queen Maraya would kill me. I'll go around and meet you outside.
Storm and fire will bring down the old regimes. Lightning and lava will herald in a new age!
The ruins of Port Sargo. Somewhat disconcerting, as long-deserted places tend to be. But there's a plaque. See what it says.
Hmm, the Pristine Halberd. The captain's name has been scratched off the plaques on the pedestal and on the wall.
Damn …. It's them. I knew it.
Honor to you, Razhamad. I, Teliv Fels, champion of the Mournhold Chapter, have come to extend the final tournament challenge.
Careful, I don't think that letter you found will work down here. We're going to have to fight.
As squires, Leobert and I fell asleep praying in front of that statue.
I can't believe it. An Ascendant Order sailed a fleet right into the loch! I heard there was a terrible battle at All Flags Islet.
And I heard that the important visitors were there. And they turned out to be the leaders of the three alliances! Good thing someone was there to defend them.
Brahgas belongs to me, Razhamad. You have more pressing concerns when it comes to property, I think. Your precious gaming hall, for instance.
Ziss'vo! Would you all quiet down? Kishka has work to do, yes? But yes, cheers to you walker.
I could hear the cheers from up here. Welcome back, champion!
Hold on, friend! I've got something for that beast!
Hah, probably a good idea. I'd hate to scare the stripes off him.
A wise sailor learns from their mistakes. Try once again.
Don't be surprised if you see me in Wayrest. That fetcher deserves some payback.
Hmm. That would explain some letters we've received.
Just let us know if you need any help sorting out where he went, all right? We love you too.
How does it feel, necromancer? You and your dishonorable ways came close, but not close enough.
This must be the place. Let's get in there. If they've hurt Marso, I swear to Stendarr ….
You will regret this. This one swears it.
Mother says Isobel has been a good influence. I guess there's something to that.
Draigh! I am going to bounce this Vetitia across the turf when we find her!
Weakness must be purged!
How could one so lowly take my life?
Please, I'm innocent I tell you! Don't send me into the jungle!
Too late for that. You've all been processed. If we don't banish you into the jungle, you'll die.
Ha! You made that look easy! Suck eggs, Fabermund!
Yeah! Well played! Well played! You're off to the final round!
Well, well! The cards you drew gave you both gold and power. Power has two uses—the first is combat. But it also turns into Prestige at the end of your turn. Remember, earning Prestige is how you win!
Go ahead back to the gaming hall and let Brahgas know I'm coming. This old life … I'm done with it.
Those bones! Now we know why they call it Whalefall.
Come into the maze and find me … if you can.
Wait, I'm coming with you!
Perfect. That'll do nicely.
Keep the corruption going.
I think you should move along, stranger. This fishing hole's closed.
If I just knew this land better, I'd go find him myself! Blighted Firesong!
He was a blight and a thorn, but still. May the dirt take Archdruid Devyric into its embrace.
Oh, really. And why should I trust you?
No, Dhulef. I think I need to take Frii to the Stonelore Circle. They belong with the druids.
Frii belongs with druids, yes, yes. Purpose and stone, rain and sun.
Excellent, another breach. We're back in.
Pull the lever when you're ready.
Do not feel bold too quickly!
The Ascendant Lord is recruiting disillusioned druids after the events on Galen? Insidious!
The time has come to gather the seeds. The prophecy of the Druid King is at hand.
The seeds? Is that what this—oh, blight! She's gone. Friend, we should talk.
A lorekeeper? What relic could they be searching for?
Roneiia must be here somewhere. And likely, she's not alone. Time to put on our serious faces, my friend.
Captain Uldiss must be inside. Careful, friend. We'll follow as best we can.
Gah! And now my camp is crushed!
Gwenaelle! You're back!
Everything is fine, Gwenaelle. Outsider, come. We owe you so much!
Hello! Over here! I'm waving my … oh, crud.
The Chronicle saved you, in its own way.
Go on ahead. Frii and I will meet you near Ivyhame.
Be careful. I don't think we're alone down here.
Right away, Count Stefan!
Not well. The city's been overrun.
Maybe you spoke too soon, Caska. Look who it is.
Archdruid Ellic, allow me to escort you to the cathedral. Friend, I'll rejoin you once the archdruid is safe.
If you know your heading, go on ahead. I'll keep an eye on the bird, and we'll meet up with you soon.
What's happening over there?
Firesong druids. Proceed with caution, dear.
You wouldn't dare!
Let's regroup outside Fauns' Thicket. Leave the herd to find the berries on their own.
Frii used an ancient druid trick. I've seen this before. There should be two druid stones in here. If we turn them, the ward should dissipate.
That's the tree. Frii was quite fond of it.
The seeds! Archdruid Orlaith approaches. Hide, friend of Laurel. Hide!
All these long seasons, the door has waited just for me.
Ah Eyfi, isn't this place wondrous? I am positively enchanted by the primitive styles of the architecture. What could it all mean?
Wait, what was that?
These are the tunnels my father mentioned! The Sea Elves are already here! We must find Archdruid Ellic!
Look. The Green has not forsaken this place of stone. There are flowers. Insects. Life.
Sir Stefan! The Firesong hold our folk in Cinderwash, just as you thought. No sign of Archdruid Orlaith though.
I'm simply suggesting that you bring your people into the city. The Vine District has room enough for more druids.
I'm afraid so, Fayda. Sometimes religious conviction can drive even the best of us to do terrible things.
Over here, mate!
The seeds are near. Their presence calls. Be cautious. We will soon be upon them.
Five-claw! Za'ji has found you!
Over here, my dear. Count Stefan and I have something for you.
SAT Music
Brennoc sent you to me, did he?  Good, I may have use of you...
Aha! Good work! Generations of orcs will admire what you've helped create.\n\nI've heard more good news as well. General Godrun said there's another battle coming. Bring it on, I say!
He's still under a sleep spell.\n\nBut I've learned something. The Midnight Union wanted us to panic. The attack, the fires … they were just a diversion. While we were distracted, they entered the abbey and stole the Dream Shard.
Well, I'm glad you decided to do so today. You will always, always be welcome at the Vanne farm.\n\nStay as long as you like.
Tu'whacca says you should not worry. He says you will find them. I can watch over The Ward of Ansei Radan for now. \n\nTu'whacca has much faith in you, my friend. He wants me to give you this. You should be honored.
The king has waited too long. So many warriors have died, and Marimah holds onto life by a thread.\n\nWe will answer the king's call to the best of our ability, but I fear we can do very little. You should speak to Talia if you haven't already.

So Gloria was right. I suppose I should have known. At least we'll be better prepared this time.\n\nAnd it seems I'm once again in your debt.
Ah, the pain fades ….\n\nThat was blood, wasn't it? You gave me Gloria's blood, didn't you? Just one more thing Faolchu must pay for.
Oh, my apologies. You must be the stranger who helped my sisters at Deleyn's Mill.\n\nI'm honored to meet you.
I thought as much. That's the story our family has passed down through the ages, but I needed proof. Now Camlorn must be told. \n\nYou know, what you've done here has changed everything. Maybe more than we know.
Fire! Of course. That makes perfect sense. The beast can't stand against its purifying flame.\n\nWith your help, we will set Camlorn free and destroy Faolchu once and for all.
"Ash Farm is ours! The Pact's heroes may collect their rewards here.\n\n- Grand Warlord Zimmeron"
The good news is I do indeed have the master key to the city gates. \n\nThe bad news is your thrilling exploits have attracted Faolchu's attention.
I renounce the cult and promise to honor my ancestors. But from a much safer distance. \n\nI'll make my way out of here. Maybe go to Daggerfall or start a new life somewhere else. No more cults for me. Not even benign ones!

First one to reach Angof buys the first bottle of wine!\n\nBut in all sincerity, thanks for helping us. You really are an inspiration. And I should know, seeing as I'm pretty inspirational myself.
The new lizard is just the draw this track needs. And, I spoke with <<1>> as well. She'll help me with the track for a small investment.\n\nMeeting you turned my life around! May Tall Papa guide your steps!
The gemstones …? Thank you so much! \n\nI am surprised you … well, I am simply grateful. I have spent so many years searching in the darkness and found nothing. My luck has finally changed.
Interesting; we'll have to make plans to ensure that farm is denied to our enemies.
Truly Stendarr's mercy has descended on my family today. My son has been returned to me, and <<1>> is recovering from her wounds.\n\nPlease take this as a reward. Without your help, <<2>> might not have survived. Go in peace.
Yes, well. Ahem. I thank you for all you've done here today, traveler. My daughter is safe and I must … reluctantly … admit that the Argonian may have played a part.\n\nMay Lord, Mother, and Wizard all guard you on your journey.
Then perhaps you understand how delicious revenge can be. Every insult and every slight must be returned in kind.\n\nYou honor us, friend. Take this and kill any who may wrong you!
He didn't know why? If he was willing to attack and kill us without even questioning his orders, he's better off dead.\n\nWell done. Thank you, outsider.
No, she is not destroyed. Only silenced for a time.\n\nShe is old, perhaps as old as the swamps themselves. I do not know what caused her to take an interest in the living, but this does not bode well for any of us.
You should take the vessel to the wispmother. She is powerful right now, so first, you must weaken her.\n\nThen open the vessel, so it can take in her corrupted soul.
When presented with a miracle, Redguards normally thank Tall Papa. But he didn't show up down here to untie me. So. \n\nThanks go to you, my friend. The Covenant owes you a debt.
Yes, he did, and he told me a most peculiar tale. \n\nI owe you for getting him out of this mess. Take these coins. It's the least I can do.
Well done! Now the Supernal Dreamers should trouble us no more.
No, you fool! Now Test Realm will be subjugated by summoned daedra for ages!\n\nJust take what I have left and go.
We'll head back to Windhelm and rest before marching to join the rest of the army.\n\nTake this. It was a charm to bring me luck in the war. Thanks to you, my luck has been pretty good. I want you to have it.
That was an admirable showing. Even in defeat, you represented Windhelm and the Pact with honor.\n\nSadly, Hadring was murdered during the race. Felled by a poisoned arrow of Orcish design. I'm convinced the Stormfists are responsible.
That took far too long!  But thank you for bringing back what is rightfully mine.
You've broken their power here. They may find another way, but we will be ready for them this time.\n\nFor now, we must rest. Thank you for aiding us, though we are outcast. Perhaps we will meet again.
I give you this as payment for services rendered. You are strong and I respect that.\n\nFeel free to visit as often as you like. I shall happily provide you with power whenever you wish.
Well. They'll be stuck in there for Y'ffre knows how long. At least the sphere's safe from the Sea Vipers.\n\nThe stormwardens won't forget your help. May the storm travel before you, as they say.
With this group? Without a doubt! We'll make our way overland to Vulkwasten.\n\nWe'd have been lost without you, and the Maormer would know our secrets. This rescue brings great honor to your name, my friend. May Auri-El guide you.
Hardly a scratch! I still don't have any idea what to make of this ore, but the residual dust could be useful. \n\nI'll go up to the mine and talk to Jomund. I need more samples. This dust may be valuable, even if I don't fully understand it yet.
Because of you, I've finally joined my sisters. I feel like we're old friends already.\n\nPerhaps the four of us can heal the spriggans and drive the Worm Cult away for good. It'd be like being the Green Lady once again!
I'm glad you've come. Help is vital at this time of crisis.
I couldn't wait for them. Ran ahead, too far ahead. Impatience. My curse! The captain … if she's alive ….\n\n<<1>>'s in charge. She's got to … to save Velyn Harbor now.
Yes! This is going to be epic, my friends. Epic!
We haven't spoken in years. As much as I would wish otherwise, I know what I have to do.\n\nThank you. My mother is smiling in Sovngarde today.
I hope my sisters fared as well on their missions.
You've no idea. I'll take them from here. Thanks for keeping them safe. Good to know not everyone in this country is defenseless.
I'm impressed. Taking out those officers threw the Lion Guard camps into chaos. That gave our reinforcements the distraction they needed to surround the valley. It's all clean up from here on out.\n\nWe couldn't have done this without you.
Incredible. I knew you had potential, Gorak, but I never imagined you were so capable.\n\nThank you for your help, friend, though it sounds like Gorak didn't really need it.
Yes, I know of the place. My former master spoke of it once. Its presence annoyed him so.\n\nI'll go with the mages. Perhaps I'll even help them if they run into trouble. You never know. Find me when you're ready to do something significant.
I will tell the troops; morale will improve greatly. Sometimes I feel more like a nursemaid than a troop commander.\n\nThank you.
Sneak up on you? It's what I do. Howler draws all the attention, I do all the sneaking.
I regret I must complete my work here before considering additional opportunities. I must find a way inside Bthzark!
I won't let her live like this, Hallowed. I won't. You and I are going to walk the Path together. We'll destroy Tharn and I will return with the most powerful sages in Tamriel. Together we'll free my sister from this torment.
It's all we have to hold on to right now. I … have my doubts, but I need to stay strong for <<1>>.\n\nBut even so, this was all worth it. Just to know there're still good people in this world. People like you.
Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … and Mathal's, wherever he may be.
We were attacked. Savaged by a dark creature … and I think it was a Khajiit. The Mane!
And I'm damned proud to be standing with you. Ahem. All right, enough of emotion. Let's walk the Moons-damned Path and see this through. The way Shazah would have wanted.
I know it's a lot to take in. We'll talk more later.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll keep an eye on the Prophet. Hopefully that orb will help him find out where Sai Sahan is being held. Once we know that, we can plan our next move.
You're right. It has to be done. It has to.
Good news. Good news indeed. I was feeling a bit parched on this beach. Ale's run dry, you see.\n\nI know several hard-working lads back in Anvil. I'll see they throw a proper … hero's welcome for <<1>>. My thanks for your service.
Ha! And you're worried I won't hold up my end of the bargain? \n\nNo no. I keep my promises. You got rid of those parasitic Orcs—you've earned the right to petition the Wilderking for an audience.
We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.\n\nI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again.
During our time together, we determined that the Dwarven device operates on the same principles as Molag Bal's Planemeld. Zur will honor the Dark Elf's memory and give him credit for this discovery.\n\nThank you again for saving us, my friend.
This is it … your chance to take on the Grand Champion. May the luck of Jone and Jode be with you.
Great. A fan.\n\nI need you to keep quiet!
Ha! That sneaky Tamien fellow sure will be surprised.\n\nHopefully now, Lady Laurent will forgive me and realize we don't need any hired help. A mercenary … what in Oblivion was she thinking?
Well, if anyone can survive the planes of Oblivion, it's a Vinedusk Ranger.  Nara's tougher than wood.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts.
That sack of skooma bought your freedom, and a reward for your cooperation.\n\nNow, stand aside. I've got business with these Khajiit.
I'm a skeleton of me word, so here, take this. \n\nNow be off with ya. I got some vengeance to bestow on them what busted me up.
Good! As you can see, I have <<1>>. With my help, he might even become a good swindler someday.\n\nAnything would be better than staying in that camp. It's difficult to be the daughter of a man known as "the Ungodly."
She … what? Where is this tribe? I can't just let her go. I … I will join her. I can live in the forest. I … who am I kidding? \n\nThis is my fault. Our relationship was always harder on her than it was on me. At least I know she's okay.
I wish you'd accompanied her, but she is strong. Like … like a stampede of mammoths.\n\nI know, I should stick to administrative work. Thank you so much.
Excellent. I wish I could see the look on Angore's face when I take these to market. I bought them, fair, after all.\n\nThank you for your help. Here's what I owe you. Unlike Angore, I keep to a deal.
Thank Stendarr! Things were getting tense. I know you're not the Artisan, thanks to our careful investigations. You're free to go now.\n\nWe'll return the items back to their original owners.
Old Raz sent you, eh? That could complicate things. Thank you for telling me. The Queen's enemies are all around her. Her protectors must be vigilant at all times, and this information will be critical in their calculations.
You may return here as often as you like, and anywhere you see the shrine of the Wolf, you may seek Brackenleaf's blessing.\n\nCongratulations, friend.
I witnessed the Titan's assault and sensed the deaths of many innocents. It is a great and terrible loss.   \n\nSai Sahan and the others will need time to aid Kasura. I will contact you when they return and we will begin the journey to Sancre Tor.
The Veiled Heritance were using my notes? No. What have I done?\n\nI was young and foolish when I wrote these notes. I just wanted to save my wife from a consuming plague. I should've destroyed them then. I will destroy them now. Thank you.
Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands.
A letter? From my cousin? That's wonderful news! I'm glad to hear he made it to Stonefalls safely.\n\nThanks for bringing this to me, friend.
Thank you. You've given me much peace. \n\nI think I'll to make it my personal crusade to repopulate the spriggans here. I'll find some in Glenumbra and Viridian Wood to bring back. So perhaps we will cross paths again.
As long as the two of you weren't injured. That would have been tragic.\n\nWell, we'll all sleep a little better knowing that the dead have been laid to rest. Take this as a token of my appreciation.
Were you indeed?\n\n<<1>> sent you from <<2>>, did she? A bit dramatic of her, but she does have an eye for talented people. Perhaps you could put your talents to use.
No, no. You know what? Don't apologize. This is just what I needed to hear. I'll go straight away to talk to Lorbash at the smithy. This is a new chapter for me!\n\nThank you for setting me straight, stranger.
His lordship, the Baron over there, wants us to head inside, see what's going on, and secure the area. He wants us to be slow and careful so as not to damage his precious city.\n\nGood job getting that key, by the way. Now let's go save Northpoint.
You did? I mean, good! Good. Well, now. Hopefully we can pack up and move out before another Imperial patrol finds us.\n\nYes. Thank you for your help. Thanks.
Yes, I remember you! A familiar face is a welcome one in dire times.\n\nYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me.
<You find <<1>>'s reward nestled underneath the first layer of stones.>
Of course. I would be happy to accept the offering. \n\nStrange as it may sound for someone to make an offering to a Daedric Prince, there are actually many who do so, hoping for Azura's blessing. I believe she obliges them when she can.
I should have expected such initiative from the queen's chosen. Tracking down Vicereeve Pelidil will take time. That is my responsibility as the Staff of Magnus disappeared on my watch.\n\nI will keep the queen apprised of our actions.
Narsis? Damn! I have family in Narsis.\n\nWell, keep an eye out for anymore of those Maulborn fetchers. There's bound to be more of them skulking about the countryside.
I know. But still, it's so terrible. Whatever the source of this curse, you must find a way to end it.\n\nI will take Nahlia back to the main camp. Thank you for helping us.
Oh yes, my friend. Like the corrupted vines he so loved to plant, Angof's villainy reaches into the farthest corners of my kingdom. I order you to pluck out these lingering threats in my name.\n\nI shall never forget your service this day, however.
And you look perfectly healthy. How … irksome. I suppose my wayward acolytes weren't as powerful as I thought. I'll need to be more diligent in my training of their replacements.\n\nStill, my lord Satakal thanks you. May his coils guide your steps.
A reasonable request. Take your key, and your cut. When next we speak, tomorrow, I will put more faith in your sword arm.
Certainly. You're more than qualified to fulfill woodworking crafting writs. I'll certify you immediately.
Hmph. I had hoped to learn the secret to your trotter pie.\n\nNo matter, I'll certify you immediately. You may now fulfill provisioning writs. Try not to poison anyone.
<A decrepit satchel of supplies sits inside the box, a note attached to the flap.>\n\n"The Daedra we acquired this from have no further need for it. We're sure it will be better off in your hands."
<The organization gathered enough supplies to offer you a case as a reward. They also included a note of thanks.>\n\n"The war has displaced so many refugees. Thanks to crafters such as yourself, at least some of them can defend themselves tonight."
<A decrepit case of woodworking supplies sits inside the box, a note attached to the lid.>\n\n"Your wonderful work has made our job in Coldharbour easier than we imagined. Accept these supplies we commandeered as compensation for your efforts."
<A representative of the Dragonstar Caravan Company left this pack of rewards and a note of thanks.> \n\n"There's nothing like good food to make the long desert nights bearable. Thank you."
<Officers of the Daggerfall Covenant have set aside a pack of goods as thanks for your contribution.> \n\n"This is just what the troops needed to get them through another hard campaign against the damned Eagles. Thank you!"
<The refugee organization has managed to gather a pack of rewards for your donation. There is also a note of thanks included.> \n\n"Fighting on the edge of Cyrodiil was brutal this week. Your goods will give hope where only there was despair."
A pleasure doing business with you. It's a shame about Khoruzoth, but there's nothing we can do about that. Better that his mother lives with the hope that he might come home some day.\n\nAs for Bardun and me, we'll be off soon. Best of luck to you.
So. Yes. I'll hold onto the key for now. I suspect we'll need it sooner rather than later.\n\nThank you for recovering it—and for finding Regilus. I'm glad someone was there. At the end.
Ah, well some is better than none. These are in remarkable condition, all things considered.\n\nYou've done me a great service. No—you've done all of Tamriel a great service, though they may never know it. You have my deepest thanks.
<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>
I'm not sure which pleases me more. Either way, the workers get to eat—and not a minute too soon. These immigrants bleat like goats when they're hungry.\n\nDon't stray too far, all right? I'm sure we'll need more meat soon. Thanks again.
<The client provided a crate of Blacksmith supplies as payment, along with a note.>\n\n"The Orsinium Civic Renewal and Vengeance Committee appreciates your work. These supplies now go toward renewing the city of Orsinium. Malacath curse your enemies!"
<The client provided a crate of Enchanting supplies as payment, along with a note.>\n\n"The Orsinium Civic Renewal and Vengeance Committee appreciates your work. These supplies now go toward renewing the city of Orsinium. Malacath curse your enemies!"
Apinia is dead, so she won't slaughter any more citizens. That will please Queen Ayrenn, which pleases Raz. And we recovered Bravil's trinkets. A good day's work, yes?\n\nThis one might stick around. Look into Trading Company. Stay fragrant, my friend!
Looks like it's seen better days, but I'm sure that's no fault of yours. I'll have it mended and return it to its rightful owner. He's a good man, and if this will bring him some comfort I'm glad we could help.\n\nAnother job well done.
Daggerfall has these curious little sausages in a sweet brine. Addictive as Skooma and twice as tasty. Reminds me of a contract. Client wanted the target's pinkies sliced off. Ah, memories!\n\nNext time, bring back a few sausages. Here's your gold.
Wonderful! Once I get the new dig underway, I'm sure we'll make progress quickly. I can't believe that not long ago, this was just a smoking hole in the ground. Now we may have uncovered the complex that gave Tribune's Folly its name!
Let's see how many that actually is … Hm. Thought it would be more.\n\nIt's easy arithmetic, at least. Here's your gold.
Let's see how many that actually is … Hm. Thought it would be more.\n\nIt's easy arithmetic, at least. Here's your gold.
Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort. \n\nIf we keep this up, the whole Landing will know that the Thieves Guild is back.
Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort.
I never could understand Nord politics. It seems to involve lots of yelling and copious amounts of mead. Still, if they're willing to pay for our services, who am I to complain?\n\nHere. For you.
We're a scary bunch, I'll grant you that. But with bloodfiends, werewolves, and so much else, what's another horror lurking in the shadows for a place like Rivenspire?\n\nYour employer seems satisfied, so I guess you were suitably frightening. There.
Good. The local bumpkins can return to calling it "Grandmother's Respite," or whatever fool name they used to give it.\n\nUntil the <<mz:1>> fail. And when they do, I'll have more work for you.
Restored the Apex Stone? Incredible! Then my predictions were more accurate than I expected and you've done more than I could have asked. \n\nI'll keep the amulet safe here among the Star-Gazers for now. There may be more we can learn from it.
I suspect it will be a long time before the people of Elinhir trust mages again—and with good reason. The city is in ruins and it's our fault.\n\nI'll seal off the mage towers and help rebuild the city. If they'll let me, that is.
I find this offering to be acceptable. Inside the gem, you can see the celestial bodies in their courses.\n\nThe text says the constellations are gods. They can be brought to earth using stones carved from Aetherium. Make of that what you will.
Hah! Spit in Mephala's face and crushed her greatest minion like a bug! I could kiss you if you weren't covered in Daedra spittle.\n\nMaybe I'll make it up to you tomorrow. Until then, settle for your key and cut.
I used to spar with legionaries before the war. They were fearsome enough in a practice ring. I hope they didn't cause you any trouble in Bangkorai.
Truly, I couldn't have done this without you and Eoki. A plan is only as useful as the people who carry it out. You have my deepest thanks, sera.\n\nNow … I suppose it's time!
Absolutely terrifying. To think, <<Ac:1>> was found among rogue soldiers. What a terrible thing to confuse for a canteen.
As my next sermon shall proclaim, "Modesty is the false cloak of a flatterer or the sincere garment of the humble."\n\nAgain, you have my gratitude and that of all my people. Indeed, even those who rail against the Tribunal owe you their lives.
Well, of course! In my experience my loyal subjects adore being showered in the affections of their king.\n\nOh—ah, don't share that with the queen.
Oh goodie! I'm so glad I've piqued your interest!\n\nNow, how best to have you serve your Queen … I know!
As promised, here's your payment. I even threw in some extra for going above and beyond what we could have ever asked of you.\n\nIf we ever decide to start an official Ghost Hunters Guild, you'll be the first to know, my friend.
<He notes your work and tenders payment.>
The Nord-songs claim you waded through the enemy like the wrath of Molag Bal, took that bull warlord by the horns, and pitched him clear over the Jerall Mountains. You can show me how you wrestled him down after a few drinks.\n\nTake your spoils.
Good. Let's hope those warding stones hold. I would hate to see a beast like that return.\n\nIn any event, this will bring the people of Russafeld some comfort. You continue to defy expectations, newcomer. Well done.
Excellent. It's somewhat of a shame to kill such powerful beasts, but of course Summerset citizens come first. I'll let my superiors know the area is safe once more.\n\nThough helping the Isle is its own reward, here's a more substantial offering.
Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business.
Let's keep our voice down, shall we?\n\nSo, the hulkynd disappoints once again. How utterly expected. As the one who delivered my parcel, I suspect you'll want the reward. Have it and be off with you.
I see. Well, at least I won't have to begin my marriage negotiations anew. As long as Niralin's willing to put this incident behind her, all will be well.\n\nHere's your payment, for a task well completed and your … discretion on the matter.
Oh, he put you up to that, didn't he? Papa always loves to embellish his journeys.\n\nWhatever the truth is, I'm just glad you brought him home safe. If all newcomers are so kind, Summerset will be fortunate to have you.
With Admiral Viscarne dead, now is the time to strike. I shall rally my people and call Sunnawel to my side. We'll form a resistance the likes of which these sea snakes have never known.\n\nThank you for making this all possible.
These animals deserve better than to be left to fend for themselves. I owe them that much.\n\nI'll do everything I can for them. You have my word.
My, don't these beauties look tempting. Perhaps I'll have a few sips. Just to get me going before I set off on the road. \n\nHere's your reward, for services rendered and all that.
Yes, given your experience with the craft, that seems to be in order. \n\nI am pleased to officially certify you in the art of jewelry crafting. You are free to fulfill any writs you may find at your leisure.
Most certainly. I hereby ordain you officially certified in the art of jewelry crafting. You may begin fulfilling writs immediately.\n\nHere's a small reward to get you started in your journey.
Hunting down a murderous indrik, tearing out its heart, and then taking that trophy back from your strongest rival? Now that's a worthy tale.\n\nTake your spoils. You earned them.
Then the last remnants of the old ways have finally been shed and the story of Shuxaltsei ends as it was always meant to: with a new beginning.\n\nWe are grateful for your help. The Hist were wise to guide you to us.
Yes, yes, we'll get to that. But first, payment for services rendered! You helped me acquire the Kajin-Jat Crystal and recovered two Argonian treasures besides! Peerless work, my friend. Peerless!\n\nPlease, take this payment with my compliments.
I suppose you're right. I was as much a part of my tribe as any branch of our Hist.\n\nHere, your reward. Thanks to your actions, I feel as though I can finally find peace. And, after so many years of mourning, that is no small thing.
The war is far from over. Even a queen needs to consult with such learned personages as Gharesh-ri and Abnur Tharn every now and then.\n\nTake this in recognition of your efforts on our behalf, five-claw. Then talk to Gharesh-ri. I need … to think.
Now we go our separate ways. Take Tasnasi's advice: leave the Stitches before it falls apart completely. \n\nThis one has no great sum of wealth, but she owes you something for saving her skin. Unlike most in these parts, Tasnasi remembers her friends.
I think I'll stay here a while. The adepts of the Hidden Moon still have a great deal to teach us, it seems.\n\nAs for you, the Moonlight Blade remains in your care. Wield it justly, and never forget what we accomplished here. Azura guide you, friend.
<A scrap of paper is pinned to the crate.>\n\n"The Orsinium Home for Displaced Children wishes you a blessed and bountiful New Life Festival, as you have provided for our wards." — Oorga gra-Shazgul, Headmistress
It is not for her to decide. If Khajiit lost their faith in her, she would not be surprised. This one will beg forgiveness for her failings and accept the will of her clowder. She was too reliant on her gifts and a leader must be more than a prophet.
As promised, your reward. \n\nWe appreciate your help. Here's a little something for the effort.
Zahari hopes they take such a lesson to heart. Our needs are great and the time to train is frightfully little to prepare against this Dragon invasion.\n\nThank you for your help on this matter.
Killing a Dragon's worth bragging about, even with Selene's help. From what I heard it'd already killed an army of Wood Elves before you arrived. They'll be cheering your name all over Grahtwood for slaying that monster.
Would a fool live in constant sickness to prove his devotion? Would he travel Tamriel with an idiot in a hopeless attempt to convince others to do the same? It sounds worse when I say it out loud ….\n\nIn any case, I owe you. Please accept this gift.
Then the King of Thieves was watching over you! Let's see, let's see … ah, yes this will do. Yes, yes, yes. Fine offerings for Rajhin.\n\nDo not forget yourself when dividing spoils or Rajhin will think you a fool. Good thieves always take their cut.
Good! We can only hope that she will remain dead this time, yes? Old Ri'hirr is tired of foes getting back up all the time!\n\nHere's your payment. Be well, five-claw.
Wherever Sormund takes us, yes? After years of waking to the same nightmare, Daini could do with a surprise or two.\n\nSpeaking of nightmares, thank you for ridding Daini of hers. Knowing that Turo lies dead … it lightens the soul. Farewell, walker.
<A scrap of paper is pinned to the crate.>\n\n"Nordic tribes living in Skyrim's harshest environments thank you, and we wish you a fruitful New Life Festival." — FC
I can't even begin to understand what just happened, but I think we have you to thank for keeping us from being tossed around all of creation with no rhyme or reason.\n\nOnce the room stops spinning, we're leaving. Even if I have to carry Raynor out.
Rada showed us the door and we forged the key. I have to follow. I have to stop the Darkstorm. For as you have seen from Rada's auramancy, this monstrosity is my creation.\n\nWhether you decide to accompany me or not, know that I value our friendship.
Wish I could have been there when you smashed up that fancy villa. Nothing makes me smile faster than tearing apart opulent homes. Especially in the service of taking down a haughty dolt like Pyroturge Encratis.\n\nJust feels good, you know?
The Shehai … it's a sacred and private thing to a Redguard. I tried to help Sai. Told him what I thought. What happens next? That's up to him.\n\nThanks for your help, partner. If we're keeping score, I owe you. A lot. Now I need to talk to Sai.
In some tales, Gulibeg's swift bite weakens his adversaries. Then he tricks them into falling from a cliff or drowning in a river. Perhaps that's what happened to the raider.\n\nNo matter. We have the relic, thanks to you. Take this for your efforts.
Our witches will make good use of these, harrier. They will employ this knowledge to better defend the Reach against our many enemies.\n\nTake this. May it protect you on the road ahead.
Marvelous! Elsweyr is a land both majestic and terrifying, wouldn't you agree? The Khajiit are so full of life. Theirs is a culture unlike any other in Tamriel.\n\nHere's your reward, brave adventurer. I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Oh, right. Of course. Deet-Loh would still be digging up grubs if not for you. You deserve this.\n\nNot many strangers would stop to help an Argonian who talks to pigs. Thanks again.
I guess I'll stay in Gideon until we put this matter to rest for good. I want to see these people's faces when they come to terms with what really happened! Then? It's back to Bravil and my woodshop! Sooner the better!\n\nThanks, hero. For everything.
Maybe. I hope so. Whether my friends and I will ever be able move past all this? That's another matter.\n\nHere's your reward. Without your help, well … there's no telling what my lady is capable of. Thank you, and may the shadows guide you.
Daedra don't need help. Why fight for us? I thought mortals valued their own kind. \n\nI will take him back to town. We need to stabilize it. Make it the same as it was. Nothing must threaten my protection. You completed the task. Here's the payment.
Verdam will be relieved to know you've dealt with the Mantikora problem. I'll just … let one of the apprentices know that I have the samples and this matter will be settled. \n\nAs promised, here's your reward.
Predictable. She always makes things harder for herself. Still, she managed to find it, perhaps she does display some aptitude. I may hire her again when she reforms.\n\nMortal, take this as payment for your efforts and go with Madam Whim's gratitude.
Disappointing. Without the stolen item, no restitution can be made. I must account for that in my judgement of these thieves.\n\nBut I would not be able to pass judgement at all without your assistance. Here, your reward, as the Stricture dictates.
Ah, aren't they beautiful? One for each delegation invited to the peace talks. And this is for you. Take it with my thanks.\n\nAnd know that the Society of the Steadfast's coffers are very deep. You'll be paid very well for your continued assistance.
And neither do we. We're not even sure they're still alive, but we must hope.\n\n Your help has been invaluable thus far, my dear, and you've earned every piece of gold in this pouch. We'll find the alliance leaders and unmask the Order. We have to.
Ember the Sorcerer. Heh, I like the sound of that. But that can come later. First, take this. It's not much but you deserve it.\n\nI think we made a good team today. If you ever need a sorcerer who has your back, let me know.  We'd have some fun.
Very well! A single sugar-tart is better than no tarts at all, yes?\n\nHere it is. Enjoy your reward, walker.
Storming an unknown Dwarven base usually ends in someone gutted by a trap. But you? I bet you didn't even give it a second thought. That's what makes you truly Undaunted! Take this reward with pride.
Now we make use of the time we have and prepare the city's defenses. Gather allies and do what we can to keep the sacred seeds safe. But no matter what happens, I'm honored to fight by your side.\n\nHere, friend. My father wanted you to have this.
Excellent. I knew you were the right one to ask for help. Thank you, adventurer. You've given us a welcome reprieve for now. Let us hope to be rid of this threat once and for all someday.\n\nHere, take this with the Stonelore Circle's thanks.
Oh, Zeht's tears, my eyes are already watering! I hope you're ready for a fiery demonstration, friend! It's about to get hotter than the Alik'r during Sun's Height!\n\nStep back, and watch me pave Galen's streets with flavor!

Skillful fishermen will learn to use the optimal bait for the type of fish they are trying to catch.
When you become |cFF0000KOS|r, your only option is to retreat until your |cFFFFFFBounty|r| and |cFF0000Heat|r| decrease. Any Guards you encounter while |cFF0000KOS|r will kill you, seize all |cFF0000stolen|r items from your inventory, and deduct whatever gold you are currently carrying from your |cFFFFFFBounty|r.\n\nIf you don't have enough gold to pay your entire |cFFFFFFBounty|r|, the Guard will take what you have on you, leaving the balance unpaid. Gold kept in Tamriel's banks cannot be taken by Guards.
Go to the Collections menu, select Stories, and select Zone DLC. Then accept the Thieves Guild quest. This will direct you to find Quen, a thief who is known to frequent Outlaw Refuges across Tamriel.
Yes, outsider?
I think my scribs have taken a shine to you, friend!
Do it!
What are you doing? No!
No! By Hircine's might, no!
Fight on!
Fight on!
The Pact soldiers say we can't go back to our homes yet. Too much danger of collapse.
A beautiful weapon!
Lazy beast!
The trees in Eastmarch are very different from what I'm used to.
Oh Tirora, what have they done?
I won't let you past me, Aldmeri dog!
Practicing archery's more fun than cleaning the stables.
Restless spirits wander the Coiled Path.
No, don't go there! Not into the river!
The Ra Gada really tore through here.
Go go go!
Hlaalu does what it always does. Nothing!
Higher! Strike higher! Don't worry about defense!
I hope and pray that the land will be restored to its natural balance soon.
Jurak-dar does not know why he bothers sometimes. Relics are old! I do not guarantee their potency!
Those idiot Forebears say we're stuck in the past!
Move along, citizen.
Prisoners give you any trouble, gut 'em.
I never wanted to raise a sword against my fellow knights. I feel terrible about what happened here.
Yes, this one likes fish. Why is that so funny?
I miss the smell of the oasis at dawn. This place has no scent.
Oh please, someone help.
Go and gloat somewhere else, outsider.
I don't know why the general ordered all this. We have far more than we need.
Prepare yourselves for war, friends! King Fahara'jad's army won't leave without a fight!
Let's see some blood!
This one can relate. Zithana still waits for word from Mathiisen. So much work for one trade deal.
Please, you have to believe me. The whole town has turned to stone!
See you later.
Someday maybe I will sail away on one of these ships.
These wounds from Colovian blades are brutal.
Some <<1>>!
Finally done? Good, plenty more to do!
May the Eight protect you, and our Mages Guild.
Brave meeting, adept! Give Shalidor my best, next time you see him.
Warm hearth here, eh adept?
Light off the portals, the light was so bright! Daedra has gone, has gone into night!
New moon rising ….
Annoying mage! Away with you!
Akatosh bless and keep you, adept.
Got it!
I like to bet big sometimes just to see the crowd's eyes get wider than dinner plates.
You'll regret this, outsider.
Maybe a lightning strike? What a way to go.
Get away from that, it's mine!
Somebody move this cargo for me!
I respect the radiance of Magnus, I simply wish it was not so fiercely upon me.
Please tell me you've made some headway with our 'Daedra concerns'.\n\nIt already pains me enough that I'm to manage the armory. Every guildmate that falls to them or fails to join the action is a knife in my eye.
Ozozzachar, my son! I summon you from the skies!
Everything is so … still.
What can I do for you, soldier?
Welcome back, warrior. The Dominion has need of you.
Armor! Don't go in harm's way without armor!
Not them!
How? How could we have failed so?
I'll share <<1>>'s gift. Make you respect my power!
Thank you! I can leave this nightmare!
Why must it be 'to the death'? I am confident, but… not that confident. Perhaps 'to the maim'?
You don't deserve to live.
The fury of Almalexia guides us!
I won't be defeated! I've come too far!
How much longer must we wait?
Spare some coin? Or some skooma?
That's what you get for denying my babies.
They abbey is reduced to rubble! What will we do now?
I think Countess Tamrith is doing a damn good job myself.
Here, you can get a view of majestic Elden Root in all its splendor.
The jungle port has suffered pests before, and will again.\n\nIt takes a clever mind to repel vermin—they do not see it coming.
Adusa has claws enough for all of you.
Lord Sotha would urge clemency toward his fellow scholars of Aetherius, given the destruction of their guildhall.\n\nAnd so, they shelter in our temple. Seekers of the Triune Way will simply have to cope with their neighbors.
I truck in magical goods. If that interests you, wonderful! Let's do business.\n\nIf not, then make room for anyone who is.
If the councilor has been hurt, we'll make Giron and the Maulborn pay!
Did you see the forest spirit?
Be careful with that!
You interested in buying a mount? Because I'm selling them. Assuming werewolves or something worse doesn't show up and make a meal out of them first, of course.
Can you feel it? With the Wood Orcs gone, it's like the forest is breathing a huge sigh of relief.
Well, you're tougher than you look.
The wave crashes.
I heard you and those mages ran headfirst into something evil in Elden Hollow. Good to see you live to delve again!
And the Undaunted returns! And from the Vaults of Madness themselves! Hope it was worth it—defeating the Mad Architect couldn't have been an easy feat.
I guess you fancy yourself the new ruler of Volenfell, now that you've conquered it. Too bad all your subjects are dead!
The main road! I said we should take the main road!
No flesh, no pain.
Mind your step.
When we are finished, peace will be upon you.
Raaawwwr!
Our Mistress has wounded this place forever.
Though all Mundus totters on the brink of Oblivion, we must not lose faith.\n\nNo matter what the Daedra do, we soldiers of the light must be ready to stop them.
This table is off limits. Taken. Reserved.\n\nThat means keep walking, pudding pie.
When you and your group are ready to enter the Arena, let me know.\n\nOnce you enter, however, there's no turning back.
Cities need wood and lots of it. Khaguur and I can hardly keep up!
Thank you for this shipment.
Did someone slay the Lady or is this a deceit?
Save some Daedra for me!
Halt!
I get tired of looking over supplies, lemme tell ya. But half these grunts can't count. So … yeah.
It's so hard to find decent servants these days!\n\nThe nerve of that woman! How could she leave when there's so much to be done?
We should have allied with the Worm Cult ages ago.
The city belongs to the Cult of the Black Worm, above and below.
The city reeks like a rotten wamasu.
Fear kills, much to my amusement.
How can we command the Daedroth when they are ignorant of our orders?
Come, mortals! The Devourer needs fresh meat!
The Harvesters make a lot of noise, but they fall short when it comes to cunning.
My spell has revealed the rifts! Destroy them!
Hmm. Why my uncle wrote all his recipes in Ayleidoon I'll never know.
Run, mortal!
If you make me chase you, I will hurt you!
The waters of justice flow downhill. Pay your fine or ... what were we talking about? Right, the bounty.
I knew this would happen!
All right. You can go now.
Uhm ... excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you to pay off your bounty .... Or else?
So, criminal, what appendage would you like me to remove? Or will you ruin my fun and pay your fine?
It was inevitable, really.
Wrong choice!
I hate to ask, but ... if it's all right with you, of course ... could you please pay your bounty?
Just my luck!
It's probably my fault.
You people never learn, do you?
Gall and pox, I hate this!
Your compliance is appreciated.
Is this how you choose to die?
Pay or die, criminal!
Don't be a horker. Just pay your bounty and be done with it.
I regret that I must go back to my patrol. Maybe later?
Golly, this is heavy.
You should have paid!
Smart. Next time, don't get caught.
When we draw weapons, everyone loses.
You are a credit to your alliance, wayfarer, and a friend to this city. I hope you will stay until the city has been reclaimed.
Stay away!
Hands off, thief!
You can't just walk in here.
Do you think I won't report that? Guard!
Could you stop doing that, please?
There's a thief among us.
What do you think you're doing?
I need help! Anyone!
You must be mad. Guards!
I'll … just be going.
Yes, of course. It's only right.
So you paid for your crimes? I suppose that means we can do business.
Please someone. Help!
I can't be seen dealing with the likes of you.
A crime has been committed.
Help, I require aid.
Get your hands away from me!
Please don't hurt me!
Murder--help!
There was no moisture in that, only a bounty.
By the Egg, I wish you would just leave.
Halt, at once.
Guards. There's a villain on the loose.
You make your own choices.
You are a cracked egg.
There are penalties for criminal behavior here.
I witnessed you stealing, and now I must call the guard.
You make your own choices.
Caution. A werewolf.
What brazenness.
The violence must stop!
If you continue, I will summon the guards.
What's done is done. Just don't try anything.
If you continue, I will summon the guards.
I cannot pause midstream to report a crime.
I'm watching you. Try anything and I'll call the guard.
I can't. If the guards saw, I'd be in trouble too.
Someone's gonna get hurt!
Oh, yes, my mistake. I'm so sorry.
You look like someone with better things to do.
No, no, no. Where'd it go?
Please don't hurt me. I never hurt a fig!
I don't think that belongs to you.
I can't abide pain, especially my own.
The gods rarely grant second chances. Do not waste this one.
Praise Hircine, my furry friend!
Typical. Not a guard around when you really need one.
That's a vampire. They do exist.
That's a gods' damned werewolf.
Think you can just kill someone and keep walking?
Wolf! Werewolf!
Fine. I'll catch you again anyway, no doubt.
I have a weapon and the skill to use it. Just so you know.
I didn't see anything! Just leave me out of it.
There's going to be trouble if you stay here.
It would be a grave mistake if I caught you again.
Someone break this up!
You wouldn't listen. Now you're in trouble.
He's going to kill me if I can't find it.
Stay away from my pockets.
Now where did I put that?
Ugh. This behavior sickens me.
If the guards ask, I saw nothing.
By the Eight! I'm getting out of here!
We have an empty spot in the stockade, so go on.
Divines, help me!
Normally I require a bribe to do this, but I'll do it for a favor this time.
That's a fetching werewolf.
Hold it, s'wit!
Look what the guar dragged in …. Plan on paying this time?
Look what the guar dragged in …. Plan on paying this time?
By the Three, leave me out of this!
Do I need to throw you out?
Stop this madness--now!
We've got nothing to discuss.
Murderer! You won't get away with it!
Someone stop that thief.
I'm fast. Very fast. Don't make me chase you.
I'm far too important to care what you do.
I'm not involved. Don't hurt me.
We can talk now that you've paid your bounty.
Tribunal protect me! I did nothing wrong!
Move along. This isn't a public place.
Call the guard. That thief is getting away.
When the Guard arrives, you'll be sorry.
Help! Please help!
You do not wish to cross the path of the law.
It's unnatural to change forms.
I have fangs too, vampire!
Back on the bright moon's path, yes? This one is glad to hear it. What can I get you?
Odd. My valuables have suddenly gone missing.
Get out now.
Ugh. Who cares.
This one needs assistance.
Leave now.
Wait right there.
I can see you, clawless one.
You won't get away with this, sneak-thief.
Do not try to steal from me.
Get out.
Someone stop that criminal.
Do I need to call a guard, you skeever?
Where in Oblivion did I put it?
You little sneak!
Having a good time over there?
I was robbed once. Just once.
I bid you, surrender.
All right, I believe you. Now scoot!
Guards, come quick!
The Guard has been summoned and should be here at any moment.
Hrmph. Amateur.
Kyne sees what you did.
Guards, help me!
I want nothing to do with this.
I could have sworn I brought that with me.
I need assistance.
Gone? Ugh … what a day.
Guards! I've just witnessed a serious crime.
Please, I'm not brave. I'm not a hero!
You'd better have a good explanation for your actions.
I'm ordering you to stop.
Code of Malacath: you steal, you pay the price.
What in the blazes do you think you're doing?
Fine. Just do your business and go.
Not my problem.
There's laws here. You break them, you pay.
You won't get my blood! Guard!
That's just wrong.
Lousy criminals. Always causing trouble for the rest of us.
There's a price on your head, lawbreaker.
You won't get away from me.
Now that I found you, I hate to let you go. Farewell, my sweet.
No need to worry about me.
Someone signal the guards.
You're free to go. For now.
That was uncalled for.
The last time I summoned the Guard, they arrived very quickly.
I could have sworn you were a criminal, but what do I know?
An attack! Guards!
Gore and glory, foul beast.
You'd better not be planning anything foolish.
Back to your coffin, vampire!
Careful or I'll cut that hand off.
You should be ashamed of what you have done.
Go away. I don't want the guards after me!
Please, I do not wish to die today.
You're about as subtle as a drunken mammoth.
You're not welcome here. Go away.
I fear I must ruin your day.
My, you've been busy! Let us do business, my friend.
Let's see what you've got. We'll do our best to get it back to its rightful owners.
Any chance you recovered something interesting on your latest adventure?
No time for chit-chat. What can I do for you?
I just can't stop wondering—when did it all start to fall apart?\n\nI've served on the Elder Council for years. I've seen Emperors come and go, but I took it for granted that the Imperial City would be safe, that the citizens would be safe ….
My, you put the rest of these so-called Enforcers to shame! Your bearing, that scrumptious grin playing across your lips … it makes me want to do something illegal just so you'll notice me.
I employ the latest alchemical and arcane techniques to solve crimes and capture my bounties.\n\nMy fellow Enforcers find my methods strange, but they can't argue with the results. I always get my prey.
No, I'm not taking any more jobs. Don't need to. Finally made enough coin to retire. It's nothing but the good life for me from here on out.
Don't mind me. I've been tracking bounties for three days straight. I almost had them a few times, but this group is tricky. So I came in here for a moment's rest. If I doze off, give me a poke, all right?
I used to be a respected scholar and historian. On one of my expeditions, I decided to keep a small, insignificant relic for myself. And what happened?\n\nThey called me a looter. A tomb raider! Now I have to rob tombs just to keep food on my table.
Up! Out of tunnels! Attack!
Why? My echalettes were innocent!
Watch your step, <<1>>! You know I'm not catching you if you fall, right?
I hate this place. Nothing but dry bread and old turnips to eat. I never should have gotten on that cart.
Ah, this food smells so good. If only I had some gold.
I must thank you again, my friend. Studying those relics will keep me busy for months!\n\nPerhaps we can work together again in the near future. Yes, I think I'd like that!
Now that's action!
I thought this was a combat arena! Hit 'em!
Go on! Fight!
It is time to feed, my pet!
The Xivkyn hunt mortals for sport. Do not underestimate their cruelty.
We'll head out soon, pup, I promise.
The tree! Protect the tree!
This land presents us with amazing opportunities.\n\nI just wish it wasn't so damn cold all the time.
Wrothgar is no place for unskilled riders. Keep yourself sharp.
The damn quarry workers and their jibes! Soul gems aren't that much different from graystone. Just lighter. And more purple.
Spill the blood of the innocent! Desecrate the stones!
Run and hide, prey!
Agag gor yarg!
Now I shall reveal my true power!
Wrong.
Wealth beyond measure, muthsera?
Be assured and rest easy - nothing here was pillaged from any ancient tomb!
This one does not accept barter of shed fur, whether damp or dry. Gold, only.
A dry bed and a hot bowl—that's what we offer at Skalar's Hostel. Nothing fancy, but we're clean and we're cheap.
Teifi travels with the Twilight Cantors. Most of the time, it is a joy. But not this time.
Nothing is lost in Abah's Landing, only finding another path.
Grr, this one does not like the cold and damp.
I don't care what you're worth. Now you die!
I'm so bored! Nothing ever happens at <<1>>.
I wonder if we'll get any cake. I love cake.
No more filthy mire, or filthy criminals, at last.
"The jaunt, the bounce, the swaying tail. Like a ship on four legs, pounding down the trail."\n\nThat's one of my favorite lines from the poems of Drusk the Would-Be Bard. It describes my favorite animal perfectly!
Let's split up. I'll meet you at <<c:1>>. The others need to hear what happened.
No, Initiate. First you finish the contract, then you speak to me.
If you're looking for a warm welcome, you've come to the wrong place. This castle's just a pirate's roost nowadays.
Sorry friend, we're between games. You wouldn't wanna play me anyway. Nobody plays Fool-Me Dice like Ginereth.
You would face me again? Foolish.
Fortunata did love her drink. I always said it would be the death of her.
You're mine! All mine!
Onward and inward.
Shaveskins laugh at this one's belly. Lucky for them, Sugar-Dance has plenty of self-confidence and a very calm demeanor.
Feh. These gray Orcs smell like a mammoth's armpit, but this red metal will fetch a fine price, yes?
Used to make my bread in Wayrest fighting anyone who'd fight back, until High King Emeric shut us down.
They said I could make a fortune here, now that slavery was abolished. I just never expected there to be so many Dark Elves all over the place!
Honor to you, sera. I'm certain I have something of interest to a seasoned traveler.
Do you think we can complete the ritual with a different item?
I say we go out and slaughter every Ashlander tribe in Vvardenfell.
Weather in this part of the world can be brutal when you don't have a roof over your head.
Are you someone famous? Perhaps I've heard of you. Well, in that case, let me show you my stock.
Now you I've heard of! I saved something special just for you!
Smuggling? Who said anything about smuggling? I run an honest transportation service. Above board and squeaky clean, that's our motto.
Ah! Another member of our ranks. It's times like these when I love the Fighters Guild!
This one is saddened to see a fine individual such as yourself without a home. Rest your eyes upon the wonders that could be yours. Oh, if only you had lodging. Well-kept, well furnished lodging.
A warrior has to prove themselves constantly in these parts. I have the best furniture around to prove you did just that.
Yes, um, well, yes, hello! Nice to, well, meet you. Um….\n\nHow can I best be helping you? Oh drat, I mean, help you! How can I best help you!
Stormlords are the fiercest competitors. They'll always win!
No! Baar Dau can't come down! Everything will be ruined!
Hurt it, hurt it!
If you want to get into Tel Aruhn, just go through the door. If you want something else, go bother someone else.
I don't know why I bother to make the trip to Tel Branora. Between the hazards of the swamps and the reclusive mages, it's almost not worth the trouble.
Don't tell my brother I'm here. He prides himself on his cooking, but he's made this resolution to not eat meat. I can't stand it.
Any day I don't have to go down in that pit is a good day.
Yes, yes, I've heard it before. You've never seen a bug as big as that one. Well, don't fret too much. She's never seen a s'wit like you, either.\n\nWhere do you want to go?
So, tell me, Dark Elf to Dark Elf, what do you think is happening in Vvardenfell? Have you ever seen Red Mountain so active? And what about the rumors coming out of Vivec City?\n\nSorry, you probably want to talk about silt striders. Ignore me.
Our foes shall be vanquished!
Victory is within reach!
They cannot stop us!
Protect the relic at all costs!
Protect that relic!
Protect the relic at all costs!
We got the relic!
The relic! They picked it up!
Snatch the relic, quickly!
Get that relic, or get off the field!
Snatch the relic, quickly!
Get that relic! Go, go!
By the brightest moons! We've captured the relic!
They have captured the relic!
Select the reward you wish to exchange.
Our spines droop today!
Baan Dar's fingers!
It's not going particularly well, is it.
Magrus scorch them!
Say farewell to victory.
The spectre of defeat looms.
We have seized the point!
They secured the point!
We have the ball!
We have the ball!
This can't be! We dropped the ball!
The ball has been dropped!
Pick up the ball, now!
They've dropped the ball! Rush those churlish fiends!
Have you seen the statue of Lord Seht in the square? Isn't it just so … gleaming? How glorious to be watched over by such a handsome god.
You don't look like you know a glyph from a rune, but I suppose I can't turn away every piece of scrap that enters my shop.
Why have an empty, dusty house when you can fill it with my goods? Come on, have a look!
To Orkey's wretched arse with you.
Shor's bones! More spirits! Cleanse those corpses before anymore draugr block our escape.
Soul gems are common power sources, but ultimately ineffectual for more ambitious designs.
How may I serve you today, Lord Sotha Sil? Do you need your clothes washed? Your hair washed? Any pets washed?
We can use that to our advantage. Kagrenac's machines will be useless once they lie at the bottom of the sea.
We made a pact. A vow. How could I have done this?
I can shield you! Hurry!
Lost within the Radius. High upon a cliff. Shining pink petals above. I think the Ventral Terminus is nearby?\n\nI'm sure I'll understand the symbolism once you return my integral of introspection.
Have I not been loyal? Have I not been faithful? How long must I be tested?
This ancient gate consists of seven thousand, eight hundred, and ninety-three individual bricks, three of which are loose.
Suffering is the will of the Three.
Unauthorized breach in storage compartment.
Damage critical. Shutting down.
Come on, come on! The point's moved!
On to the new point!
Come on, come on! The point's moved!
Tusk it! To the new point!
That new point won't capture itself!
<Disappointed whine.>
Your bones will break on my shield!
Use those freezing attacks to your advantage!
So much research yet to do. I'm so happy you're all here to help me!
You returned just in time! A new spate of abyssal geysers have appeared across the island. We need to act quickly upon the information Cainar and Miriya gathered.
The Oracle must be found!
Barra, traveler. While in Lillandril, why not make a purchase or two?
Do you think you're the first to hunt Vykosa? Her whole life, she has been running.
Reefhammer, destroy these fools!
I'm adding obscenity to the list of charges.
You'll find Belanaril most shocking!
My ship is ready to sail. Looking to go on a voyage?
Zandal hoped to find work on a ship. No one told him that the Divine Prosecution would be holding each ship in quarantine for several days.\n\nNo work for this one, then.
Every tradesman from here to Alinor looks at the decree and thinks they'll suddenly have an army of cheap labor. But everyone knows the quality of High Elf work! If our crafts are left to the work of ephems, our reputation will grow tarnished.
The only fish I've caught were sad things. I don't understand it. I've tried every cast, every kind of bait I know. I never had this much trouble in Abah's Landing!
With every crate moved, this one's bones ache more and more. Perhaps she grows too old for such work.
Here! This light will carve a path through the darkness!
Rip them apart, Falarielle!
My shadows are endless!
You shall feel my gryphon's might!
My furnishings are an excellent way to show off how your reputation has grown.
Vykosa calls for your death! And I obey.
You hero types always seem busy, rushing off to the next great adventure. Take time to celebrate your victories! Perhaps with some new furniture, ja?
Frozen in awe before our might? I can hardly blame you.
Cyrodilic Collections could use your help again, my friend!
Ha! Famia hasn't gotten you killed yet? Well, in that case, let me have a go at it. Got a lead on a job that's right up your alley.
Let us show them what the Blackguards are made of!
I shake my head and deliver sad news. This shop is closed. The owner has gone hunting. I am just keeping an eye on her stock.
You sniveling snake. That's my coin purse and you know it!
Words have always been, "Blood sprayed across their snout, and their nostrils filled with the scent of despair!" Yet you speak of rubies and courage?
Whose turn was it to cook? This nalduku tastes like … well, nalduku!
Watch your step, ojel. As this place returns to the swamp, it becomes just as dangerous to the unwary.
The Argonians here are just so droll. Insult one today, and they'll have forgotten by tomorrow. They're so … bestial in that way, don't you think?
Weep as I do!
Looking for work, walker? There is more than enough to go around.
Plant the seed in the source!
Do you think you have me cornered?
So you've returned. Has your assignment been completed?
If you're looking to travel south, I have one word of warning; don't. There's nothing down there but thieves and cutthroats. \n\nBest to stay up north where it's safe. Well, safer at least.
I finally have the chance to study Dragons, some of the most powerful, most elusive creatures that Tamriel has to offer.\n\nAnd where do they decide to appear? In Elsweyr, of all places.
Ah, another beautiful day in Queen Euraxia's Rimmen!\n\nTamruz grows so tired of his compatriots' yowling. Rule by Imperial conqueror is a glorious thing, walker. A glorious, lucrative thing!
The Khajiit here have been just so kind! I've had several invite me to dinner with them, and several more offering gifts of welcome.\n\nWho knew that Elsweyr would be so welcoming to travelers?
Lanasi cannot help tend the fields, due to her size. So instead she balances books and helps the farmers with their finances.\n\nShe does also tend to catch the occasional mouse, but that is just between us, yes?
The Khajiit and Wood Elves have never gotten along.\n\nI mean, yes, we're in the same alliance now. But that means we just hate each other a little more quietly than usual.
You cannot deny Alkosh forever.
Oh, hello. Have you heard? A Baandari caravan came through and said Dragons were spotted in the Khajiiti homeland.
Think you can weather the storm?
You presume to enter our sacred grounds? Blasphemer!
Keep your hands off what's mine!
Blind rage will not eliminate these vermin. Focus.
Fehdni hears distressing rumors about what happened in Baan Dar's Litter. All those people abandoned ….\n\nThis one has much praying to do.
Bow before the Dragon King of Cats!
Away with you and your unclean magic!
Really? How dare you use that detestable magic?
Stay back, necromancer. I do not make idle threats.
Justice-ArgM/B/Necro
I hear the beating of great wings. Run!
Justice-BreF/D/Necro
Oh, that's not good. Take your foul magic elsewhere!
Lord Vivec, deliver us!
Haven't we got enough problems without you provoking the dead?
Justice-KhaM/D/Necro
Watch out! We've got a nasty one here.
Help! There's a beast about!
You leave the dead be, necromancer!
To arms, to arms! A Dragon approaches!
To raise the dead is blasphemy, you cur!
Tava, give me speed! A Dragon approaches!
Press your advantage!
Well, hello! I saw you across the marketplace and was sure you'd come to survey my wares.\n\nI sell useful things.
Ah Senchal, home of the easy score. Weather is nice too, so long as you do not mind the scent of smoke and blood in the air.\n\nAnyway, let's do business.
Some days, this one thinks we might fully restore Senchal. Other days, this one sees weeds and vines take over another building.
You look tasty, and it's time for my next snack.\n\nI kid, of course. It's not nice to hunt prey in the city.
I thought I saw a Dragon fly over Senchal. I screamed and ran. Turns out, it was just a bird. A bird! \n\nIt was a big bird, I'll have you know!
Oh, you'll make fertile ground!
Well, go on. We both got things to be doing.
Heard there's a hurricane bearing down on us. Make sure everything's tied down, eh?
One need only walk about this city to find artistic inspiration. The ruins, the castle, the bustling marketplace. Almira finds beauty even in ruin.
Lost one. We can spare you these deprivations.
The storm's rage is endless!
This one is always open for business!
This one only drinks from the shrine fonts. You should too.
Why must we wait? Our moment of glory is at hand!
Hazazhur tries to keep in good spirits, for his sweet Tebabi. She does not fare well, you see, and we have lost so much.
You may not have a house, but I still have furniture to peruse. Perhaps you can help spruce up the sanctum.
Enough appetizers. Time for the main course!
Ha! You have no idea what you're up against.
Did I overbid that last auction? Ah, well.
They'll never take this island away from us. Never.
Bones, bones … it's like a damned kennel in here.
Intruders? Intruders!
A part of me wonders if I chose the right vocation. I enjoy crafting with leather, but it's such a change after years of sailing. On the sea, you know your crew has your back. On land, things feel much more complicated.
By all the gods anywhere, what did I do to deserve such a preening, shame-ridden, blame-throwing … gah! Can you believe the man I serve day in and day out just accused me of stealing his pastry? Right after he ate it?\n\nCame here to calm down.
I can't tell anyone here, but I'm burning up inside. Thaezara is like lightning—exciting, invigorating. Viatrix was like porridge—comforting, but plain.\n\nWhat have I gotten myself into? Oh, forget I said anything.
Have you read the latest mystery story by Yvonna Graymoth? If not, you should! You'll never guess who the killer is! I didn't.
Have you ever followed an insect for awhile? Just to see where it goes and what it does? I do that at least once a day.\n\nThese creatures are fascinating! Especially bees. Bees are magical creatures.
The bridge is just the start.
I have more than bloodknights to deal with you.
Protect your favorite weapons by storing them with us!\n\nBut please, no fish. I can't stomach the smell.
You need more hiding spots for your belongings, don't you? All my bags and packs have secret places to thwart nimble fingers.
I'm supposed to be far away from here, yet I'm not. Instead, I sell things so that I might one day leave this place. Please consider buying something?
While you're browsing my goods, think about this: adding an eighth dog to my pack of seven.\n\nWondrous idea, isn't it?
Some fellow dropped off a book detailing smithing techniques that were used by Dwarves in that one ruin. I'd say it, but the tongue. It tangles.
Watch the cats. They're always looking for more fish to eat. If you have some, they'll know. Just like I know I can help you with some fishy goods.
Wouldn't be wise for us to talk.
Off with you, creature!
Gah! What are you? Guards!
It'd be bad form if I were seen talking to you.
You'll leave this place, or you'll taste my steel!
You spit on our laws, I spit on you. Go away!
You'd think that people around here would welcome me!\n\nWith all the hardship they've faced, why wouldn't they show their faith to the gods and ask for some peace?
Don't spill any of that new netherroot brew. Nearly passed out from the fumes.
My hands blister any worse, I won't be able to use them.
I don't like the harrowed blood. It's bland.
I pity those who won't experience the glory of a harrowstorm.
They smear something on those pikes before the ritual. Makes me glad I don't need to breathe.
Kyne bless you, stranger!
Imagine, they almost killed us!
Rise, rise, rise!
We don't have any more work for you today. Come back soon.
I look forward to our final march on Skyrim.
Does it ever feel like the gargoyles are watching you?
People say you should never mix hard liquor and beer, but—hrng, ugh—it's wine and fur that are real trouble. Ulp ….\n\nWhich way to the little Khajiit's room?
My clan, the Deathwings, reveres the cycle of life and death. \n\nDeath informs every piece of art I create.
In all her years, Adusa-daro has never faced an enemy like the Gray Host. This one never expected an ancient army of vampires and werewolves to return from the dead!
First time I met Ard Caddach, I got so nervous I dropped my blade. Some impression I made, eh?
The effort put into digging these tunnels. The Dark Heart was clearly vital to the Nighthollow clan's power.
I heard a vateshran's tale that said our ancestors lived in the Reach when the world was young. It's in our very blood to defend it.\n\nReturn later if you seek to aid us.
Everything was going according to plan. And then ….
The Reach rebels. This is all their fault.
Let the mortals tremble in our wake!
[low intimidating growl]
Now can you see how far beneath me you are?
Bring them to me!
I'll look for some more of that oil.
So, just to be clear, I'm a former member of the Order of the Waking Flame. You'd call it a Daedric cult, I suppose, but while we're in the movement, we never use the "c" word.\n\nNow that I'm out, I can say it with impunity—cult, cult, cult!
Almost. My cold fire must reach an active power module to disable it.
We only employ those who know what they're doing in a fight. Do you think you have what it takes?\n\nThere's a fine reward waiting in the coffers of the Chamber of Legates if you do.
Got him right where I want him!
This is for my brother!
You're planning to eat that, right?
I waited for eternity. I can do so for longer.
Can I help you with something?
That was a hassle. Damn monsters took me by surprise. Thank you for taking care of them.
Lord Dagon's reign shall never end.
Stibbo follow!
Show me your blood, mortal.
We must be getting close. The spirit approaches.
Should we kill them quickly, or do we have time to play?
We live to serve.
The Kyn taste bitter. Where are the mortals? I want something sweet.
For Mephala!
Can you imagine the power we'll wield once we have the relic?
I was hoping to try out this truth serum, but the High Elf spilled everything without a fuss.
Blackwood's servant-class is the worst. They natter on endlessly when I ask them questions, so I must constantly interrupt them to keep them on task!\n\nHonestly, the world would be so much better if people just did what they were told.
What do you suppose Councilor Vandacia is going to do with the prisoner?
You will not escape this place.
The rest shall fall after you!
Some of the noble class here in Leyawiin lack even basic empathy. They are so concerned with their grand feasts and lavish displays of wealth, they forget to show kindness to others.
The secret to my success as a soldier? I keep my gear in order and I train every day.\n\nIf you don't do either of those things, I can assure you that you won't last long enough to set foot in Cyrodiil.
Archery? Eh, just a hobby. I'm a potter by trade.\n\nMost of the time, there's more money in clay than there is in blood. All that business in Cyrodiil, though? Who knows. Maybe I should make a career change after all.
Sometimes you need to hide out in a nice, safe place.\n\nAnd sometimes you need to hide out here.
Best if I keep my thoughts to myself right now. I don't want to argue.
There's no hiding from the eye of the inevitable.
Rocks. Stone. Molten rivers. No difference.
I have a gift for you. A keepsake.
I wonder where the rest of the family is right now. We're a bit of a far flung brood. Hopefully they're in good company.
I hope this is a good talk.
Since when have you cared what I think? Seems like you're just going to do what you like anyway, so why bother talking about it.\n\nLet's just get back to work and at least make this arrangement profitable.
I trust you. I don't trust many people outside of my immediate family. I hope you'll stick with me, through thick and thin.
Now here's a place I can really get some study done. Or killed. Either really.
Lady Laurent can be demanding, but she's a good mistress. In fact, she relies upon me for so many things. Cooking, cleaning, taking notes, handling travel arrangements, carefully investigating cursed objects. The latter? More often than you'd expect.
I am reborn! A force that will sunder this world! Bow down and you may yet be spared!
Stand your ground! The storm is coming!
My apologies.
Do you need something?
You're new.
Are you here to help me?
Drown in their fear!
Kill!
Feel that?
You came back? I'm impressed. Or, I will be if you actually did it. So tell me, adventurer, is it finished?
The Saraathu Tong isn't giving out any contracts right now. Sate your blood-lust somewhere else while you still can.
I know your face. Have you bought something from me? Or did I know you when I was corporeal?\n\nNo, that's not it. You're going to buy something soon. A washtub blueprint. I think.
Lady Laurent can be demanding, but she's a good mistress. In fact, she relies upon me for so many things. Cooking, cleaning, taking notes, handling travel arrangements, carefully investigating cursed objects. The latter? More often than you'd expect.
Your service to the Court is the stuff of legends! One day they will speak my name with such reverence. Squire Caw, the cat-slayer! Squire Caw, the hoard plunderer! Squire Caw, champion of quill and talon! Ha!\n\nCorn-farmers take heed. I am coming!
That Peddler of Prizes! Says I should give up my dream of knighthood and commit to real crow-work. Says I should hoard carrion, hide silver, and harass stray cats. But no. No! I am called to a higher purpose!\n\nVillainous dogs and vile rats, beware!
I'm getting out of here, you should too.
Come, you servants of Mehrunes Dagon! Fight!
Tougher than you. Tougher than everyone.
Have I shown you my mortal bone collection?
Why anything needs that many swords, I'll never know.
The Waking Flame are insane! They'll destroy us all!
Strike now!
Hurry it up. If I wanted my time and attention taken up by idiots, I wouldn't put myself behind these bars.
Destroy the mortal!
Enough of this. Proper authorities will deal with you.
Halt, mortal!
You should disguise your scent if you wish to sneak about.
My vision may be gone but I see you heathens clearly!
Please stay healthy.
Our enemies can't reach us here.
Is Mehrunes Dagon displeased?
You're blocking my view.
I do believe that this is empty. Wait. Now it is.
Mmm. This is delicious!
That strange High Elf over there is talking to fungi.
Zzavfa! I needed to sell that a while ago.
I haven't got all day.
Seems like everyone asks after Yuhleena's scars, but then they don't want to hear the stories.
Set your eyes to your next target.
Let us build a monument to Mehrunes Dagon with mortal bones.
We're running out of Daedra again.
That Dremora just looked at me funny.
I'm not supposed to talk about this, but I'm so excited! I just completed my studies and I've been promoted to relic-apprentice for the Ritemaster of the Psijic Order!\n\nI just had to share the news, but don't tell anyone, all right?
Back off, stranger. I'd appreciate it if you'd let me be.
They asked the famous Chef Donolon to cater this event, but he turned them down. I was the second pick. Can you believe the nerve? I make a better cake than that hack.
Rocky no! Don't do this!
I'm tired of waiting here.
The Ascendant Order gave me everything.
Surely you didn't mean to do that.
I'll be taking that gold—off your corpse!
Hello again. The Systres have need of you, if you have the time.
Great seeing you! Say, thanks again for helping me settle that business with Tu'heiba back in Elsweyr. Can you believe we're like best friends now? All right, not best friends, but steady allies. \n\nWell, more like frequent business acquaintances.
Sirens! A dirge for these doomed souls!
Dreadsails! Your queen demands a sacrifice!
Impressive.
Death to enemies of the spire!
<Jester Anglidor stares silently as he traces the shape of an invisible wall.>
The old hierarchy is dying. It's up to us to replace it with something better.
I could be the next Dreadsail Fleet Queen. Wipe that smirk off your face!
Y'ffre's power is stirring. The earth is angry.
I love the smell of the sea.
I supplied warships all around Sentinel before coming to the Systres. A little combat won't rattle me.
It doesn't seem like the Hadolids made homes here yet. Maybe they'll be more likely to leave.
You look busy enough. Just keep your eyes on the skies and the land—both are dangerous to those not paying full attention to their surroundings.
Woodworking. It may not be as glamorous as being a knight or a sailor, but it pays the bills. And I rarely have to worry about someone swinging a sword at me or drowning, so there is that.
This one had the distinct displeasure of running into a filthy peasant the other night in this very area. The poor thing groveled for my coin, even asked for my jewelry! The brashness. This one was almost impressed.
I cannot be bribed for my lady's secrets. My loyalty lies with the greatest mind in Gonfalon Bay.
The Debonaire was such a beautiful ship. I was such a beautiful captain ….
Hey, stay with me!
You're every street kid's dream, you know that? If you're offering lessons, I'm first in line!
I grew up on the streets. To me, stealing, lying, sneaking about, and violence are all necessary aspects of survival. It doesn't have to be a moral thing.
More coin in your pockets is always better than a fancy trinket.
It's wearing a little hat! That's adorable. Can I teach it a spell or two?
Ready to ride.
I'm in your service.
Back to Oblivion with you!
Hahaha. Can we do this every day?
That shaking underfoot? Ignore it. Focus on winning.\n\nThat's all that matters if you're a Storm Lord.
Thank you, Tall Papa!
You can't delay the inevitable.
You got lucky. Go on, then.
Ha! I knew I would win!
This one may take a nap while he waits ….
You did your best. Now, loser buys the winner a drink, eh?
Remain vigilant. The Order expects no less of us.
You're lucky I'm still open, traveler. No one's delivering anything now with all these tremors and eruptions. If the mountain doesn't settle soon, I don't know what we're going to do.\n\nStock up while you can.
No, no, her name was Maren. Wasn't it? Hmm.
Hmm, where did I put that again?
Ugh, my head.
You approach a lot of people who look like they don't want to be approached? How's that usually work out for you?
The archdruid really said this is all right?
I should be with the archdruid, not back here with you all.
Oh, you want a challenge then.
This one wishes he saw more hope in the eyes of the patients.
No. No!
I'm still not so sure about eating weevils … that has to be a joke.
My friends haven't written in awhile. I wonder how they're doing.
I deserve better than this work. I was born to be a knight. Feh.
Ah, the sunsets around High Isle and Amenos are glorious!
If the text isn't in the temple library, then where? The palace? Castle Navire?
I know you want to help Savage Systres Tours get up and running, but sadly I don't have any work for you right now.\n\nPlease come back soon, though!
Those useless Stonelore don't clean under everything.
Ow. Ouch. My hands. Hot. Hot. Hot.
Drown the unworthy!
Know, O wayfarer, that this humble carpenter will not forget the aid you offered in these troubled times.\n\nPeace be upon you.
You'll need a tightly sealed bag to keep your items safe from sea water. We even have some waterproof bags made with oiled leather if you have the coin.
I already have a stack of orders for funeral attire now that word of the Count's death has spread. Seems sad to think of fashion so soon, but we all have our ways of coping.
The Count is dead? I just placed an order for commemorative busts. I wonder if I can have them altered to look like Stefan. Hmm.
Fire-bird, destroy my foes!
I just love that scowl of yours.
We will make short work of you!
You shall perish in fire!
Abandon ship while you can!
Find the captain! Slay her!
Y'ffelon's volcano spits and spews with unbridled rage, the time is drawing near.
Practice? You should know what you're doing at my age.
Pacrooti welcomes you! So much of his business is carried out through couriers, it is nice to finally place names with faces!
Wind keeps blowing smoke in my face.
If you're looking for skilled crafters, you'd be hard pressed to find better than those here in Vastyr. Though I admit I'm somewhat biased.
Tu'whacca guide you, stranger. Vastyr is a place that welcomes many. Oh, it bursts with life. Everywhere you look, there's something new to explore.
Walk these lands long enough, and you see just about everything. Well, not everything. But more than you would expect.\n\nNow, how may I help you?
Curse this fog! Where are they?
The Firesong attack! Hurl them into the sea!
The smell! I need to get this off me!
You haven't defeated me yet!
Be careful!
Do not resist, my love. Hear my voice ….
This is the best place to handle all my tree-chopping needs.
Nothing ventured, nothing attained.
Adventure is for others, like yourself. I am content with my lot.
You came from far away, didn't you? I can see it in your eyes.
Thanks again for the assistance, my friend.
We need more hands to clear the burned houses away.
It's ready!
What is your quest?
I think I saw a rare scroll!
I'm not sure sealing off the city would help us fight a plague.
They can't lock us up like this!
You win, I'm out of here!
Broken? Not everything Ayleid has magicka!
I can't leave without it.
More drinks all around!
Have you tried the Isquelian Brandy? Such a robust taste this year.
By the Eight!
There are some rough characters on the docks, so watch your step.
Eyes forward soldier! Don't be eyeballing me!
My friend died at Lost Prospect. Thank you for putting an end to it.
Aren't you the one who saved Fallowstone?
Chicken, barkeep! Right now!
I'll cut you down where you stand!
Authorized only.
I … I have to get out of here. Get somewhere safe.
Now you die!
One of my neighbors got dragged off to work in the mines. Haven't seen her since.
High Kinlady Estre has been exposed as the Veiled Queen! All shun the murderer, the usurper!
I hate that damn dog!
She won't stop looking at me!
Get them while they're hot! New weapons and armor for you. Ask Ladrelas about his private fittings!
… your enemy falls!
Let me know if you hear anything. I don't want to be taken by surprise again.
Bright Moons hang above Eyevea, adept. All thanks to you.
Safe travels to you.
The mage Pircalmo betrayed us! He's a monster!
Bright Moons! This one hears the Colovians lost a powerful relic in fighting to the west.
Lay down your weapons. You have no need for them!
Almost. We still have to finish some minor preparations.
Go away, bird-lady!
Worms, crickets, even cheese - nothing!
Despite the culture shock of injecting the Dominion into Woodhearth, things are going well here.\n\nMore room for research would be welcome, but with the Green Pact we must be cautious.\n\nNow, tell me what the Mages Guild can do for you.
We're clearing the trash out, yet. You know, rounding up the bodies and cleaning up the messes.\n\nDon't worry. We got it from here.
Submit, and become mine! Fight, and be destroyed!
Leave this place! You are not welcome!
Ah, the five-claws who conquers those who conquer Haven. If Bad Swimmer can be of any assistance to you, he will do so, happily.
Is it true you saw the Wilderking?
The hero who defeated the lich prince! The Dominion is truly in your debt!
My pack serves me, even in death!
None can stand against the might of the goddess!
Emerge the victor, and my knowledge is yours.
You want more lightning? I have plenty to go around!
Do you think he's considered the Green Pact? Or, really, do you think he knows anything about us?\n\nCould he really have come out here to explore our culture with no idea what we're like whatsoever?
During the Blacksap rebellion, this bridge was demolished by Colovian mercenaries marching to join <<1>> at <<2>>. The magic granted us by the Green Pact has since regrown it, but you can still smell the ash.
Have you found the tome?
Shornhelm is an old city, we've withstood plagues, wars and other disasters.
Do Wood Orcs fear horses? I couldn't stop them from whinnying while we hid.\n\nThat would be ridiculous. Wood Orcs, afraid of horses? Hmph.
Still nothing. Damn.
I want no trouble.
May the light keep you in its warm and soothing embrace.
Don't be timid!
<Straining grunt.>
It is so cold here, yet M'aiq sees Nords in sandals. Madness!
Please—help me!
I will drive Men and Mer from Nirn.
As long as no one hits me in the face, I'll be fine. I hate it when people hit me in the face.
We've got all kinds of goods for sale! Only … slightly used.
Break them! Break the mortals!
Forgive me for this meager stock. Wrothgar does not surrender her reagents easily.
I want that buried—now!
Do the Winterborn have any magic that isn't just vile and disgusting?
You'll need equipment. Just so happens I have some I could sell you.
If you won't run, then perish!
Feed on their corpses. Yours is growing flesh.
Empower me, minions!
There you are. History is once again threatened in the Elven Gardens, my friend. \n\nThe Xivkyn have returned with a fiery vengeance.
I think I need some time alone. Forgive me.
While I appreciate the supplies you delivered from General Pollius, I'd like it even better if he did something about all the horrible Daedra wandering around, eating people.
This city will be raised from the dead!
The city is ours. At this point, who can stand against us?
We heard there were piles of gold down here. Almost nothing so far but hordes of Daedra and strange bandits. I think we were duped.
Crime? I have no idea what you mean.
A pleasure clearing your record.
I am drawn by your musk, but also by my duty. Please. Do not make me scar such a pretty face.
Just a minute. Your crimes are known here, and I would see your bounty collected.
I've fought better than you!
This money's filthy.
Yes, I know. I make this uniform look good. Now stop staring and pay me your bounty.
I knew I should've brought my other weapon!
You've been caught committing crimes against society. You will pay the bounty.
This one likes dealing with the lawless types. Pay your bounty and then we can discuss your punishment, yes?
You paid your bounty? Well done!
Was I not clear? Surrender!
Go and break no laws. You're free.
You have been accused of a crime and I am authorized to demand you pay bounty.
Don't tell me your story. I don't want to hear it. I just want to collect your bounty.
You dumb or something? Only dumb folks do crime. Now pay up!
Your record is clear. For now.
Stay still and let me hit you!
I'd hoped we could come to a different arrangement!
I look forward to collecting from you again!
I will defeat you, lawbreaker!
Cease and desist!
Oh, look. A criminal genius. I'd be impressed, but you look so … ordinary. Now pay your bounty.
The blood of the Daedra is foul, and they can return for revenge.
These Dremora are naught but a poor imitation of Lord Dagon's servants. We are Molag Bal's true children.
Hey! Lay off, thief!
Make yourself scarce. I'm calling the Guard.
You're a murderer!
Criminality will not be tolerated.
The guards are looking for you.
Please, I want no trouble.
Stop--I mean, it's all right. Just don't hurt me.
There's a vampire among us!
I'm afraid you're going to have to leave.
Anything for you.
You're over your limit for warnings. Leave.
Guards? Anyone? Help me!
Leave me be.
Look at those teeth!
You disgust me, criminal.
Preserve me from this danger.
The criminal you are looking for is over here.
Not leaving? Fine. It's your bounty.
Stars protect us. It's a vampire.
Don't expect me to care.
You must clear your name with the guards first.
As surely as the river flows, you will pay for your crime.
Someone--kill it!
Guard! There's a thief on the loose.
Commit a crime and you'll regret it.
I've had enough of these criminals.
The peaceful pond harms no one.
Pickpocketing is a crime!
Isn't there something better you could be doing?
I don't want trouble.
I am not getting involved in this mess.
All right, but don't try my patience again.
Please, let me go.
Limp spines! You can't do that!
Criminals!
This is none of my concern.
Please stop the violence.
You're a bit heavy-handed for that.
Limp spines! You can't do that!
If I'm going to be robbed, I'd prefer it was by a professional.
Don't look at me. I won't say a word.
That's mine, you bastard.
A little help here?
Lorkhan take you, lawbreaker!
What? Where'd you come from?
Somehow, I see this getting ugly.
Sorry friend, you got caught this time.
That's mine, you bastard.
Lorkhan take you, lawbreaker!
I'm the law. I don't look the other way.
Help, there's a murderer on the loose.
Dibella's Buttocks! What are you thinking?
Murder! Murder, I say!
I'd run if I were you!
Please just go. I'll keep quiet.
You're in trouble now. Should've left while you had the chance.
Oh, how ghastly!
Look at those fangs!
This doesn't need to get any worse. Just leave.
You go right ahead. Don't mind me.
Just don't tell the captain.
Someone stop that crooked fiend!
Fetch the silver--it's a werewolf!
What do you think you're doing?
Back! Back, you villain!
Curious. It was just here.
That's quite enough of that!
I saw what you did there. You disgust me!
There is no excuse for murder.
I just live here, all right?
Go on. If you're going to break the law, go right ahead.
Don't mind me.
You're as subtle as a bull netch in a pottery shop.
My blood is my own, monster.
I think that s'wit over there is a wanted criminal.
I never remember anything, just ask my mate.
Leave me out of it.
My lips are sealed.
I think that s'wit over there is a wanted criminal.
There's a thief on the loose!
Disgraceful!
Calm the guards. We can talk after.
You could have walked out. Now the guards will haul you away.
A wolf--kill it!
Not until you've paid your bounty, fetcher.
I wonder if I left that back at the tavern?
Since you won't leave, I've summoned the Guard.
Since you won't leave, I've summoned the Guard.
You should be ashamed!
Dark moons, I've heard the bounty on that one is high.
This one likes you, so you can go with a warning.
Don't touch!
The law is always watching you, walker.
The guard is looking for you.
I guess I'll have to buy another one.
Sheathe your claws!
How brave of you, and with me watching. You must have mead in your blood.
I appreciate the explanation. Move along.
The Guard is on its way, intruder.
There's been an assault! Guards!
A werewolf? Ooo, I'm frightened.
Hey! You aren't welcome here.
That's it. You can explain yourself to the Guard.
I like a criminal with a large bounty.
I'm sure this is just an honest mistake.
Kyne protect us!
Are you trying to pick my pocket?
I knew you weren't going to be worth my time. Go away.
No loitering.
Kyne protect us!
Shor's bones, a werewolf!
Damn it, help!
Run. I won't stop you.
You can't steal here. You'll have to pay.
I don't deal with criminals.
You chose to deal with the guard, thief.
I saw that, you dumb son-of-a-troll.
Touch me and die. I have nothing to do with this.
Why would anyone do such a thing?
By Mauloch, there's been a murder!
Hey! Come back here, thief!
Looking for trouble, eh?
Mauloch take you and leave me be.
I thought the idea was not to attract attention.
Why do I always get the accidental criminals? Get lost.
Stay back, scum!
Since when do strangers just barge in here?
This seems a little light.
Anyone! Please!
That is not permitted here!
Get away from me, you miserable thief.
Don't hurt me. I won't tell anyone.
He who harms one, harms himself.
Get out of here, monster!
Are you mad? Get out of here.
This is not my concern.
Tava grant me speed.
Are you ill? Why do you hunch so?
You will eat sand for this.
Your cooperation is appreciated. You may go.
I pray that's the last life you take.
You murderous dog!
Away, you slavering beast!
Step right up, Enforcer. You know how this works.
Gold? Oh yes, you mean for recovered goods. My pleasure.
I am the righteous arm of Almsivi. Pay the bounty or suffer the wrath of the Three.
Any minute now, those chains up there are going to drag this whole city into Coldharbour. Might as well get used to it. Molag Bal is in charge now.
You look like a seasoned Enforcer. I'd love to shadow you one day, so you could show me the ropes.\n\nYou are an Enforcer, right? Keeping track of the latest garb is so confusing.
Deep down, everyone's dirty. Some of us just look clean.
Have you seen a beautiful but dangerous-looking Dark Elf around here? Goes by the name of Naryu?\n\nShe told me she was going to meet me down here, but I think she stood me up. Again.
Sometimes I use wigs and costumes, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to change your appearance just by shifting your stance or tilting your head.\n\nDid you see what I did there? I bet for a moment, you thought you were talking to somebody else!
<The creature mutters unintelligibly beneath its breath. It sniffs the air, then snorts.>
We didn't think anyone could be so gullible, but you proved us wrong!
Kurog, no! I will sacrifice my life so that you may live!
That hit the mark!
Let us see how you … ah, yes!
I like taverns. Some of my best memories were made in places just like this. I wonder if anyone plans to start a good, old-fashioned brawl?\n\nI suppose that with all the Orcs around, chances are pretty good. I can't wait!
These Morkul Orcs are pleasant enough … as Orcs go, I mean. Just don't speak ill of their forge. I'd hate to lose another customer.
Better loosen those purse strings, stranger. Arcane goods don't come cheap out here.
Nothing happened. If you must guess, at least try to guess correctly.
This one does not accept barter of holy objects or work in kind. Gold, only.
In all of your time adventuring, what is the size of your hoard? Unburden and unpack! Give me your money!
Pick your poison! Er, I don't sell actual poison. It's an expression.
It'd just go easier if he'd 'fess up.
Feel free to use the workshop. Just stay away from the grain baskets. If I catch you stealing any of my crop, I'll feed you to the next dire wolf pack that wanders by.
Eyes open, this one's used to going unnoticed.
Rumor has it that the Order of the Hour will soon patrol the streets of Anvil with the same impunity they show in Kvatch.\n\nI can't see the Provincial Governor allowing that to happen, but what do I know of politics?
This is the alchemy shop. If you're looking for the tavern, that's the building up the street with the drunks stumbling out of it.
May I be of service?
Ha! Now you feed the worms and lizards!
Can't you see I'm busy?
I know I usually make jokes, but I wanted to say thanks. You killed the Black Dragon. You sent Artorius to the Void. And you accomplished all that without a modicum of my grace or social skills.\n\nWell done, Silencer. Well done.
Priests and pirates don't mix. You remember that, mate.
This chapel is a disgrace! I haven't had a naked priest squeeze my bottom in decades! And the bosoms? Don't even get me started on the bosoms!\n\nNo wonder Dibella's turned her back on us!
The end of the world is unavoidable. Chaos is inevitable. The Serpent wills it so.
Victory! Three cheers for the survivors! They get to live another day!
Another go-around, my friend?
Who wrote this logistics report? It's covered in … is that dried honey?
Ah, how I've missed this land! My duties within the Mages Guild send me far and wide, so I cherish the time I get to spend in Vvardenfell.
I am a free egg-sister from Black Marsh, here to make a business and prosper.\n\nNo one told me that business was going to be so difficult, though.
Welcome to my humble shop, sera. Just let me know if you'd like to make a purchase.
Why would our Daedric Prince allow this to happen?
Ashlanders! The Tribunal should have wiped them out ages ago!
One crate there. Select it, my friend.
Got something for me?
Seryn, the outlander's lies have no place in this debate.
My passengers don't need to worry about a thing. Not a thing. We take care of everything. And in the most delicate manner possible. Now, would you like to join us?
The Fighters Guild is always ready for battle. It's what we live for!
Greetings, Hlaalu!
News travels fast in these parts. It says that my furniture is the best around. Take a look and see for yourself.
How can this be happening? This glorious city can't be destroyed!
You take. You take.
Has anyone fed that thing lately?
Besieged by garbage. A new low.
Red Mountain erupting caused major setbacks. Between the lost workers and the damaged stone, it will be years before everything is done.
What kind of example do I set? Lolling about this canton. I've read every book in the place and paced every corridor a hundred times. It's not what the Warrior-Poet would do.
I've come here for fine food and quality entertainment. You, my friend, provide me with neither.
There's much preparation to do for a silt strider journey, but we're just about ready to leave. \n\nWould you care to join us?
We shall scorch the very sky!
Jone and Jode smile upon us!
Almost there!
I'm glad you're on our side!
You honor Onsi with your prowess!
The glory is yours! You earned it!
They took the relic!
Snatch the relic back, quickly!
No, no! We dropped the relic!
We must get the relic!
Kyne's glory! They've dropped the relic!
Stendarr guides us! We've taken the relic!
Glory of Almalexia! We've taken the relic!
They have captured the relic!
They have secured the relic!
They captured the relic!
Baan Dar's fingers!
Our moons grow darker!
Eat sand, damn you!
Do you want to lose?! Come on!
Don't give up now! Get back in the fight!
The point is ours!
Protect that ball!
Guard that ball with your life!
Don't drop that ball!
They picked up the ball!
They've got the ball! Malacath take them!
Snatch the ball, quick!
We have dropped the ball! Kyne mocks us!
Somebody grab the ball!
Get that ball! Go, go!
I have many functions to help you with your purchases.
Look, I sell your typical packs. They aren't enchanted to be feather light or indestructible. They're just packs.
You have a house to fill. I have furniture to sell. Do you see where I'm going with this?
I'm the best fence in all of Clockwork! Ask anyone. Well, don't ask Rullordril, he probably has a different opinion.
The ancestors crave your blood!
What are you waiting for, coward?
No one can save this hold now!
Earth and fire obey!
The forgotten dead are eager to taste life.
What is the lesson in this torment? What are we to learn besides the depths of cruelty?
Order is restored.
Something you wanted to talk about? Afraid I've got my hands full at the moment. Perhaps another time.
Opportunity flows within this city like its oil slick waters. One must only be quick enough to seize it.
Theft observed. Reporting to local authorities.
A tribute saved is a tribute earned. Which reminds me, can the Blackfeather Court count on a tribute from you today?
Which crate do you choose?
The point has moved!
On to the new point!
We can't let this crazy forest beat us. Follow me!
You got these for free? You're a sly one, aren't you?
Consume the fire or be consumed by it.
Died like a snow-back.
Like old times, eh Sabina?
You know what that word means? The one the High Elves call us? "Nebarra." It means "unwelcome." Clawless bastards! This one loves our nation and this beautiful land. It's the High Elf arseholes Nuzon can't stomach.\n\nSorry, sorry. How can I help you?
Z'Maja will … crush you.
I know some of us here in Summerset have been true de'nts about this open border situation, but just know that we don't all feel that way. For me, you're all most welcomed.
Oh sure, blame us! When you're the reason we're in this mess.
I am a Kinlady of Summerset, and you dare address me as though I were one of you common rabble!
Feel the power of eternal darkness!
I'll tear you apart, limb by limb!
Not many can ignore the call of the sea. Looking to travel?
We have welcomed the tainted Dark Elves and their perverted Tribunal creed! The wretched spawn of Trinimac, the shape-taker! We give them free rein in our hallowed homeland!
Touch my plunder, you lose your hand.
I came to see how the newcomers are faring with our hospitality. I have not been disappointed by the circus. It's so droll.
What would her bodice be made of? Satin? Muslin? Oh! Damask!\n\nHe tore at her damask bodice, and her luminous skin glowed in the moonlight. In that moment he was stricken with ardor.
Trade's picked up since the decree. Not that I'm complaining.
Hail to thee, Emperor. Your large armies will be no use to you in the Battlegrounds. I am intrigued to see how you adapt your skills to match these challenges.
The Battlereeve insists that you are a worthy fighter. I will determine that for myself if ever I see you in the Battlegrounds.
A merchant told me that Cloudrest has a toad infestation. Can't imagine anything more horrible. Those slimy creatures give me the shivers!
It's an honor to have you visit my shop. If you are looking to remind visitors of your great accomplishments, my wares can help.
Not every battle can be won, but a well-furnished home to return to makes the loss a little less bitter. Why not take a look for yourself?
Bright Moons! News travels fast in these parts. It says that this one's furniture is the best around. Take a look and see for yourself.
Generally, the Divine Prosecution is not in the business of facilitating trade. But with so many newcomers, we were asked to expand our scope of duties.
Raynilie the Stormhand, at your service. Don't let the name disquiet you. I'm not one for conflict … generally.
This is just absurd. Are the Justiciars really planning on investigating each and every crate that goes through this port?
I'd give Sunhold a wide berth. But if you must go there, my supplies will make sure you're ready for the Maormer.
The High Elves have some decent vineyards here. Russafeld and Alinor both have fine selections. Though of course, I prefer the dry reds from Anvil.
Maghumo kolektos!
I never realized how tough being on edge is on your neck. Give me a siege over a Daedric killer any day.
What good is a reputation that none can see? These items will display your accomplishments with pride.
Crouch within the fog until the indrik is discovered!
Not all the blossoms within the swamp have a sweet scent, traveler. Some carry a noxious gas within them. It's best to keep your distance, should you encounter one.
The deep marsh provides oozeworthy gifts to those with the eyes to find them. Your eyes seem bright as polished shells, beeko.
Do not forget to gargle your drink, beeko. There is no substitute for good manners.
Saxhleel do not fold metal. Our tools speak the wood, stone, and leather tongue. Even so, I have goods that may aid you. Come and see.
The spirit of the bear lives on.
How dare you use such petty tricks!
<Howling battlecry.>
<Angry Goblin gibberish.>
Behold! The might of the Blackguards!
Our tribe may now be small, but with your aid it shall grow strong.
I did not even know a Hist could slumber! And you are the one who awakened it? No wonder you are called Rootmender.
The fishing here is very plentiful, due to the village's previous isolation. Hopefully today I will be able to fill many of the tribe's empty bellies.
It's simply a cultural difference. Such imagery must be presented in a particular way.
You've done more than enough here today. Leave us.
I flex my claws!
Thank you for the aid. I believed my life forfeit.
So, what part of mud-filled swamp attracted you to the Blackguards?
Black Marsh has so many trinkets lying around, haven't you noticed? And the Argonians here don't seem to care about them one bit.\n\nAh, well. More souvenirs for the rest of us, I suppose.
There is no choking down this bile!
Feel the weight of our loss!
Fashion is ever evolving, you know. That's why I came all the way to Elsweyr. If you ask nicely enough, I may even offer a few tips.
My guild has the finest selection of wares in all of Rimmen. Ask anyone around, and they will confirm it to be so.
Not much for conversation, friend. You're here to buy furnishings, I'm here to make a sale. Let's keep it simple.
We Khajiit know the true ways of battle, walker! My weapons will give you the precision and quickness needed to win.
You will know the sun's fury.
I am her weapon!
I just wish the Mages Guild could do more. The people of Rimmen are dealing with Dragons, tyrants, armies of the undead … and we're powerless to truly help.\n\nI'll just have to put my faith in this uprising I keep hearing about.
Dragons once ruled Tamriel, you know. They were cruel masters, thinking little of the mortals that they ruled over.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they're planning to rule again.
Queen Ayrenn claims to be our ally, yes? Yet here we are, suffering under Euraxia's tyranny while the High Elves squabble with other races over the Ruby Throne.
Another beautiful day in Merryvale, is it not?\n\nLanasi often enjoys lazing beneath the sugarcane. The sun shining through the green leaves, the sweet breeze gently blowing …. Truly, this one would not give up her home for anything.
With all these Dragons around, no one cares about us measly bandits.
Rejoice! Alkosh has come to save us!
That was a Dragon! Right here in Riverhold! I thought we were finished, but then you … you took him down. That was magnificent!
I'll bury us both in stone and fire!
You call those warriors? They could hardly stand up to my stare, let alone our attacks.
I'm sick of these cats. The sooner we torch this place, the better.
I have trained for this moment. Come, and perish!
Baan Dar gifts us with a rich reward today! Let us take it!
Narazreshi bets Khasda wishes he'd been nicer to the Stitches. He will need sewing up if he shows his face here again.
You come here looking for a fight? All right, then! Let's fight!
Justice-AltF/B/Dragon
How did you get … never mind! Away with you!
Really? Must I deal with Dragons now, too?
Beast! Vile thing! You're an affront to Y'ffre's good!
For all that's merciful, just don't conjure my late mother-in-law.
Abomination! Necromancer!
Stay away from me, you boney bastard!
Justice-NorM/E/Necro
Please, creature, just stay away from me!
What have you done to our honored dead?
Gather those bones and leave us in peace!
Strike with force, traveler!
This isn't fit for a mead hall floor!
Everything I offer is of the finest quality, held to Imperial standards. You won't find any bent blades or splintering staves in my shop.
Do not let them use the helots!
Come, fools. Feel winter's bite!
You done good, which is more than I ever hear from Za'ji, but I've got nothing else for you today. Next time you want to look busy, drag it out longer.
Got to watch your step in the shallows nowadays. One of those salamanders almost got me!
You aren't supposed to be here yet. Neither am I.
We had a little farm once. A nice home for Tebabi. This one grew a little of this, a little of that. But now it lies burned and fallow—destroyed by Dragonfire.
Now here's a Dragonguard with a story! And plenty of furnishings to choose from, I might add.
Cold, eh? Good. I like it cold.
Knives out, Draugrkin!
Find your bravery, little ones, and face me.
A predictable outcome.
Let me show you true madness!
I'm not sure I understand the purpose of "The Burning of King Olaf" festival that is held here. These people burn their kings? To what purpose?\n\nI shake my head in confusion.
I love combustion! Haha!
Did you hear what happened at the other camp?
Look out!
Is that what you call triumph? Broken branches and snapped twigs?
The pikes are easily replaced. All your efforts are a waste.
Agh. My colleague brought in fish to eat again. How many times do I have to tell her?\n\nSorry. I simply can't—would you care to deposit or withdraw something?
Many goods for sale. Here!\n\nPardon me, please. I had an unfortunate run-in with a horse. Hard to breathe now.
Ah, Solitude. People here complain about boredom while refusing to step outside the city walls.\n\nBut enough of that. Wish to browse my wares?
This is the perfect place for our revival.
Kill, beasts! Kill till you die!
Be off, creature! Get!
Grah! A beast stalks the streets!
If you're looking for hunting tips, look elsewhere. My grounds are my own.\n\nBut I'll give you a bit of advice. Don't get sloppy. Organize your kit and clean it. I see a lot of hunters and trappers around Skyrim, and most of them are absolute messes.
A shame the storms only make mindless things and not more of us.
You ever fished under Solitude? I caught all kinds of fish in these lands and beyond. Grouper. Sturgeon. Quillback. Boga. Opah. Char. Skate. Steelhead.\n\nI caught a steelhead so big, it had a whole horker cub in its stomach! That's no lie.
What do you want? Stay where I can see you!\n\nIf you think I'm being paranoid, talk to me after you've found a headless doll under your pillow! Go on about your business, stranger. And don't tell anyone where you found me!
Sovngarde awaits you, stranger!
Wish we could sleep on beds and not piles of hay.
We will need more corpses.
We should not have to hide here like rats.
Divines help us!
More food for the sharks!
Old Nord ruins are impressively strong.
Destroy them, my guardians!
I look forward to your safe return. With your efforts, we can improve our relationships with the local clans.
I've been meaning to try this poison!
Good job! Let's find another ward crystal.
Why are these histories so boring? This one hoped to spend the day reading about exciting times, but these are full of nothing but political facts and figures. Makes Biro's head hurt!
What can I do for you?
Welcome!
You think you know what you seek, but its power is beyond you!
Drop those pitiful weapons so I can show you to your cage!
Into the stone pits!
I traveled all around Skyrim, and it didn't feel as cold as this place. Something about it … bad Dwarven craftsmanship? Dwarf ghosts?
I smell changes ahead for the Reach. There's more on the wind than just vampires and werewolves and their short-sighted plans.
My best deerskin breeches have gone missing. If you spot someone wearing pants that don't seem to fit them right, let me know. I'll handle it from there.\n\nIt's just not right for Reachmen to steal from Reachmen.
Laughter. So much laughter. The Reachfolk laugh. The dead laugh. The Daedra laugh.\n\nI wish it would stop. Not even when we got to Markarth. Then I found a way out. To here. Not really freedom. Now the stones laugh at me instead.
Remember Tasnasi? I miss her. Yes, I said it. Even if she can be a stick in the mud, she's my friend. Then she left. They always do.\n\nIf you leave, I'm staying here. I'm used to this place and it smells like me.
I think the armor they gave me is too small.
You go no further!
Princess Svana has grown to be an impressive woman. She will make a fine jarl. Perhaps even a fine queen. I hope this moment of friendship lasts. I would hate to count her as an enemy.
We Nords are a proud race. Proud of our accomplishments. Proud of our heritage.\n\nAnd our mead. We're especially proud of that.
I will never fight alongside vampire scum!
Reach savages! Show them no mercy!
Our losses were heavier than expected. Much heavier.
Bah. Let the Reachfolk have this place!
Meet my friends!
My destruction pleases the Exalted!
[excited Goblin babble telling best friend to attack]
Time to prove your worth!
Monsters? Villains? What's the trouble?
Taste our lord's power!
The Chamber of Legates appreciates your help. We'll have more work for you soon.
Give the order and we'll release a volley!
Impressive!
I need help!
Does the weather reflect Lord Dagon's mood, I wonder?
This had better be worth it, or I'm knocking him out again.
Destruction comes to us all, egg-sister.
Burn the butterflies. They watch everything. They mustn't.\n\nKill all the spiders. They seek power. They shouldn't.
Do we have to suffer the presence of those mortal fools?
That stench? That's mortal stink, isn't it?
Don't slouch. If Councilor Vandacia sees you, you'll be the next one on the altar.
I can't wait until our lord claims the mortal realm.
Kill them!
Your blood will feed the harrada!
I'll take a life if I must, but I take no joy in it. Assassins and thieves who wrap their deeds in fancy oaths and guild trappings have no honor. Murder is murder, and taking things you've no right to is wrong in my view.
I respect the local Argonians, especially those who follow Keshu. She's done great work in Gideon. Because of her, this tends to be a vibrant, welcoming place.
Prowlers are dangerous adversaries. Better to live with them than to make them enemies.\n\nThe puzzle there involves figuring out how to live with them.
Everyone thinks stealth is all sneaking and timing, but it's really a lot of waiting in bushes or behind trees and knowing not to talk to yourself until you're sure you're alone.
You will feel my arrows in your back.
Our work shouldn't take too much longer now.
I can work with that Assassin, don't worry, but will I ever think of him fondly? Don't make me laugh.
Why are people so offended when you say you don't like cheese? I don't judge them for their dislikes. Do I?
You're never content to rest on your laurels. I admire that.
Let's ride!
So the corpse-wife of an all-consuming-death-god whispers to her favorite murder-child who all her other murder-children should be killing. Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
So you've noticed my complaining? Well, good. If you want us to get along, maybe try not to piss me off so often. I'm trying to work with you here. Help me out.
Roll! Roll if you can!
It's all in your head! Keep fighting!
Easy! Let your magicka recover!
Do you recall that incident in Blackwood? At the xanmeer? Well, you'll think me mad but I must tell someone!\n\nI think there are still duplicates, following me. Why, I awoke this morning and thought I was a duplicate! Checked for goo and everything.
Why is it that Mephala is always depicted as some seductive woman? I've seen what her kids look like and it ain't that.
Say, would you call this a literal "rogue's gallery"?
I have feasted on fear to bursting, but I am not yet sated!
Surely no one can read all the books in a noble's library.
There's so much to do and so little time.
Get back here!
The order's honor is avenged.
Not a peasant to be found. We should take prisoners in the next raid.
These relics are conduits to power. Embrace what they offer.
These are my goods. Handle them with respect.
Service bring victory.
Our exalted Duke of Crows would judge this place … adequate. It needs more that glistens and gleams, featherless. Much more!
I hope it incinerates a good many of those cultists.
I assure you this creature lost its humanity long before it lost its life.
Sometimes it feels like we're prisoners, too.
Soon, my power will be ready to use!
Smart move. Now, off with you!
A mortal's freedom and you chose death?
Straighten your affairs. Then we talk.
Scourge the mortal! Punish them!
Ease off there. Hey, guards.
A pilfering mortal. How surprising.
I'm not working right now. If you need anything, find me later.
A mortal scholar presumes to know more than I. Do not be like her.
Why do we hide when we should attack our foes?
Such laziness! Worthless curs!
To the hovel. And my friend. And to more!
Only fools or brave souls walk these lands. Which are you?
Why have we not yet moved against Fargrave?
Sister Celdina should put Valkynaz Nokvroz in his place.
This is my corner! Get your own!
No one can keep us hidden away here forever!
No one escapes Lord Dagon's wrath!
You will not find food in the Daedric quarters. Dremora think food attracts mortals like a carcass attracts flies. Even so, the Stricture states that eating is permissible.\n\nSo, always be prepared to eat something that is not strictly-speaking food.
Keep it occupied. I can summon more energy pools shortly.
Ah, this is much better. No Madam Whim looking over Hezehk's shoulder, badgering me to be about my duties! Perhaps I will stay here. For a time.
I could see you with one of my shields. Yes, definitely. Please take a look.
Welcome back, adventurer. Were you able to successfully perform the task I assigned to you?
Let's eat these gups alive!
I hear something. Be on your guard.
Not good enough.
Sure, it's filthy, but it's easy bounty.
I've fought crabs tougher than you.
Be careful, I don't trust this thing. It almost looks like it's breathing.
Don't help him. This man cheated me out of everything I had!
Made it farther than the thralls do.
But if you want my head, you'll have to come for it. Follow if you dare.
The sacred rites of Satakal are not for you!
There are others who need a test of loyalty.
After all that Audrine and her friend the adventurer did for Stonelore Grove, I expect our circle will give them some amazing reward. I hope I can become a druid like her someday!
I look forward to communing with the Evergrowth. I wonder if Elder Audrine will instruct me in the process when she has some time to spare.
On a clear day, it sometimes seems like I can see all the way to Hammerfell. There aren't many clear days.
Have you not felt it? The earth moves. The gods are displeased!
Planks left out in the rain, and now they're warped. Great.
Flee while you can! We may spare you.
I love watching the big tough ones fall.
Is there anything you can't do? You just took down a dragon! Be less amazing, would you?
Together!
I need a real weapon!
I admire your technique. Not everyone is so deft with a blacksmith's hammer.
While most of the druids of the Stonelore Circle come from Breton descent, it is not a requirement for membership. I was called from my home in Summerset to follow the True Way, and the druids welcomed me with open arms.
Fine, fine. You win! I need a drink.
We do not have an age to wait.
Love this climate. Getting deployed to Gonfalon was a blessing from the Divines.
Not to rush you, but I might close up soon. After that last round of shaking I'm not eager to spend too much time in a big stone building. You ought to head for the countryside, too.\n\nAnd I'd stock up on food if I were you.
<Curious Faun grunting>
I hear the tremors are even worse out in the countryside. And there are fissures spewing fire, too. Take care with your mount if you leave the city.\n\nI wouldn't want to see a poor beast come to harm.
Eldertide druids listen to ocean and storm. Firesongs hear Y'ffre's voice in the restlessness of the mountain. We Stonelores find truth in the bones of the earth. Rocks tell stories, old and deep.
What do you say, Ghaffaman. Want to go double or nothing?
Don't let them get behind you.
I can't repair that part.
Anyone who supports the nobles will meet my blade!
Greed blinds nobility, but so will my arrows.
I grow tired of your incessant whining.
Listen, I just know I'll make a terrible ghost soldier. Could we discuss alternatives?
Watch Mount Firesong. The real eruption is yet to come.
Is it too early to visit the tavern?
Hmm. These walls are so drab.
Cheap glan'nt! Druids and their lack of coin. They've plenty of lint and dirt in their pockets, though.
If I don't catch a fish, you don't have to clean a fish.
Wow. We're really high up.
What? Well, I never! This must be the rudest squirrel on Galen!
You cannot stand against an archdruid!
By Y'ffre, we shall take this energy!
It is a frog's belly for you, fool!
The Stonelore are still settling back down. I'm not sure what they're up to. I'm so curious to know what the druids plan next.
Chef Rhazeez over there thinks he's the best chef in Tamriel? My father's burnt seafood stew tasted better.
Forge kindling, fresh saw dust, boiled mudcrab. Just a few of my favorite smells.
We have to tend to these waters carefully. A ripple upstream may become a wave downstream.
Rolmalnoril isn't an elder. How does he know all this magic already?
The fire-druids! They're hiding in the fog!
Rescue us from the Taskmasters, please. They'll kill us!
Excuse us. This is a private matter.
Magistrate Vox claims a powerful artifact. But surely it is not stronger than the Tribunal!
I don't know what you're searching for, but I don't have it!
Nightshade will work great in this recipe, but I don't want to kill anyone. Maybe just a pinch.
You're going out dressed like that? You look like a horker!
This might be salvageable.
I'm trying to get a logging job, either at Bonestrewn Crest or with Thulvald's logging camp.
To the side!
Stupid bard.
I wonder where I can get a few Argonian scales?
Can't believe these troll-sons caught me.
Mama bear isn't going to hold back. You probably don't want to wake her.
I think it's better that we stay here. Making sure nothing gets above ground, you know?
Well, I'm not so sure.
Honor and steel!
I've got this one under control. Make sure the other crystal is destroyed.
There's so much fire! Maybe this wasn't such a good idea!
When you attack the Dominion, the Dominion attacks you.
I don't understand how Helushk's warriors enjoy this!
Fair day, citizen.
Some of these Covenant Guards are quite dashing, if I do say so myself.
You're a disgrace to this uniform!
Are you the one everyone's talking about? How about if you drive those damned cultists out of Taarengrav!
The Fists are more concerned with the Silvenar than our prisoners.
Jone and Jode protect us.
You're not one of the Worm Cultists. What do you want?
You know what a hero looks like? Just like you.
In the end, you came to me. And the <<1>>'s been with me ever since.
Another adventurer? Rest for eternity my arse.
What is this?
Listen to me, you heartless beast! Monsters roam the woods around Shattered Grove!
Will you join the Dominion or not?
It will be our privilege to train you in the ways of the Thalmor.
The possibilities of this island, of Eyevea, are staggering.
Careful! She's listing!
Don't make me go up there to stop you.
Waxing crescent ….
Hah! Brave meeting, adept. And Mauloch's glory on you for all you've done.
It's a relief that Alanya is safe. I rather liked her.
You've shown your strength. I yield.
Happy? I won't be happy until we craft enough weapons to put a dagger through the eye of every living thing on Nirn.
When you walk in the room, everyone "leaves" don't they?
It must be a relief not to have Titanborn following you around like a lost puppy.
Last excitement we had was a month ago, when an ogre wandered onto the grounds. Ate an initiate before we put him down.
This one has full pockets!
When oath-bonds are weak, there is pain, and shame, and darkness.
It's a little underdeveloped, but I really think Prince Naemon could do something with this island.
I demand to know what you're doing!
With the invaders routed, you never know what you'll find in the aftermath! And what's more, you never know when you'll need a bag to put it in!\n\nI'm your Elf. Lenor, the bag Elf! Remember me, and come to me with all your bagging needs!
Take their bones!
Blasphemy!
I'm not saying I don't believe in Queen Ayrenn, but doesn't it tell you something, that so many people want her dead?
Yet another senseless kill.
Come to wet your whistle? Then you've come to the right place. I've got something to quench most any thirst.\n\nAnd I don't mind saying, our troubles have made Shornhelm a very thirsty place, if you catch my meaning.
I … I had the horker dream again. What does it mean?
Fools! Time is meaningless in the Halls of Torment! Whether it takes a day, or a thousand years, Sai Sahan will be broken!
Hear and know! Krin Ren-dro slain by Dominion operatives! The Eagle banner flies over Pa'alat!
My children are dying of hunger!
The Dragon may cross waters and mountains, but it cannot live in these jungles—it withers upon the shore.
I like Baron Dorell's approach. Straight to the point and no-nonsense. He's the best leader for Shornhelm, if you ask me.
We don't have much, but if you are that desperate for an old apple, go ahead, root around.
M'aiq's father was Qia'm, from a long line of Qia'ms. But M'aiq does not believe this. His father was a known liar.
M'aiq hears of shapeshifters hiding in abandoned tombs and secret forests. Ha! M'aiq prefers to lurk in plain sight.
When M'aiq enters a new place, he pictures it within himself and meditates for a short time.
The Learned One wishes to remain secluded. Turn back.
Are you here to kill me?
Stupid, clawless, incompetent fools! Someone cracked another slab of red brittle trying to extract the foul metal.\n\nIf this one gets the shakes, someone can expect a gigantic hairball in their evening stew.
Have you ever tried Voljar's mead? Better than that swill I hear they serve in Sovngarde! Better than anything!\n\nI wish I had some Voljar's mead.
Is the Undaunted obsession with robbing the dead a reflection of some kind of inner darkness? Return to me tomorrow, and we will ponder this further.
For Dagon!
The Daedra are re-taking that site! Stop them!
I need another ale. By Mauloch's right nostril, I need another barrel of ale!
Your day will end in fire—and begin anew.
May I help you?
Shor's bones, that looks heavy. How much is in there?
For now, the danger is past, thanks to you. But it will not be long before Molag Bal's minions gather their courage and threaten us once more.
I must get home to my children!
It rubs this one's fur the wrong way to remain hidden in our base; there is great need of warriors in the city. \n\nBut duty is duty, no matter how distasteful.
I walk the shadows!
Burn, wretch, burn!
You will perish in flame—you and all your kind!
Drink deep, my children!
To me, minions!
These sacs are helpful, but I'll almost certainly need more before my study is complete. Please, check in from time to time. I may have more work for you.
The Elven Gardens have always been protected by magic, but those protections are no match for the dark power of Coldharbour.
If you see any Xivkyn out there, feel free to kill them. As far as I know they have not yet restarted their mission to burn down the district, but it may simply be a matter of time.
In our victory, the mortals shall proclaim a third era. The era of the Daedra.
I thought this'd be an easy post—just hide out and watch. Toughest thing I've ever had to do.
You, and all of mortalkind will be forgotten.
She's calling for help! Attack the rifts!
Shaghila is glad you are here. Come back later and she will have work, yes?
Nothing annoys me more than a criminal who wastes my time. Are you going to waste my time?
Am I a guard? Of course I am a guard. Why else would I stop you and demand you pay your bounty?
I know you. You are famous! Probably not in the way you would like. Time to pay up.
This is all just one big misunderstanding, am I right? Just pay the bounty and you're free to go.
You owe a fine. Will you pay?
I love catching the ones who deem themselves clever. It amuses me to make them pay.
Consecrate the soil with mortal agony.
No, go away. Please!
Xarxes sees you and records your deeds.
I was never here.
Xarxes sees you and records your deeds.
I won't tell a soul!
Is that how your mother raised you?
It's a massacre, I tell you, a massacre.
That was petty, but it was a crime.
Tell your excuse to the guards.
I'd do something about that, but I just don't want to.
I wouldn't have done that if I were you.
No more killing! Please.
Please, leave me alone.
I was actually thinking of doing that myself.
This isn't the Wild Hunt, and that isn't allowed.
Someone's been killed. Call the guard!
Are you nuts?
I had no idea a person contained so much blood.
Violence solves nothing!
A criminal! What do I do, what do I do?
Your disregard for private property is abhorrent.
Such violence!
There's no excuse for that!
What madness is this? Guards, help!
Does it look like I care?
You just earned yourself a bounty, I expect.
I was never here. No harm done.
Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.
The guard will deal with you, criminal.
Whatever your crimes, I regret to say that I must report you.
Help! Someone is showing no respect for private property!
Someone fetch the guards!
Somebody stop that criminal scum!
Guards, a little help here!
Someone's been slain!
Are we done here?
This one's insane!
Why would you do that?
Stop that thief!
What did I do to deserve this?
Please don't kill me.
Am I supposed to be impressed with your mischief?
Please don't hit me!
I'm not going to report you. Not this time.
Trolls take you, criminal!
Can I help you with something, troll breath?
Mauloch knows what you did and so do I.
Scourge thump it! It's a thief!
Zeht's tears! What have you done?
Get away--or I'll call the guard!
I don't know what you did, and I don't care.
Stop this violence at once!
Leave me alone--I mean it!
That is not your property.
What madness is this? Guard!
We're very particular when it comes to our clientele here. We have to be, what with the king and his honored guests coming and going at all hours.\n\nI guess you could say this is something of a private club. Very exclusive and all that.
Half-ears! Split-faces! To the surface! Attack!
You don't care who you hurt, do you?
Another straggler? Trinimac looks poorly upon those with no sense of urgency. To the left, go!
More blood to honor Malacath!
Damn these fish. I need a spear … or a crossbow. Or a crossbow that shoots spears!
I never knew the Orcs were capable of building such wonders!
Oh, look—they want to make friends!
Give us more of those!
Know what I want to do? Drink this down in peace.\n\nKnow what I don't want to do? Answer some damn fool questions!
You've angered mother!
I miss Eastmarch, but the hunting here is so much better.
Bah! Our supply of webs is endless!
Every tale they tell of you is a lie!
Are you headed back to the city? I need to see a healer. I'm in real pain here.
I'll take a peaceful oasis to the bustle of the city any day.
At least this foul city produces one good thing—"The Adventures of Pirate Empress Thusa ap Lagud!" Have you read the latest installment? I can't wait to see how she gets out of this one!\n\nAnd just between us, I enjoy the bawdy bits immensely.
I was to be forgotten! Why must they always come?
I refuse to stay overnight in Anvil. Inns are probably full of land pirates, waiting to steal my supplies.
Classic Alexia …. Couldn't find her way out of a room with no walls.
Calm yourself, Chudan, or pay the price!
Plant the seed and reap the harvest!
I don't have time for this. I have a competition to plan for!
I tamed a scamp once. Made it fetch me my morning breads before I woke up. Scrubbed the floors of my house when I was gone to keep it clean.\n\nThen I realized how despicable of a creature it was. So I ate it.
Souls for the Spinner!
Fortune favor you, my friend!
Bugs and mushrooms as big as houses and guaranteed to scare the stripes off a kitten! This one doesn't know what in the name of Jone and Jode the Dark Elves were thinking when they decided to live in this bizarre land.\n\nBy the way, do you need a bag?
You look too skinny. You need to eat something. Here, try some of this. Isn't it delicious?
I've been saving a few items for that special someone, and there isn't anyone more special than you. Want to take a look?
You will not believe how close this stand has gotten to blowing up. Perhaps fools are soon parted from their gold, but I would rather they avoid my shop altogether.\n\nWhat can I help you with today?
Just listen to those Fire Drakes boast. Once they face down the Stormlords they'll break apart, like a rowboat in a hurricane.
There is no challenge without the challenger.
Still as eager as ever to return to the hunt? Hm! Good! I have just the beast to challenge you with.
I heard that nomadic Ashlanders travel nearby, but when I expressed interest in observing their movements, the captain of the Buoyant Armigers nearly tethered me to a post.\n\nVery vexing.
Airdeoza is not one to try to rise above her station. No, no, let her be safe among the unseen, the forgotten. That is where it's safe.
Lovely to see you! Please, tell your Dark Elf friends to stop by more often. I need a break from the rabble every once in awhile.\n\nWhere would you like to travel to?
I run a good, honest business. Not that the businesses here aren't good! Or honest! Or anything really. Oh, I don't know.
There hasn't been a new fashion trend in this city for a hundred years! I need to make something bold, something with style!
I've only just arrived and I'm already set! I've got this lovely shop to take care of, and the most interesting customers to keep me company.
I think my leather will suit you just fine. Then again, I'm sure you'd look great in most things.
This land knows its master.
Factotums will need a voice. Something consistent but easily replicable. Perhaps something comforting.
Functions compromised. Reflecting … reflecting ….
Now where did I put my pen ….
By the gears ….
Cross your fingers!
There's something fishy going on in the monastery, and I'm not talking about Adept Glaniano's regular Fredas-night shimmerpike simmer.\n\nBut I digress. Packs. I have them, you want them. Let's make a deal, shall we?
Psijics running hither and yon, Daedric cultists infiltrating High Elf society, stories of terrible sea monsters … it seems that there's a new threat every other day.\n\nMakes you wonder what kind of a game the gods are playing with poor Tamriel.
<Sniffling, runny nose.>
You'll never stop Scalecaller! Never!
Perhaps we can use those ice pillars to our advantage!
Combat sequence operational.
My respect is only for those who have truly proven themselves devoted to the Divine Prosecution's mission. But I must admit, you're showing promise.
Fear nothing, the master can mend even death!
You're perfect for my latest experiment.
You'd do better to join us! Z'Maja is unstoppable.
You shall be lost in my shadows!
I hope you're here to tell me of your tremendous victory! And not the kind that involves the local tavern wench. \n\nWell, maybe you could tell me about that later.
Strike them down, Belanaril!
Can you believe someone of my status has been tucked away into such a homely nook? My normal rooms have been reserved for some artist.\n\nWell, where is she? I haven't seen her?
Whatever you need, I have it! Probably.
This would be a wonderful place to try flying, don't you think? One day I'm going to jump and spread my wings for all the city to see.
Take a moment to center yourself if you plan to enter the Royal Palace. It is no place for frivolity or haste.
Try my wares before you go dry with vexation into the Battlegrounds.
Did I get an invoice in Shimmerene for that banner cloth? Oh, wait—the banner cloth wasn't for the Royal Palace, was it?
I used to guide travelers all over these coasts, from Corgrad to Alinor. But then those vile creatures started swarming ashore. It's better to stay in a place with walls.
Thankfully, neither the Sapiarchs nor members of the Mages Guild seem interested in drinking here. It's one of the few places where I can find peace and quiet.
I'm a little annoyed that the guard won't tell me how long my husband will be inside the Monastery. But we waited months to get here. I can wait a little longer!
Those shadow tendrils are dangerous! Be on guard.
Your shadow shall serve me well.
Obegh min non!
All that effort, only to fail!
My gryphon is not to be trifled with, you fools!
Have you ever thought of owning a home? Well, until that time comes, feel free to gaze upon my wares.
Don't ignore those spriggans, walker! They need to be killed!
We must use stealth while our wisp searches for the indrik!
No rancid brews here. We boil our eel-paste fresh every morning! Now, what will you have?
I erect the spine of cheerful commerce. Please, tell me what you need.
I've been hoping to cut a deal with the Dead-Water tribe for a while, but they refuse to trade with outsiders. I suppose I'll just have to stick with Lilmoth folk for now.
Even in death, I can still fight.
Murkmire, eh? I could use a change of scenery.
Guars are excellent for traversing in swampland. Many travelers are deterred by the fangs, but I assure you; all of my steeds are as even tempered as they come.
I want to see blood!
Keep your money - I'd rather enjoy your experiences.
We've fallen behind on the slave trade. Time to double our efforts.
These are not our egg-brothers and sisters. Not yet.
I remember when I walked the Path of the Lily. If Kishi is half the Naga his father is, these novices will have no problem acquiring the sacred flower.
Sad to say, but your valuables will not last long against the many cunning thieves roaming Rimmen's streets. So why not deposit them here?
You know, when I was recruited by this guild I had no idea how much I would miss Grahtwood. Especially the trees. Why doesn't Elsweyr have more trees?
Many greetings, traveler. Why don't you take a break at my shop? I'd be just as happy to hear a tale as to collect some of your gold.
This one has the finest weapons in Rimmen. Swift movements, precise strokes! All can be yours, provided you have the gold to pay.
Have a taste of this!
It's not everyday I meet a Dragon slayer! I can't help but be a tad jealous of your great victory. I just hope my wares suit your needs.
That's it. Now you die.
Conform to her will!
You'll never survive that heat! Get back to the platform!
Despite popular belief, many have theorized that Dragons still survived in Tamriel.\n\nNow we have conclusive proof that they simply hid themselves away. Or, in the case of the Halls of Colossus, that they had been forcibly trapped.
Did you know that it was Potentate Versidue-Shaie who sanctioned the Guilds Act? If not for him, we wouldn't have the Mages Guild, the Fighters Guild, and so many others.\n\nThe Akaviri gave so much to Tamriel, with so little given in return.
Zamarak's aura can restore your will!
I will rise again.
Justice-AltF/B/Dragon
Justice-AltM/C/Necro
Justice-ArgF/H/Necro
Bow and blood, it's an actual Dragon!
Get out of my sight, you foul creature!
Now, you leave the dead where they lay, necromancer!
Justice-BreM/G/Necro
Help! They're making the undead!
How many more kinds of monsters can there be?
Is there no where safe from these wretched Dragons?
It can't be. I just don't believe it.
A necromancer! Seize them!
Justice-NorF/E/Necro
Justice-NorM/E/Necro
Justice-RedM/E/Necro
Hide, wayfarer! Perhaps the Dragon will pass us by!
We smell your fear!
Our people are masters of colorworking. Speak of a hue, real or imagined, and we will work you a paint, ink, or dye befitting your vision.
Have you heard about this New Moon cult? As if we don't have it bad enough …. Now we have to worry about skooma-addled vagrants screaming about the apocalypse the whole night through.\n\nOnly place to find any peace and quiet is out here on the road.
So, how went the hunt? Wish I could've joined you, but between my back and my knees, I can barely make it to the tavern some days.\n\nOh, and no knee jokes, yeah?
Fighting Dragons is all fine and good, but they're not the only nasty problems out there. Want to hear more?
You've already lost your friend, next your life!
Hey, hey, I need you to do something for me. For the guild, I mean.
Never speak ill of the Coven. They're always listening.
This one knew you could do it.
You can't beat him in the air. Force him down or wait until he lands!
Show yourself, nikiriin! Face your death!
I'm not touching that.
You think you know pain? Ha!
There was a red mist … a haze, really. Then the storm struck. It was horrifying!
You show up unannounced, and then make me wait. Insufferable.
Did you just see that Argonian? The one with all the cats following him? People insist he's just my imagination, but he's not! Given that some folk here believe snakes are manifestations of Orkey, how can they question something like this?
I envy your vigor. The last time I swung my axe in battle, there was a Longhouse Emperor on the Ruby Throne.
Declaring victory before we've even begun? Oh, you will regret underestimating me!
You are weevils among cord wood. Irritating. Nothing more.
My last magic ring project caused one of our bankers to hate the smell of fish. I sell only my successful projects, though. Promise! Take a look.
The high king's daughter seems spirited to me. She bought something from here the other day. Knows quality, she does.
Ha! Yandir stands ready, little fish!
When the west falls, the east will soon follow.
This will not halt what we have set in motion.
I'm alive! Thank the gods!
Stay away from the portals!
Come try and avenge your kin, monster!
A second one! Kill it!
Filthy animal, we'll kill you too!
We grow ever closer to our goal.
Who prepares this evening's meal?
Ha! More training practice!
Fuel for the flames.
You've a knack for this, outsider.
Don't hunt in Wildspear territory. The clan'll harry and hound you into your grave if they catch you.
Adventuring brings with it great danger and greater burdens. Lighten your load, knowing it's safe here with us!
Look, I'd never tell someone to stop thieving. Just got to be careful.\n\nBretons'll clap you in irons. Dark Elves'll toss you in a volcano. But Reachmen? Reachmen do far worse.
Have you met the Nord Cultural Ambassador, Rigurt the Brash? Why my father continues to employ that buffoon is beyond me.\n\nDespite his bumbling, though, he somehow gets the job done. Eventually.
The leader of the evil vampire clan pulled out a dagger and brandished it at Adusa. "How courageous of you," I said. "Ill advised, but courageous."\n\nAnd then this one showed him the error of his ways.
The salamanders would make for useful familiars.
Imagine how powerful we'll be after this.
Don't send me back!
I suppose guarding the prisoners is better than being a prisoner.
Would it be asking too much for the prisoners to meet their fate with some courage?
They seek to rouse the Heart, do they? I should like to see that …
Stay focused. We have a job to do.
Gray Host over all!
[appreciative Goblin submissively thanking someone]
Such abundance, such decadence, such … aroma!
Ah! Such foul magic!
Take my power so you may stand against him!
The initiates require much more training.
I love how the screams echo through these caves.
There are many people in Leyawiin who need help. I have a job for you, if you are interested.
Going to turn it into a pin cushion!
Not what I wished for, mortals.
You can't evade my traps forever.
I wonder what this place was. It doesn't look Dwarven.
Stibbo no follow.
How can mortals hope to stand against us?
I'm tired of moving around. We should stay here for a while.
Be vigilant! Two of the Ambitions remain free.
A new dawn breaks! Die!
On nights when I sleep with the ball near my head, I dream of unsettling things I can't quite remember. But if I don't sleep with it, I'm extremely clumsy the next day!
Spawn of chaos, destroy them!
Out of my way!
Your blood will make rivers.
I never thought to lay eyes on this place. In truth, I wasn't even sure it existed!
After living in Gideon for a few months, I find it refreshing to be back home. I do not understand the proclivity of others to trap themselves in stone structures.
Trespassers! My blood will rot your flesh.
People boast about how good stinky cheese is. Why would you want to eat something that turns your stomach at the first whiff?
You've got a knack for stumbling across those things.
Help! Someone help us!
Potion! Don't forget your health potions!
You make me laugh, you make me think, and I miss you when you're not around. If that's not friendship, what is?
We drove them back!
Darling, how does this outfit look? I think we will make an adorable portrait!
You can feel the fell energies all around us.
Prepare to march! I wish to trample upon the worms of this realm.
We can withstand his spell from here!
Are you working with the Witchmothers? If you are, put in a good word for me, would you? I'm hoping to get in their good graces … if such a thing is even possible.
You'll excuse me if this one is not the most affable. The Witchmothers are creatures of great power and control.\n\nVanima does not know if you belong among them.
Oooooh, good stretch!\n\nCreeping around is real murder on the back and knees. I thought going on all fours was easier, but Seeks hit me with a rolled up handbill until I stopped.
Why so glum, Martus? Aren't you pleased to know I turned all that pointless suffering into something greater?
Die you vile thralls!
This ought to get the Prior's attention.
These two never stop yammering. It's all insistent questions and gasps of awe.\n\nI thought Quathynax overreacted when he stuck blades in his ears, but I'm beginning to see the appeal.
Freeze, scum!
Guards! The Nirnling pleads for death!
How much more can you pilfer before the guard arrives?
Ugh! Why am I always losing things?
Now aren't you an interesting sight! Most mortals would never dare get this close to me.\n\nDo you enjoy getting close to dangerous things, mortal? Like the moth circling the flame? Do you want to get burned? Can you handle my heat? I think not.
Vares Dredayn developed a new medicine. Hopefully, it won't turn patients into poultry. Again.
I wanted adventure, and now look at me! Working in a city on another plane.
Chirrrai misses the city when she is gone. There's no better place to find odds and ends.
Hope the yaghra like you crispy.
We will spread beyond the grove. All the land shall wither and die.
<Baa.>
I'm afraid I don't have anything else for you at this moment. But check back with me later!
<Mooo!>
Back off. This treasure's mine!
Who made you captain?
As sure as beetles crawl on the ground, one of the blessed ones must have sent you!
I'll call first round.
Information is a product I do not sell. For that, please talk to some of those supremely loose-lipped folk in the bay proper.\n\nNo, let us talk goods instead.
We're not done with those volcanic vents just yet. The threat will come again, just as surely as the sun rises. I'll be sure to call on you again when the time comes.
Dancing your way through battles, eh? Or maybe stealth is more your way?\n\nRegardless, your victories have earned you great rewards.
As the master wills it.
You've just volunteered to be our sacrifice!
Well, I'm better at Tribute than I used to be, but that's not saying much. Have a seat, and let's see what happens.
The Three smile on me, sera! I've already won three matches today. I'll be a game-baron by weeks end! Come on! Let's play.
The pride of Gonfalon Bay, yes? This one is truly blessed. Come, have a seat!
The Systres are sacred. They must be preserved.
A storm has delayed my ship? I'll drink to that!
You stopped them just in time!
Come on, let's do this together!
I never knew Tamriel could look like this.
All of these beasts are so interesting. Before I left home I'd never seen anything like them!
I'm going to keep a tight hold of my coin purse until we're well clear of this place.
Just a little more limbering up, then we can spar.
Am I to the left? Or perhaps to the right?
We retreat into the dirt.
Another day, another challenge, yes? This one hopes you have been practicing, because the competition is heating up!\n\nOr maybe just Kishka is heating up. No more of Marunji's fire-dumplings for Kishka!
How will you deal with this?
I made another barrier, take cover!
The Ascendant Lord is the only one I will follow!
Who took my mace? It was right here.
Where is that drink I ordered?
The work and craftsmanship that goes into building a galleon is a sight to behold. Truly marvelous.
Keep your paws to yourself, walker. Never seek to pat an Alfiq without asking permission first.
You know, I forgot all about Captain Renwic and the Pristine Halberd. Fine ship and captain both. Not sure what you did, but I'm glad to have them both back in the forefront of my mind. And it will be good to have them with us when we sail to Thras!
So many flowers. The Stonelore must really be pleasing Y'ffre.
I once worked with metal that whispered in the flames. A mage later told me that I'd broken some curse or other.\n\nHah, never you worry though. These wares are guaranteed curse-free!
In the market for a new bag? Nothing better than that new bag smell. Fresh leather and endless possibilities.
It is always a pleasure having such a well-traveled visitor. These eyes are always in need of inspiration and your garments are doing just the trick, Wayfarer.
If you decide to stay in Vastyr, be sure to remember me. We've got the finest furniture this side of Galen.
I'll spend some time communing with the stars tonight to honor Count Mornard. Even magic needs to process grief.
Just another day taking orders from Sea Witches.
Just a little jumpy, I guess. Let's report to the boss.
Think I could buy myself one of those nice mage robes if I asked nicely?
I've gotten into my fair share of scraps here and there. I'd say my blood and sweat has probably touched every dusty corner of Vastyr.
I wonder if someone at the Mages Guild could teach me to conjure a mace? I should stop over there and ask.
I have a unique perspective, having been raised as both a noble and a druid. You could say I embody both sides of the Breton legacy. I'm not sure how, but I plan to use that to better govern Galen and its people. You have my word on that, friend.
Faster! I need to go faster! Be ready for another attack!
It feels good to draw my sword again!
The Farseer says you're welcome here, but I'll be keeping an eye on you.
The shard of Wuuthrad. Gullveig wields it for evil.
I still haven't managed to catch one of the street entertainers. Have you? Those hats. Amazing.
The Three fill the world, like the land, sea, and sky.
There's the one who fought beside the Companions at Taarengrav! Crushed those cultists like the worms they are!
Hungry. Need meat.
You certainly have a lot of ideas.
I thought Crosswych was done for until you showed up.
You Altmer sure can't handle your drink.
The general's orders are to be ready to move out. And no, I don't know where.
Drag these intruders back to the ship.
These robes have been passed down from the kings of old. Try not to get blood on them.
I need <<1>>!
I don't think I can take much more of this. I can't sleep. I can't think. And the food tastes terrible.
By Stendarr's blade will we settle the score!
Suhr's inside, if you need help!
Marvel at its slavering maw!
Invite only!
… knock the light from his eyes!
Go with Almalexia, adept. May she guide your research well.
From what Merric tells us, Aelif will guide you true.
Have you watched the General's projection? Really watched it? Her eyes kind of… follow you.
This one knows that Senalana was once a home to the Ayleids. Perhaps that is why the Colovians are so intent on taking it.
I feel so sheltered as an Altmer. We must understand the other people of Tamriel if we stand a chance of ruling the continent.
What wasted potential.
Do you get in trouble for being so "knotty"?
The Altmer girl?
You look like a sturdy one! Should I treat you to my whip or my riding crop?
Hurry up! We have treasure to load.
The presence of unbelievers clouds our dreams and nightmares, cutting us off from Vaermina. Convert all you meet, slay those who refuse!
Now that Countess Tamrith is here, maybe they'll take us to Shornhelm. I could use a hot bath.
We destroy the wards. Then we destroy the foul hag herself.
Need a good pair of hands? Tired of bearing your burdens yourself? Choose a new, strong back from Hadran's Caravan!
It's amazing that there were no survivors. Were the Orcs really that precise?
Heed Yokuda's call!
Now, where did I put that spare canvas? It must be around here somewhere.
Mortals. Don't you have anything better to do than come here to die?
My partner wants to explore and take notes. As usual.\n\nI swear, if she isn't here when the Battlemaster calls us to compete, I might just set her on fire.
….
Embrace the new day—and burn.
For the Valkyn, my fire will claim you.
Joining the king's army was the smartest thing I ever did.
There will be few who miss Maximinus. Perhaps I'm the only one.
Thralls of Varen will die!
Don't bother asking for rat poison. I'm all out. If you're in the market for dead rats, however, you won't be disappointed!
Scamps! I need more scamps!
How can you wander around in plain sight like that? The Daedra will throw you into the arena with the rest if you're not careful.
You know what you did, you scoundrel! Right? So, um ... pay up, for whatever it was.
Here's the deal. You make a sizeable donation to the 'orphanage' and I'll forget this ever happened.
Y'ffre knows, I have the patience of a tree. Well? Just pay your bounty!
As you pay your bounty, I will make a full and accurate record of the transaction.
I hate to be a bother, but I'd appreciate it if you paid your bounty now.
You need to clear your record and I need to pay my rent, so turn over your bounty, if you please.
This one smells fear. Oh, wait. That is me. Well, at least one of us has the proper attitude.
You have two options: pay the bounty or face a beating. This one knows which he would choose.
Come, wrongdoer, pay up and be quick about it.
Fun time's over, you Goblin-kissing bastard! Pay the bounty or this law-dog is going to chew you up!
There's a nice bounty on you. Guard!
Call the guard, there's a thief in our midst.
There's a nice bounty on you. Guard!
You're a cold-blooded killer!
I'll call the Guard if you try anything, by Stendarr.
You stole that? You won't get away with it. Guard!
By the stars, somone's been slain.
What butchery.
The guards will not allow this.
Leave this place and never return.
How dare you kill someone.
You have been marked.
I'll forget if you will.
You're scaring me. Stay back!
Stupid. So stupid.
Hey, we all have to make a living, right?
No need to worry about me, I'm scared of my own shadow.
I have enough problems as it is.
I make it a habit to mind my own business.
Death is too good for me, friend.
You do know I can see you?
You do know I can see you?
For the love of Mara, did you really have to do that?
Of all the outrageous--Guard!
Whatever you're planning, you might want to reconsider.
Please, you don't have to kill me too!
Eyes of Akatosh!
You'll pay for that!
A slayer of innocents walks free.
I want nothing to do with this, so leave me be.
Stop that thief!
As far as I'm concerned, this is a matter for you and the Three.
Your face is going to look good on a wanted poster.
Scourge take you, criminal!
Who would do such a horrible thing!
Stop acting like a flat-head.
Who would do such a horrible thing!
Nice try, muskarse!
This one should claw your eyes out for what you've done.
Guard. Come quickly. I've spotted a lawbreaker!
Moons protect us!
Why would you want to hurt me?
Why would you want to hurt me?
Careful you don't fall afoul of the law, walker.
Hey horker, did you know there's a bounty on your head?
I have enough problems, so let's say I never saw a thing.
Not a step closer!
Someone alert the guards.
I'd rather stay out of other people's problems.
Your crime is none of my concern.
There was no honor in that.
There's nothing secret around here.
I have no words to describe you, none at all.
Somebody call the guards.
Please don't murder me.
Guard! Stop that thief!
Please, I didn't see anything. I swear it.
I'm calling the Guard, Goblin-spawn.
Guards take this mangy dog.
I will call the guard if I must. Move on.
Oblivion awaits, criminal dog!
Pay attention, you Daedra—it's never the same twice!
Find yourself a shovel and help me!
My husband mingles with the guests while I run the shop. Typical.
I'm so sorry, Yisraza … just give up already, won't you?
Ah … ha ha ha.
Such dreams and aspirations … soon to be cut short!
Raagh! Raaaagh!
You're here to use the forge, right? Got a few things that might interest you. Take a look.
Got the best goods from all over Tamriel! Take a look.
Vazh. Hissirna kassaad.
We just have to have faith, my friends. And maybe a little wine ….
Rise up, lighting! Rise!
Fall before the night!
Hope you've practiced your guard.
No one escapes the web!
I have heard rumors of this Scaled Court. But Dragonstar has its own snake cultist. Have you met Safa? She is a very good customer—for a cult leader.
Pardons well earned! Let's clean them up and make them presentable for freedom!
You need a home. They're warm and comfortable and they make for a better investment than stuffing gold in your spare boot.
The champion of the Covenant! What an honor! I have something rare and significant that would look great in your home. Take a look.
I'll burn you to cinders!
Very lucky indeed!
<yawn>
I can't wait to see the yearly yield totals. Should make everyone jealous.
Looking to do a bit of magic? Why not discuss it with one of the Telvanni mages? Trust me, they'd be happy to talk about what they know. And talk, and talk, and talk ….
Dead mortals disgust me almost as much as live ones.
The fabricants are getting up again. Durable, if nothing else.
The hunter returns. Was your hunt successful and your aim true? Better yet, show me what you have brought me.
The flames hunger!
You look like an honest sort. The kind who can appreciate a good, simple pack. Doesn't talk to you or anything, but honestly? Why would it need to?
All food I offer is free of contamination and poisons.
The clatter and scrape of old bones is music to my ears.
Spring-load your day with some purchases?
I wonder if Lord Sotha Sil will ever think to visit.
Sleep now.
Accessing general greeting array. Hello, resident.
A wamasu kills simply by existing.
You're nothing against Scalecaller's might!
No, leave my guests be! They belong with us now!
You've got the eyes of someone back from a fresh kill. \n\nAnd not in a bad way, mind you! In the very heroic, definitely good way.
We don't handle delivery, but I'm sure a rugged individual such as yourself would have no problem transporting my wares.
<Wolfish heavy breathing.>
Welcome to Lilmoth, beeko. There is no finer place to bask, wallow, and store your treasures.
Make sure to give Hircine a good show now!
I have no tears left for you.
<Taunting Goblin gibberish.>
Murkmire having no Daedra is a good thing, yes, but it does make for idle hours. Perhaps I will convince Hitari to hunt down some wamasus with me. I've heard they can be quite the challenge!
Do you have any goods you need handled? I am said to have quite the touch.
Sure, I could probably get a job banking up top, but I actually prefer it down here. A lot less stress, a lot less expectations. Now if only there were a few less stabbings ….
Have you read Investigator Vale? I'd let her catch me any time!
Where did you say you got this tip again?
We must not show weakness to those interlopers from Cyrodilic Collections.
Sa kot xulneihavu! Sithis tchee shu kronkassa.
Try not to take too much damage. I have plans for your corpse.
The young bloods of today, they do not know the art of true thievery! If only Dahzini was a younger Khajiit, she would show them all how such things are done.
At last, you return. Were you able to complete your assigned task?
Let the wretch burn! I want him to suffer.
Everywhere you turn, the flames will be waiting!
Queen Euraxia wants this place searched from top to bottom!
Ah, welcome! Looking for the Impresario? Actually, so am I. I knew I should have written her schedule down!\n\nShe should be back soon, though.
Khenarthi lift me! This one suddenly has other places to be!
There is no moisture in those bones, or in your actions.
Justice-BosF/G/Necro
Akatosh save us! A Dragon!
Whoa. I should lay off the flin.
Defiler!
Stop! To disturb the dead is forbidden!
By Yashnag's axe! It's a tusking Dragon!
Justice-OrcM/F/Necro
Our death circles overhead!
I'm warning you! Take one more step and I'll … I'll do something!
That settles that. Honestly, dears, was that really so hard?
Don't bark orders to me, witch.
Something big is coming! Ready your grapple-bow!
No one can fight the sea.
How good of you to join me for dinner.
Now, die!
I hear someone coming. Be on your guard.
A bountiful harvest!
This place is cursed or something!
Fall. Fall. Fall! She rejoices. Closer now.
Come to me! Shatter these fools!
My lord shall be pleased.
Is this all you could muster?
The lord knows how to bring your suffering!
My freedom won't happen if you ignore that oil Drathas found.
It is good to be rich, but it is better to be smart. Even better to be both smart and rich. The smart and rich crow never wants for gold!\n\nWhat can I do for you today?
Your flesh shall burn away!
Stay back.
There's an old saying about those who forget history. I don't remember it, but it's really good.
Haha hee hee hahahaha hoo hoo ho ho hahaha!
Consider this preparation against the Waking Flame.
It's only murder if they don't deserve it.
Impressive work. But sloppy. Off you go.
What is the point of your mischief there?
Later, mortal. When there are less hounds on your trail.
The paths of the Deadlands thirst for blood!
I don't want to kill you. I can't shackle and whip you if you're dead.
Is that an Undaunted banner? I think I've heard of them, brother. This might be an interesting bout after all.
I was about to head out, but I suppose I've got time for one more humiliating defeat.
I see you have a Tribute deck. This warms my scales. Shall we play?
You can't handle that power.
The reefs are alive and they heed my call.
'Til you've all had your fill.
King Emeric himself couldn't beat this deck, and I hear he's actually pretty good! Have a seat! Let's play a round.
Did we really just do that?
If that doesn't scare them, nothing will!
When I was a kid, I'd get up early in the morning and sit in the middle of Skywatch to watch the whole place wake up. I loved watching everyone go about their routines, smelling all the smells, seeing the sun rise. It was like a play, just for me.
You going to treat your favorite Khajiit to a drink with all that coin?
Fight now, stories later. Haha.
What would you ask of me?
Wise to keep your gear in good repair. Very wise.
It's about time that paid off!
I saw a bear tear into one of those corpses.
Y'ffre bless this kill.
Ugh, that last Stonelore wrenched my shoulder out of place.
Don't lay your egg there! You know it's just going to roll downhill ….
Stonelore and outsiders everywhere. I just want one moment of quiet and peace.
I need something to keep the phoenix moths away.
It'll soon be the anniversary of my starting work here. With everything going on, I nearly forgot.\n\nI wonder if Varisse would be interested in drinks. Perhaps I'll ask her. Perhaps.
That rug's crooked, isn't it? Oh well. I suppose there's bigger things to worry about at the moment. \n\nCome in and rest awhile, will you?
The last time I stopped for supplies, the merchant I spoke to was quite brusque. I don't see why. I even gave her several tips to get vampire blood out of her rugs. Such rudeness.
I was buried in rubble when Sinmur stomped through. I would've died if someone hadn't pulled me out.
The last of the invaders are stuck on their ship.
I could have sworn I saw a gem over here!
Get ready to face a real fighter.
If the registrar doesn't call us soon, I may have to get violent.
Kill them!
Keep an eye on them. They're sneaky.
As the Thalmor commands!
I've been looking for a new trophy for my mast!
Do you hear him? I hear his voice, he keeps saying my name!
May the Three keep us safe in the heart of the guild.
You saved my life!
<Whimpering, pained scream.>
I live by a simple code: no debts. Makes for pleasant bartenders and ensures my death will pass unremarked. Talk to me tomorrow, and we will contemplate death again.
Your money is my business.
All those years lost, gone forever.
I've been pondering the matter all day, but I still can't think of a good solution for these portals the Daedra are using in the sewers.\n\nSome kind of magical ward might do it, but I'm afraid I do not have such skill.
Did you hear that?
Scurry closer, little rat! The storm awaits!
We will harvest what's left of you, and your corpse will serve Lord Bal.
Bounty. Now.
Nothing matters. We're all going to die. But pay your bounty and clear one black mark before the end.
I'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding. Pay your bounty and allow me to clear your record.
It's not that I'm above bribery ... it's that I don't like you. Pay the bounty or else.
This must be some dark plane of Oblivion where I must endlessly confront filth. Your bounty, please.
There's a bounty on your head. Pay it.
The use of force is only required if you resist. If you pay your bounty, you can avoid it.
Look, don't make me fill out another form. I'll take your bounty and forget I ever saw you.
I do not relish this any more than you do, but I must collect your fine.
The Mer that mind their own business live long.
You're a killer. Help, help!
You'll face the Stars' justice, fiend!
By Auri-El's hand!
Disgraceful.
Cut down in cold blood.
It's a heinous crime to commit a murder.
Let me go and I'll keep quiet.
Don't hurt me. I won't tell.
Even the trees are suspicious of you.
What is the source of such depravity?
Xuth! Stop the killer!
A minor crime it may be, but a crime it is.
Y'ffre's bones! You're even stupider than you look.
Come near and I'll scream.
Why? Mara's heart--why?
Stealing is wrong!
You murderous bastard!
Oh my! It's a thief!
What in Oblivion do you think you're doing?
Not again! Please … go.
Why would you do something like that?
By Mara, how horrible!
Oh, come on … another criminal?
You poor, ignorant brute … you'll pay for this!
If the guards didn't see, I didn't either.
My my, you are a clumsy one. Yes, I see you.
I have a disease! You should avoid me!
Hey! That isn't yours!
Somebody stop that killer!
This one sees death.
I promise not to betray you.
My children will thank you if you spare me!
Stop that skeeving you … you skeever!
Please don't hurt me. I have a dozen little ones to care for.
I won't say a word. Promise.
I'm not a criminal. Don't make me part of your crimes!
What you do is your own business.
Call the guards! There's a thief on the loose!
I'm not a criminal. Don't make me part of your crimes!
Some crimes are small, but not this one.
You're pathetic, even for a criminal.
There was a time I'd smash you myself, but not anymore.
I know what you're thinking. I wouldn't do it though.
Someone stop that dung-headed killer.
By Mauloch, stop sneaking around!
I must report this. I hope you understand.
You won't get away with this!
You are walking the crooked path, wayfarer.
A welcome distraction, but so fleeting.
[Aggressive hissing]
I claim the mortal's body—afterward!
Your skull will make a wonderful mug.
Hello there.
Coolant medium under extreme pressure. Purging system.
You had me worried half to death!
More shambling refuse. Cease that clatter!
Another!
More clankers. Oh joy.
Unapproved execution is not allowed within the Fortress.
Truth always come to light in the flicker of flame.
Good!
Summerset shall be crushed beneath Z'Maja's darkness!
<Dismissive Goblin gibberish.>
However you may try, you cannot resist her.
Victory for the Blackguards!
The tribes owe us yet they refuse to pay!
A new xanmeer was discovered? Where?
I won't let that damn Famia get the better of us again.
Best to keep an eye on your feet, lest you wind up neck deep in a patch of quick sand. \n\nIf you do find yourself treading upon such ground, walk slowly back towards the edge. And do not panic. Thrashing about will only sink you faster.
You are different, outsider. Perhaps you are the one to deliver our message. Perhaps you will die like the rest.
You and that hammer go together like cheese and madness!
Justice-AltF/B/Dragon
My eyes deceive me, surely!
Heart of Mara, a Dragon? Here? How is this possible?
Justice-AltM/D/Dragon
Heart of Mara, a Dragon? Here? How is this possible?
Justice-AltM/H/Dragon
There is nothing for you here, beast. Please, just go.
Justice-BosF/A/Necro
Justice-BreM/G/Dragon
Freakish monster! Shoo! Go away!
Look out! Dear gods above, watch out!
Justice-NorM/E/Necro
Steel and Stone! That's necromancy!
I'll kill you myself, you flying dungheap!
What kind of magic is that?
A tusking Dragon! There's a tusking Dragon after us!
Necromancy? How could you?
Hah! Swine that bleed themselves! You're only fit for slaughter!
I can fend for myself. Shut up and try it!
Just more meat for the beasts.
Go on and run. I enjoy the hunt.
How many clans have sworn themselves to the Gray Host, you think?
Watch silently no longer! Take flight and attack!
Become the feast!
I was really hoping for more data.
The True-Sworn never fall!
You think you can best us?
You can't delay the inevitable!
<Idle humming.>
Since arriving, I haven't once been turned into vermin, frozen in ice, or possessed by evil spirits. While it's strange to admit it, I miss such occurrences!
This one defies our laws! Eviscerate them!
Oh, Litaalar is going to be so jealous when she reads my thesis! She's always been so smug about her research into the demiplanes of Oblivion. I'll show her!
Strike now, you've got them!
Such fragile flesh, so easily torn. Give your red waters to me, my shape is eternal.
Inspiring! Remarkable!
I feel far more at home in the wilds of our beautiful world than I do in cities. The glint of firelight on a bloodfiend's eyes is so much easier to see at a camp than in an alleyway.
Not quite there yet. Fire's still too hot.
The Gulakhan ate a guar steak. I haven't spoken to him since.
Poachers sometimes enter the Vale. They rarely get to leave.
Bring them home!
Shackles do not suit me.
I can't imagine how the Worms get used to this.
Turn back the invaders! Drive them from our home!
It's too damn hot this far south.
Ignorant trash. Next time, stay out of the way.
These Crypts will be your grave. I will ensure that.
If you will not leave, the Firstmages will put you down.
The one called Mighty Mordra … continues to draw breath. With that breath, he implies you are not brave enough to take the pledge. Prove him wrong.
Please remind me. Are you supposed to pay the bounty, or am I? Oh yes, you are the one who pays.
You think yourself above the law? What gall! Pay your bounty, you misbegotten outlaw!
The law wants justice. Me? I want to open you up and root around in your innards. Or you can pay.
As much as I respect everything you've done, I must ask you to pay your bounty.
That's it. Pay up.
I hate people. When you commit a crime, I have to deal with people. See where this is going? Pay up.
I can clear your name, but it will cost you.
Want some advice? If you don't want to get caught, become a guard. Speaking of getting caught ....
You've seen all the scum missing their left hands? That was me. So pay your bounty, or I'll start calling you Lefty.
You wanted a fight. Now you'll get one!
You shall die with the others fool! Mother, burn them all!
All shall serve me!
Rough times ahead for the Brotherhood. I can feel it in my bones.
Good supplies are hard to come by in Craglorn. The roads are dangerous.
Pacrooti can see a lucky aura around you today.  He is sure you will get something good! And all you need is a crate. You can purchase one from the store, and then we can begin.
You could wait until tomorrow, but why? You could also buy some crates for us to open now!
Become one of us. Blessed.
The Silver Dawn fell, but not I. I became something greater.
Can you smell that? Sweat. Fear. A mortal is among us.
The challengers have won!
Watch out!
They burned it all. Everything in flames.
Some doors, when opened, cannot be shut again. This is why windows are better options.
Does jester have one "s" or two?\n\nOh, apologies. You must want the Impresario. She's around here somewhere!
It's pointless to teach someone a lesson by killing them.
Take care! We shouldn't underestimate this one.
Most people look down on small folk. Well, naturally, but I mean all judgie-like. To a thief though, tiny means it's easier to be overlooked and slip through the cracks. Most folk don't leave their valuables on the high shelves anyway.
You ever think about what you'd do if you didn't do what you do? I mean, I'm obviously going to forge my legend as the Lady Twilight, but if that wasn't so obviously my calling—what then?\n\nMaybe I'd join the House of Reveries! I do like masks.
[Goblin nervously attacking the player like please don't hurt me]
You wish for correction? It comes.
I am the Lord of Fire and Flood!
On my honor!
Want to hear something weird? Just the other night I had a dream that I was the patron of a Tribute deck! Only problem, the theme of the deck was financial ruin. \n\nDon't need to visit a soothsayer to figure that one out.
I'm not looking for him. I've got more important things to take care of.
I wonder if the druids have any treats for sale at the Vine District today.
You've got to throw the little ones back in. Even a fish deserves to have a full life before it ends up on my dinner plate.
This place is nice, but I get restless. I need full sails and the breeze at my back. I can't wait to see where the wind carries me next.
Do you believe this alliance? Dark Elves, Nords, and Argonians working together. It can't end well.
If it were up to me, I'd toss every last one of you into the cave!
The plan shall go on, with or without you.
Kailstig the Axe is one of our bravest members. And you can take him down a peg if you take the Undaunted pledge!
Quality is your watchword—I can tell from your goods.
Now, restore me!
You have demonstrated the error of your ways. I suppose you'll pay your fine now?
Criminal, will you pay your fine before I ... wait, what was I saying? Anyway, about your bounty.
Let's not get excited. I don't want any trouble. Pay me your bounty and I'll be on my way.
If you're a criminal, then I'm an Argonian's uncle! But I'll take your bounty if it will make you happy.
Can we hurry this up? I have a prior appointment and he hates it when I'm late.
What's the matter? Can't hold down a real job? Got to commit crimes for a living?
I guess you can't help yourself. Doesn't make what you did any less wrong.
Justice is blind--and so am I, for the right price.
Save yourself some trouble and just pay your fine.
Be joyful, criminal! Your time of redemption is at hand! I will take your bounty now.
Why yes, I did ask for these. How did you know? It's been so long, I had given up. \n\nYou have my thanks, stranger. I'll pay you what I was to pay them.
All to the surface! All must come!
It's kind of strange seeing so many Orcs around. I mean, I'm used to city Orcs, but these clan Orcs? They're a bit too intense, even for me.
I pity those who deny my rule.
There's always more work to be done, isn't there?
Who put that in there?
These will avail us well. We're obliged to you.
Will you try again? This could be your lucky day!
Has steeping in death for so long dulled your appetite for life? Claim your reward and see if that thrills you into action once more.
Kill it! Don't worry about freeing me!
Bastards! You'll pay for this!
Our blessing will kill them all. Slowly.
Nocturnal is the dark, and the dark is endless.
We should take captives. We could use a good cook.
Use the ward! Get that corruption out of you!
If something happens, please don't leave my body down here.
Excuse the smell, but you must deal with it. Boiled fish for today's soup. I do not trust a fish soup if it does not waft in all directions.\n\nI will admit, though, that this one is particularly … pungent.
Farewell, my friend.
I do a great deal of worrying in my daily life. It's nice to put that behind me for a bit.
Sometimes I marvel at the creativity of hedge-mages and lay practitioners. I only ever learned how to shatter stone and melt steel, not sear a steak or wash my hair. There are so many subtle uses for magic beyond blowing up fortifications.
Qukikh, you forgot to carry the one again, didn't you? I thought so. Right. Back we go.
As you walk the roads of Tamriel, keep your eyes on the path ahead. You never know when M'aiq might wander by.
Heh! Just think of it. While Nass toils away with her books and her accounts, I am free to do anything I like! But how can I tell Nass I'm malingering unless I return to the House of Whims to rub it in her face?\n\nDecisions, decisions ….
The best thing about being a professional raconteur? The freedom! Followed closely by the ability to call yourself a professional raconteur.\n\nIntroductions like that really make an impression!
Magic cat, ready for business.
You look strong and fit. I have no doubt you'd make a good sparring partner. I admit, these days I'm far too busy to clash swords with anyone in the training fields, but I do miss it dearly. There's nothing like a challenge to get the fluids flowing.
Sub-optimal.
Once we get what we need, it'll be up to you.
The body of the divine wills us into being. Venerate the gods as one. For we are one with the gods.
You know not what you challenge!
You get used to the splinters. In case you wonder.
Let us keep this quick. Pay up and I ... wait, am I supposed to let you go? That does not sound right.
Bounty's too nice for the likes of you.
Scum like you gives scum like me a bad name. Now, come quietly.
Only the gods can truly judge you, but society demands that you account for your crimes.
Guilty? Who am I to judge? But I must insist you pay your bounty, if you would be so kind.
Try to run from me, will you? Do that again and I'll put you in the ground.
If I don't kill you, the hagravens will!
Liar!
Unlawful behavior recorded. Category: trespassing.
Tip-top!
I prefer to cast spells from the back of the line.
Don't ever touch me while I'm sleeping. Or throw things at me. Even if I'm snoring!\n\nThose who interrupt my beauty rest get the Evil Eye. And the Stabby Claw.
Some might abandon the last dregs at the bottom of a bottle, but I know a trick to make sure not a drop goes to waste. Azurah gave Khajiit tails for a reason, yes?\n\nI don't know what that reason was, but mine soaks up alcohol quite nicely.
Haven't talked to a Hagraven in weeks. Haven't even spoken to a werewolf, for that matter!\n\nThat's the trouble with civilization. It's too civilized.
That's got it!
No, you cannot have bread or crackers with my soups. A good soup does not need it! The flavor should speak for itself.\n\nMy soups do not need elaboration, substitution, or additional components in order to be enjoyed.
The mortal seems to be addressing us. Does it desire something from me? Perhaps if I remain quite still, it will simply go away.
I picked up some sweets but I can't bring myself to eat them. As much as I want to, I keep imagining Lady Laurent's disappointed expression. She doesn't allow such treats at her estate or even when we're traveling.

Once again, Qukikh, you opened a portal to an unknown destination. Are you trying to get us lost? Try again!
Pacrooti is still here! More crates are available to purchase, my friend.
My subjects failed me. They deserve to be destroyed.
Guide the philosophers and wizards, holding them gently in your sway. Teach them your sublime wisdom.
Come, fight us! Die your pointless death!
Deliveries would be so much easier if we could move them through portals. A bit pricey, though.
If you're sore, I can teach you some of the fifty-two sacred stretches.\n\nThey'll keep you limber, I promise.
Excellent!
Fortune truly favors you!
What did I say? Don't burn the expensive houses until all the plunder has been removed!
Know any good jokes? I just learned one about an Orc and a stork, and whoo! Let me tell you, the forge wife of the Morkul clan did not care for it one bit.\n\nActually, you know what? I'm gonna keep it to myself. Trust me, I'm doing us both a favor.
I've been working on a new spell to clean windows. I enchanted a broom and I'm calling it the Broom of Sparkle. Good, right?
There's no hope! We'll be its next meal!
You've beaten the odds so far! Now it changes.
Ugh, I'll die of hunger! Come here my darlings!
Until next time.
Everything will be over soon. Everything.
Resident detected in proximity. Greetings.
As the darkness swallows light, so shall Nocturnal consume you.
These spoils are much better than the last raid.
Get close before you strike.
Unworthy.
Adusa likes it here. This place is fragrant!\n\nMuch better than most of the tombs and barrows this one has sheltered in. I especially like the distinct lack of untamed spiders.
Nobody can drink like Thane Jeggi. His aptitude for consumption is legendary!\n\nI wish he wouldn't refer to me as a skeever, though. It's insulting.
Things I learned as a cultist: It's hard to get passers-by to look at religious literature.\n\nIf you wrap your literature around a brick and throw it through a window, though, someone's bound to read it.
All right, but next time you're helping me with something.
No one to cook or clean for? A life free from danger? Even for a short while? Why, I never imagined such a thing!
Not so yappy now, huh?
A knight never yields!
Stendarr preserve me, you have to hear this. I was talking to my father the other day and he said … what do clams do on their birthday? And that man looked me right in the face and said: they shellebrate. I almost died.
You always seem to be in such a hurry, walker. Why does Khenarthi blow you from place to place like a leaf in the wind? Slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures. If you are unsure how, just follow Tadali's lead.
You've only destroyed my whelps. These minions will not be so easily defeated!
The small, flying things that haunt the mortal realm? Birds, I think they are called. Yes.\n\nDispose of them. I do not like them.
Couldn't pay me enough to ship this freight. Bandits out there … behind every rock.
I surrender to nothing, except a notarized certificate of deposit.
Hooo hoo hoo!
Ember the Sorcerer, reporting for duty!
I will ensure no tales are told of your valor.
"A good day's work is sweet as sugar, but laziness is like the Trama Root."
I draw the line at piggybacks. Never again.
I reckon I can handle anything that comes at me on the road with good manners, common sense, and a full wineskin.
I find cities to be rather overwhelming. All the sights, sounds … smells.\n\nA battlemage requires years of ascetic training. Study, isolation, practice, and little else. I do want to experience everything I've missed, but preferably not all at once.
Litaalar was always one step ahead of me during our training. I may not be a stronger mage than her, but I'm certainly more well-traveled! She wouldn't know the Deadlands from a pond in Summerset!
Have you met my captain, Za'ji? His heart's in the right place. His head, not so much.
<gasp!>
That was it, right? Sometimes its hard to tell.
Wherever this goes, it will see much use.
I wish I had another three arms to help me write down all my research. I'm going to fill up an entire library! Good thing the Psijic Order has so many of the blasted things.
Ooh, that one was satisfying!
A friend of mine when I was young moved out of Gonfalon Bay to join her family at a druid enclave. I think about her sometimes, still. Wonder what became of her. Amazing people, druids, but they take their commitment to nature so seriously ….
Good. I grant you permission to strengthen yourself with my minions.
There were bandits on the road last time, but I did not let them claim a thing.
I hope you encountered no trouble on your way here.
Did I ever tell you about Klora the Brash? One of the largest Pahmar I ever met. We were in the pit, fighting for hours, but neither of us could get the upper claw. We decided to call it a draw. The pit boss was furious. So we ate him.
Amazing. You truly have achieved new heights of mediocrity.
Don't you cut a dashing figure today?
And we're off!
A lovely prize.
Conducting piston check. Awareness rating stabilized.
We'll see it done!
Wish I had someone like you on my crew back in the day. Aye, I can see it in your eyes. You've got what it takes. Not many people do.\n\nIt's a special kind of heart that can take to the sea and survive. You should be proud.
You've done more than your part. If anyone says otherwise, send them to me.
Too many people think Dibella worship is all about femininity. As if beauty has anything to do with being a woman.
Go forth, my yaghra!
Isobel Veloise, at your service.
You know, I stole an Argonian monolith once. True story! Took a wagon, four oxen, and enough patience to make Arkay blush. Never would have finished if not for the Argonians. They actually helped me load it!\n\nYou don't think it was cursed, do you?
I've been waiting to try this spell out!
Don't mess with a street kid!
Don't underestimate us!
A knight never yields!
All is not well.
Hm?
A few coins would suffice.
Help me...please!
Ah, you again!
Do I look drunk?
Cheers!
<Groan>
Help!
Well?
The gods have abandoned me.
May I help you?
May I help you?

Thank you.
I can't thank you enough.
Now what?
Ah, you again.
Well?

I eat well and stay fit, but I'll die anyway.

Honor and service!
If I may be of service?

You again?
Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
You again?
Stand and deliver.
What?
I beg your pardon...
I must finish this.

This is going to heal, right?

Quality and variety! Come see for yourself!
What?
It's been awhile.

Can't you see I'm innocent?
Back again?
Hail! Wait...do I know you?
Hey! I started without you.
Let's see what you're made of!
Back again?
I need help!
I need help!
I need help!
I need help!
Help me...please!
Now what?
It's more than I can bear.
There seems no end to woe.

Back again?
I owe you my life.
Hm?
Buying! Selling! Trading!
I'll be watching you.
Now what?
Hm?
Back again?
What do you want?
Stendarr guide you.
You again?
Yes?
There's a familiar sight!
Tell me what you need.
I need help!
Just wait until I am free...
There's a familiar sight!
There's a familiar sight!
Just when I needed some company!
Yes?
You've not forgotten me?
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this.
There's a familiar sight!
You've not forgotten me?

Need some assistance?
Yes, indeed.
What is it?
You again?

You're going too slow.
This...this is bad.
I just need a coin or two.
I'll be at this awhile.
Welcome, again.

You can't swing a dead cat around here. I got in trouble for that.

Good to see you.

Can't last much longer...

I thought I was done for.
Certainly.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I've never known fear like this.
What is it?
Ah, you're back!
Something I can do for you?
Help out a poor soul?
Oh, lookee here...
Just checking. Doing my duty.
I need some help here...
I feel so weak...
I must be cursed.
I feel so weak...
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
I've been hit!
Can't you see that I'm furious?
So much to do, so little time.
So, you've returned.

I'm weakening...
Well, look who's back.
Did you see his new bow? That must have cost him.

Ah, it's you.
Well?

Tell that toothless runt to watch his back.
Well?

Carry on the fight!
I'm feeling strong enough now.
What do you want?

Have pity...
My time is precious.
Yes?

My time is precious.
There's that face again!
Hello again.

Yes?

Damn you!

Help me out, will you?

I'm innocent!
You think I'm getting smart with you? How would you know?

You didn't forget me!
It's good to see you!

You again?
Wasting time is an important part of life!
There's trouble afoot.

You have business here?
Still among the living, I see!
I must finish this.
Still among the living, I see.

Hello there.
I try not to be superstitous. That brings bad luck.
On top of it all...here *you* are.
I've lost everything...
Why won't anybody believe me?
You look well.
This is...unbearable.
<Nightmare mumble>
Buying or selling?

I'm in your debt.
Do you need something?
At your service!
Anything I can do for you?
What do you want now?

I cannot complain, but that does not seem to stop me.
How may I serve?
Help out a poor soul?
Just hear my side of the story!
Hello.
Can no one help me?
I feel so weak...
It hurts! Oh, how it hurts!
I must be cursed.
<Snore>
Good to see you again.
I know that face!
How may I serve?
No charge to have a look!
What is it?
Ah, you're back.
What is it?

Care to try the local brew?
So much to do, so little time.
And then he said I was drunk. Drunk!

Sorrow and gloom.
Mauloch's fangs, how I suffer.
How can I help you?
Merchant to the Great Houses!
We like it quiet, understand?
I told you I'd pull through.
Curse you!
Fare you well.
Give me your purse.
I don't want any more trouble...
What do you want?
What do you want now?

Hello again!
I forgot what I'm drinking to.
I don't know you. Do I know you?
I don't know you. Do I know you?

Getting old is no picnic, but the alternative is a lot worse.
My courage has fled.

Doesn't seem like I'm getting much done here.
Please...release me.
Let...me...go!
Saluta...salu...hello!

There's always more to do.
Well, well.

A few coins would suffice.

The Dominion will rise, by fang or by claw.
That Orcish shade of green is unwholesome, don't you think?
Help!
Head out!
No.

May I help you?
Am I...dying?
<Nightmare mumble>

Don't give us any trouble.
Behave yourself.
For Daggerfall!
Now what?
Well?
I'll not forget this.
I'm filled with dread...
You again?
It's good to see you!
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
Take pride in your work, I always say.
I need help!
<Groan>
<Groan>
It's good to see you.
How long can I last like this?
Welcome back! I'm...no better.
<Nightmare mumble>

Not a moment too soon.
It's good to see you!
Honor and service!

Welcome!
I must finish this.
Let me out!
Release me!
Still among the living, I see!
Hello there.
Hello there.
<Groan>
I've killed men just for loitering. I thought you should know.
<Groan>
Hello there.
Must I suffer so?
Must I suffer so?
Still among the living, I see!
I...can't stop shaking.
<Snore>
It's been awhile!
This one can help you, yes?
You are most welcome.
What?
Watch yourself...I am in a foul mood.
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
Somebody...please!
Will no one believe my story?
<Groan>
<Groan>
Losing my strength...
<Groan>
This is...unbearable.
Losing my strength...

Must you bother me?
Not if you were the last Khajiit in Tamriel.

Keep up, now.
I'm well enough to carry on.
Oh thank you!
Let me relieve you of the burden of wealth.

There's a familiar sight!
Speak of your desires.
Help me...I have nothing.

You're getting quite a reputation.
Did you see that one's new bow? It is most fragrent!
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
Xuth! What is that terrible smell?
I've just about had it.
Take pity on me...
I can still remember. I'd better have another.

Too weak to move...
Why must I suffer so?

What do you want now?
Khajiit does not like growing old, but the alternative is worse.

Hello there.
Nice to see you again.

Not a moment too soon!
Such pain...
Must I suffer so?
I...can't stop shaking.
<Nightmare mumble>
Hello there.
Welcome!
Quality and variety! Come see for yourself!
What?
Don't trifle with me.
I've lost everything...
You can't keep me like this!
Why, look who it is!
You're back!
This ale is terrible. More!
Losing my strength...
<Groan>
This is...unbearable.
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
You look well!
Buying or selling?
What is it?
Keep it down. You'll wake the dead!
Why do *I* have to do this?
I lost it somewhere...along with my dignity, ha ha!
The pain...
The pain...
Time for a new lesson?
Must you bother me?
What's this?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>

What can I do for you?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Back again?
Hm?
Back again?
Now what?
What do you want?
Now what?
Now what?
Pick up the pace!
I'd almost given up hope.
I'd almost given up hope.
You return! Drink with me!
Hello.
I could use some help.
I'm hurt. Can you help me?
There's a familiar sight!
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this.
There's a familiar sight!

There's a familiar sight!
How may I be of assistance?
Who might you be?
There's a familiar sight.
What is it?
What is it?
You again?
That's what he said!
What is it?
You again?
He goes to the city for the pickpockets. He enjoys the attention.
Ah, curse it all.
You need something?
I just need a coin or two.
Feels like I've been at this forever.
There's no proof! None!
Someone will pay for this.
Hello there.
Hello there.
You look like you've seen your share of battle.
What?
My heart is heavy.
<Snore>
<Snore>
You've come to the right place!
You've come to the right place!
Your wealth is safe here.
Just a small donation.
You've got it all wrong!
What hope is there for me?
What hope is there for me?
Need...help...
You return!
Can I interest you in something?
The Thalmor commands!
You're going to brave my wrath?
Will this work never end?
Work, work, work.
Too weak to move...
<Groan>
Why must I suffer so?
Looking for a bargain?
What?
The incense must remain burning at all times.

Gah, this is awful.
No.
Well?
Hm?
<Snore>
Greetings.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Good stuff here!
<sigh> Again?

Split some skulls for me!
Well?
<sigh> Again?
Fear grips my heart...
Fear grips my heart...
Good to see you!
Don't look away.
I've little time for talk.
Yes?
Keep your eyes open. The Daggers like sneak attacks.
Good to see you.
Help!
At your service!
What do you want?
Yes?
Good to see you.
What do you want?
Help out a poor soul?
Let me out, curse you!
Just hear my side of the story!
Speak...very...slowly.
<Groan>
I need some aid.
Hello.
I must be cursed.
I must be cursed.
I must be cursed.
I feel so weak...
<Nightmare mumble>
Well?
Well?
He's not the sharpest arrow in the quiver.
I've been hit!
I'm mad enough to bite iron!
Can't you see that I'm furious?
<Groan>
Nobody cares at all.
Nobody cares at all.
I'm weakening...
<Nightmare mumble>
Well, look who's back.
The Pact, and glory!
You'd better be worth my time.
Stand back and let me show you how it's done!
<Groan>
<Groan>
What is to become of me?
What is to become of me?
<Groan>
Failure is success if you learn from it.
Help me!

Help me...please!
Hm?
Ah, it's you!
How can I help you?
Hm?
Ah, it's you.
Well?
Ah, it's you.
They are traitors to the memory of Aldmeris.
Well?
I feel much better.
I don't want any more trouble...
Hello again!
Have pity...
Have pity...
Yes?
Hello again.
Wait for it!
Yes?
Yes?
Can you lend some help?
Can you lend a hand?
Can you lend some help?
Ahh, such pain...
Can you do anything to help me?
Ahh, such pain...
Hello again!
Hello again!
All hope seems lost.
All hope seems lost.
<Snore>
Yes?
What do you want now?
Yes?
What do you want?
I'll be back in the fight...soon...
Ok...I'm ready.
<Scream>
For the love of Stendarr!
How about a coin or two?
How about a coin or two?
How about a coin or two?
Doesn't seem like I'm getting much done here.
<Groan>
<Groan>
A little less drilling and a little more action would be nice.
Should've joined the army instead of the guards. More loot.
What?
I haven't the strength...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
What's your business?
What's your business?
If we do not end this war, it will end us.
What?
You have returned!
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
There's always more to do.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Things have never looked worse.
<Nightmare mumble>
Trade, sell, or buy?
Do not waste my time.
Let's put some mead in your blood.
Why am I cursed with such a task?
Seems this is all I ever do.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Somebody...
I...love...everybody! Except him.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Rule number one: Nothing is too small to steal.
I say hang him. Let him twist in the wind.
Once the unbound Daedra is summoned, he must be forced to submit.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>

Now what?
A few coins would suffice.
A grave miscarriage of justice!
Ah, you again!
Do I look drunk?
Going to stay longer this time?
Hm?
Ah, you again.
Help!
Help!
Am I...dying?
I'm glad you're back. I grow weak.
Head out!
Hm?
Am I...dying?
I'm just as you left me.
I'm just as you left me.
Now what?
Well?
Who's got a whetstone?
I'm filled with dread...
I'm filled with dread...
You again?
I thought I'd been abandoned.
I'm guilty of nothing!
Those Elves and their magic. They give me the shivers.
Could you lend a hand?
Move!
Does no one care?
Yes?
It's good to see you!
Honor and service!
How long can I last like this?
Yes?
Yes?
Now here's a likely one.
Finest quality merchandise!
Finest quality merchandise!
You again?
It's good to see you.
You again?
You again?
What?
Nice to see you again!
I beg your pardon...
My wound...it burns!
My wound...it burns!
What do you need?
I...can't stop shaking.
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
What do you need?
Well?
What?
What?
Just a minute...
I've lost everything...
I've lost everything...
I've lost everything...
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
I'll be at this again tomorrow.
Why, look who it is!

What do you want?
Now what?
My sadness is...unbearable.
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
Can anyone help me?
Can anyone help me?
<Nightmare mumble>
Back again?
Back again?
Hm?
Hm?
Don't start any trouble.
Don't give us any trouble.
Back again?
It'll take a lot more than that to kill me.
You again?
You again?
Yes?
Now!
It wasn't me, I tell you!
Just when I needed some company!
You return! Drink with me!
Hello.
<Groan>
There's a familiar sight.
You're back! I didn't think I'd make it.
Yes?
I don't deserve this.
There's a familiar sight!
Tell me what you need.
I can't feel my limbs.
Yes?
There's a familiar sight.
That's what he said!
He goes to the city for the pickpockets. He enjoys the attention.
What is it?
What is it?
You again?
Travel well.
This...this is bad.
This...this is bad.
Safe travels, I hope!
I'll be at this awhile.
Look who's here!
Safe travels, I hope!
You're not cutting me off, are you?
Hello there.
Look who's here!
I'm fading fast...
I'm fading fast...
<Snore>
Your custom is welcome here!
You've come to the right place!
What?
What is that terrible smell?
You've got it all wrong!
You've a filthy mind, you have!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Will nobody help?
<Groan>
Need...help...
Need...help...
You return.
Can I interest you in something?
Sometimes a little lie saves a ton of explanation.
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
Two steps forward, two steps back.
Why must I suffer so?
Too weak to move...
<Groan>
<Snore>
Looking for a bargain?
Looking for a bargain?
You're going to brave my wrath?

Hm?
Help me!
Greetings.
Thank Mara! You're back!
Hm?

Aldmeri Dominion!
A familiar face.
Well?

Quiet, you beef-witted louts!
Well?

Fight...on...
What do you want now?
Yes?
Do you need something?
Don't look away.
So much to do, so little time.
Have you come to free me?
I shouldn't be here!
Yes?
Good to see you.
I'm not exactly known for my patience.
Alas, what pain!
Absolutely not.
Hail.
What do you want?
Woe and ruin.
Can't last much longer...
I'm...hanging on.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Hail.
Good to see you.
Come! Do your trading here!
Keep those weapons sheathed.
What do you want now?
Nine times out of ten, the cynics are right.
Oblivion hasn't claimed me yet!
What brings you?
How may I serve?
Help out a poor soul?
Please help me to escape!
Let me out, curse you!
I've never...felt so happy...
Strangers are about. Be alert, and keep your hand on your sweetroll.
I'm injured! How it hurts...
What is it?
What is it?
I must be cursed.
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Snore>
No charge to have a look!
Gold may be the root of evil, but we all need roots.
I'd rather be cracking heads.
So, you've returned.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Well, look who's back.
I can't remember her name. The pretty one.

Hm?
I beseech you
I have little time to waste.
Ah, it's you.
You've got the wrong woman!
Help me...please!
Help me...please!
No.
How can I help you?
Glad to see you...while I still can.
I can't believe it...free!
I've a fine selection to choose from!
<sigh> Again?
For Daggerfall!
Ah, it's you.
Ah, it's you.
Well?
Well?
Curse you!
Keep a sharp eye out.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
Yes?
Need something?
Anything I can do for you?
Have pity...

My time is precious.

I feared no one would come.
Help!
Yes?
Hail.
Hello again.
Hello again.
Hello again.
Can you lend some help?
Is that...really you?
I think not.
All hope seems lost.
Customers are always welcome!
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Yes?
Hail.
Yes?
Hello again!
Need something?
Let's not have any trouble.
What do you want?
I always forgive my enemies, but I remember their names.
What do you want?
What do you want now?
I'll be back in the fight...soon...
How about a coin or two?
Hello there.
It's you!
It *is* you.
I need your help.
It'll take more than this to kill me.
Hello there.
Is there no hope?

<Nightmare mumble>
Hello there.

You have returned!
Welcome back.
Where is that half-wit?
Whatever shall I do?

What are you doing here?
Hoarfrost Downs used to be a grand little town. Now look at it! Nothing's been the same since Ranser's War.
I am going back to Hammerfell and I am going to build a forge just like this one.\n\nImagine how much business I can do. I could have three smiths working around the clock!
War can be good for business, but not if I can't reach my market.\n\nI desperately want to make it to Shornhelm, but the guard refuses to let me through. They say it isn't safe!
Haven't had a good night's rest since my neighbor got those chickens.\n\nThey sent him to Alcaire to drive us mad. I know they did!
When you live in one of the largest cities in the kingdom, you can gather the best ingredients.\n\nOh, and being able to hire an assistant certainly helps!
The Dusklight is the finest inn in Hoarfrost Downs. It's also the only inn in Hoarfrost Downs! What can I get you?
<This man appears to have been enchanted by the spellbook.>
No matter what's going on in the rest of Rivenspire, we still have a job to do out here. And that's just what we're going to do!
Look—I have no interest in risking my money on this hand-held ballista contraption. Who would want a bow they have to load and fire with a trigger?\n\nI don't have any gold anyhow … oh … I'm sorry. Thought you were someone else.
Oh, praise the Eight you're not a slaver! Feels like I've been hiding up here forever.\n\nYou've got to help me. They put out the signal fire and I need help getting it relit.
I killed her. She deserved it, didn't she?  \n\nI know she did, or I think I know … is this real?
Welcome to my realm.\n\nBe at ease and listen to my songs.
Welcome to Evermore, stranger.\n\nI fear our court is not suited for visitors at this time, but you are welcome to enjoy any of the services within our city.
There's a good reason these people are down here. It's a matter of simple mathematics.
Take your time and browse, my friend! \n\nI'm sure you'll find I have what you've always wanted.
Welcome to Neeneban's Emporium of strange and wonderful things!\n\nCan I interest you in a lizard-catching net … or perhaps a trained lizard?
Your pardon, citizen, but I do not have time to speak with you.
Leave me alone.\n\nI have more pressing matters at hand.
It's a beauty, isn't it? Been working on this sword for months. \n\nI think I might send it to King Emeric as a gift.
All I hear outside is Montclair this and Montclair that! The Baron has been a true friend to the people of Rivenspire, and I'm sure he has a perfectly good reason for raising arms against the other nobles.
Shh! Just keep moving. I'm spying on the slavers.
This ship is nothing but trouble.
May Zenithar grant you prosperity in all your honest ventures.
Ha! Stupid monsters! Nothing gets past Mighty Marie! Best saw in all the land!\n\nAs long as she spins, the mill will be safe.
You don't look like you belong on the docks, friend. It can get kind of rough down here.
Please, please! You must set me free.\n\nSwing your weapon and break the stone!
Stranger, a word. You look like the courageous type. I have an opportunity. \n\nYou're sober, aren't you? Good. Are you interested in taking on a contract?
Ah, someone has finally arrived. My father sent me to this godsforsaken beach to round up some layabouts. I think he hates me. \n\nInterested in taking on a contract?
Quiet. I have a long-winded speech to give.
Thank you. These ancient stones are precious to us.
First we lost Camlorn. Then they turned back our offensive. \n\nIf we can't retake this camp, Faolchu's beaten us. Nothing else matters until this is resolved.
How in Oblivion did you get in here?
I'll be all right. I stepped in front of Lord Noellaume to protect him. The Red Rooks didn't appreciate my loyalty.
Arm's not broken. Just sprained. I'll be all right. I can't thank you enough for helping us get out of there.
I can't decide what I want to read next. Should I go with something scholarly such as Glenumbra's People? Or am I in the mood for something a little lighter? Perhaps Lady Veronica's Best Friend?\n\nDecisions, decisions ….
The book I need used to be on this shelf, but now it's gone!\n\nVaruhl probably placed it on one of the higher shelves again. Just to annoy me.
By the Eight, look what they've done to my city. \n\nAnd now the Lion Guard is being driven from its own siege camp.
All choices exact a toll, wayfarer. Some are trivial, but some … some linger for generations. I was forced to drink from a bitter cup in my time and all Redguards have paid the price. I wonder if you would have made the same choice.
O Noble One, I am a hard worker. Please, I just need a few coins to get back on my feet.
You need to get out of here right now. These mists are poisonous and … wait, are you immune too? Mara's bosom, what's going on?
You are bold to enter a collapsing mine, stranger! \n\nBeware, lest you share my fate!
What a mess, huh? Have you ever seen a city with so much death and destruction?\n\nBut one Orc's disaster is another Orc's opportunity, I always say. Want to see what I'm selling?
I wanted to run. I should have run. Mother wanted us to go far, far away. But she's in no condition to go anywhere. Not really. \n\nAll I can hear are his whispers. Tainted-Heart found Camp Tamrith because of me.
What can I get for you?
Not many still take to the waters. To me, it seems like a fine place to stay.
Welcome to what used to be the front lines, soldier. Something very strange is happening out here.\n\nI'm just a grunt. And not a very smart grunt, at that. Maybe you can sort things out for me.
Captain Hjolm will be forever honored, along with the others slain here. Their deaths will fuel our conviction to slaughter the Covenant.
Why are you here, stranger?
Quietly! The enemy abounds. What do you seek?
The roads aren't safe, but I haven't a choice if I want to sell my goods, do I? Why don't you buy something from me and make my journey worth the while?
I had to change my breeches before I came home. Don't tell my father.
This once-grand hall has been reduced to ruins.
My stock isn't what it used to be, what with the war and all. But I still have a decent selection, if you want to have a look.
Some armor can be too light, and some armor can be much too bulky and heavy. But the armor I carry is just right. Take a look and see for yourself.
Strangers aren't welcome here. Be on your way.
Writhing worm. You have no idea what you've done.
Soldier! There is a curse on the keep!
Miserable, cowardly Khajiit!
Everyone screaming, everyone dying. Why do you taunt me, filth?
Before you ask, yes, I've been following you. No, I have nothing to do with the missing people or the plague. And no, I'm not here to fight you.\n\nThere, that's out of the way. Feel better? Now let's talk about why Giron wants you dead.
<<1>>'s the name. I was working as a guard in the trading camp before the Maulborn attacked. \n\nThis Elven scout was lucky I came along when I did. She was getting her arse handed to her.
What do you need today? I just received a new shipment, so take a look at what's in stock.
I tried the drink at the inn, but I think I'll stick with our own mead.\n\nI can't take this local stuff. It's made out of mold or something.
We were going to expand the plantation. We wanted to trade the useless cat-men for some strong Orcs and Nords.
My love, I've found the right mixture. You've heard it before, I know, but this time I feel it in my scales.\n\nDrinking this will allow me … allow all of us … to commune with the Hist. We'll regain what our people lost!
Please show mercy to Vahara. She wields no weapons, nor does she harbor ill thoughts against you.
What's this? \n\nThis is my father's shield. Where'd you get this?
Where could they be? The pilgrims were supposed to arrive hours ago.
Experiments don't have to be boring. But they frequently aren't delicious.
What do you want?
How can I be a noble without my expensive crystal?
<<1>> has seen much suffering, but we survive. We always survive.
More soldiers coming? You know what that means. More mouths to feed.
When you've sailed for as far and as long as I have, the swamps don't bother you much. It's the people that get to me.
What is it you wish, child?
Welcome back, Deputy Envoy! Did you have luck making our cultural exchanges? We're still waiting to hear from the damn registrar.
I worry for the other settlements in Bangkorai. The Imperials won't just lie down in a ditch.
It would have been perfect! I had such plans for the Goblinization spell matrix.
Please, kind serjo. Would you help me find my cat?\n\nI swear, it's like he slips out the door every single day.
Were you successful in the mines?
We're safe. I would prefer not to do that again.
Just wait till I get over to that school and show them what I'm made of. They'll be amazed!\n\nWhat're you looking at, s'wit?
Thanks again, friend!
You were unconscious for hours. At least it seemed like hours.\n\nHow do you feel? I was worried about you.
<The dead Argonian's wrists bear fresh shackle-scars. A sticky substance oozes out from beneath his body.>
Mayhem? Make things go boom?
Destroy the Lens! Release the students from its spell.
Be welcome, my friend. We have few luxuries here, but we will trade with what we have.
No, father, please. Don't beat me! I'll learn the song!
Why don't some of these damn soldiers help out?
Maybe we should abandon Shor's Stone.
So the Maulborn lies to everyone. I figured as much. This doesn't bode well for Narsis, though.
The sword is but a tool. The true weapon in any battle is the body and mind that wields it.
How clever of you to have found me. I carry the finest merchandise and offer the best prices you'll find anywhere!
Hi, I'm a mood test dummy.
Hi, I'm a mood test dummy.
You made it. It's about time!
I understand I have you to thank for driving the Covenant from these docks. \n\nThe Pact owes you a debt.
You're interrupting my prayers. What is it?
I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it.
Hi, I've got a quest that you start from an inventory item. \n\nType ]createitem 1854
I've been practicing since we got to the fort. I think I'll be able to pitch in here and there at the edges of the battle.
Father and I are training hard. I think we'll be ready.
I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it.
They seem very intent, yes? Training as if there is no tomorrow.\n\nI think perhaps it is time I went west to join my cousins in Lukiul Uxith.
The barracks are clear. How did you fare against Halskar?
After all we've been through, I'm just so tired. So tired.
Eh, you're a fine one, aren't you? S'jash say we take orders from you, no questions.\n\nMaybe I'm done with this place now. No offense, friend.
There's nothing in this city worth doing. It's all snow and more snow.\n\nNot a decent cornerclub anywhere. Someone really should open one.
The last sunset stained the land like a great battle. It seemed a portent.\n\nWho knows what the next eve will bring?
Damn that brother of mine. Went and got himself killed.\n\nAnd damn the Daggers, too. Every single last one of them.
Man, I hate this place. It's filthy and full of filthy people. I just, well, I just hate this place. I like being outside.
Something in the story seeks to destroy me. You must not allow this!\n\nI will summon my allies, but I cannot do this alone. Will you help?
An outsider? Jaruk has not seen one in many years. Outsiders tend to fear us.\n\nCome, pull up a chair. Let us entertain you. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Please, help. The Orcs ….
I'd like to taste boar someday. Maybe seasoned with thunderbug legs.
Not all Bosmer wish me to be united with the Green Lady. Thankfully, I have allies like you.
I need you to wait by the docks for my signal - they'll never know what hit 'em!\n\nWait, you're not one of mine. You've stumbled into the wrong place, stranger.
I love setting things on fire!
How can we hope to defeat the evil that surrounds us?
Those cultists ruined any chance we had of establishing contact with the Falmer. We were so close, damn them.
Why hold a summit in such a frigid place? You want our respect? Come to Mournhold and dine like real nobles. Don't send us on a damn camping trip.
You don't find a hero of the Pact on your doorstep without a reason. What brings you to a backwater like Fullhelm?
Pinooh is always happy to meet new people.
Isn't <<1>> just charming? He's seen so much, yet he told me he's never seen anything so beautiful as … as …. \n\nOur fort. Er … excuse me.
Were you able to catch Thorulf?
Greetings, honored one. I trust your travels have been pleasant?
My prayers are answered!\n\nPlease, lend me your talents for a time. My comrades have been captured.
Darkwater, across the river, is crawling with trolls. The poor Argonians that were living there probably ended up as troll food.\n\nI can't think of a worse way to go than that.
Velyn Harbor's being overrun. We have to do something!
It's been a long time since I've handled a weapon.
If you follow this road, you'll cross into the Rift.
If you've come to join the Quickstep Bandits, you're too late. The Black Daggers killed my whole gang. But they'll pay, if it's the last thing I do!
I don't see that bard fellow with you. Did those creatures kill him?
How goes the search?
Another local. How lucky I must be today.
You'll need more than claws to get through well-forged armor. A small sword in between the cracks does the job in half the time!
What's done once will be done again.
We did it! We played at the handfasting! I hope this makes Dadazi happy.
Which do you like better—the drummer, or the flautist? I'm partial to the dancer, myself. Very provocative.
<This Dark Elf appears to have died beside a nest of kwama eggs.>
Ahh. I saw you around at Geirmund's. Here to save me. How nice! \n\nHow nice.
I can hear the ghosts wailing outside. What do they want with us?
The Maulborn really made a mess of things.\n\nWe've got a lot to clean up before we're ready to open.
Mastering a weapon can take a lifetime. Of course, it helps when the weapon's a masterpiece. \n\nLucky for you, that's all I sell.
Hurry up. I've got me some hot metal to work.
What can I help you with? Something mystical, I hope.
Eh, what's that? Barely understand you people from around here. I'm no scholar myself, but at least I know normal speech!
Lots of people in Windhelm right now. It's rather exciting.
I'm trying not to be angry at Magistrix Vox. She's misguided and lost.\n\nI'll redouble my prayers for her.
Well met, traveler. Good to have another strong arm in the field.
Nope, not on my list. Can't take any shipments unless you're on my list. No exceptions.
We're missing a few barrels, but that's understandable. This must be the seediest place I've ever brought trade to, but I keep coming back.\n\nWhen the coin's this good, it's hard to turn down.
My sister came to ask the Tribunal to reprimand Shad Astula's irresponsible mages. She's seeking a compromise when she should be demanding recompense!
Oh … who would do this, and why? Am I being punished? Why take my family and leave me to suffer?
The chill at nightfall can catch one unawares. I like to stay close to a warm fire.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I am just so tired.
Now that you see our true shape, are you horrified?
The Shaman did his best, but we need this to end, now!
Are you enjoying yourself at this fine celebration?
What I wouldn't give to be in a nice warm inn, drinking a pint of ale. Or three.
Just get me some food in my belly and I'll be back at those stairs.\n\nDamned avalanche didn't kill me. I'm not going to give up now.
Excuse me, I am much too busy to deal with you right now.
You will always be welcome in Crosswych.
You don't want to talk to me. Yves is the smart one, apparently. I do the work, he drinks the ale. Yes, don't waste your time talking to the dumb Admand brother.
Maybe you can convince Ravila. She's actually talking about breaking the rules.\n\nBy the Tribunal, that's just not done!
Lunk likes the pretty sky. And the rocks. Lunk likes rocks.
The registrar still won't see us. And now our guar steaks are beginning to spoil in their carts.
The Maulborn turned out to be evil. I never would have believed it!
Rats in the supplies. Lord Vivec sent them, I know it. Just as in the scriptures … a living parable!
Why do we have to wait for the registrar? It's taking so long!
Where do you think you're going? We're in line here.
Oh, are you here to clean? I think the fire pit needs sweeping, and my daughter always leaves spell components in the corners. Be quick about it, please.
This book is fascinating. It attempts to disprove the fourteenth law of arcane pyrodynamics by applying Magnus' theorem of non-conjoined thaumaturgic vectors to Geirmund's system of harmonic resonance. \n\nWhat do you think?
Got to get the old planks ready. The Perch are biting off the coast!
Molag Bal plays such cruel games with the people of his realm.\n\nTo put those who have failed in their life in a never ending battle, it's just, I don't want to think about it.\n\nI'm thankful that you saved me. What now?
To have come so far, and be turned away at the gate. Damn the Skywatch guard!
You helped us get out of that terrible place. I won't forget that.
By the First Forge! Welcome, bloodkin.
Have you seen Brielus? Is he still setting up that stupid tent? He thinks our house is about to fall down, but I'll chance it. I'm not sleeping in a tent.
Do you have a comb? These damn slavers messed up my hair.
I don't know why everyone's standing around. We don't fish? We won't eat!
Look, I just want to do what's right. Anyone who wants to grab a pole can fish, but I won't turn over our catch for free.
First time Mari's been able to sleep since Sinmur's attack. Please don't wake her.
Well, I must say, I was quite annoyed with those Red Rook ruffians. They took anything that wasn't nailed down.
I have as much sympathy as the next soldier, but I don't think I can take much more of this woman's incessant whining.
I miss the swamp already, but I'm also looking forward to attending the Academy.
You know, it's good not to be the weirdest thing in town for a change.
Did you happen to see a beautiful woman with fiery red hair walk out of the inn? Yeah, neither did I. Damn.
<The Khajiit's dead face is frozen in a rictus of pain.>
Watch yourself traveling these roads alone, stranger.
The Fighters Guild won't let me join, just because I don't know how to fight!\n\nIf I can't join, how am I supposed to learn? It's just not fair.
Collecting a bounty seems like a decent way to make some money. I could pay for some improvements to my house!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not thrilled about the chance that I might die.
Drunk? No.\n\nNo no no no no. Not drunk.
This is the part where I trust you.
I've spoken to some of the Mabrigash Wisewomen. They've been perfectly polite.
This isn't good. I wish my partner Varon was here. He'd know what to do. Wait, no I don't. Varon would wring my neck for being down here.\n\nSo, um, fair warning. This could be bad. Real bad.
I shouldn't talk with my mouth full, but I can't stop eating!\n\nThis bread is wonderful! Warm and chewy and … oh … so, so good!
Nothing to see here! This one just forgot her key.\n\nYamaea is a servant in this house, but now she can't get back inside. She sincerely hopes she has not done anything to offend her generous employer.
What brings you to this trashpit?
I came to see if the king of this land needed soldiers, but xuth! These Bretons are most unfriendly to outsiders. \n\nNow I just sit and drink and wait for work to come my way.
I shouldn't have stood up. Look how swollen that ankle is.
I knew Ela would find someone to help us. But even with our lives saved, what about our livelihood?
If you're the best of the best, I'll give you some of the best gear we've got.\n\nIf you're another half-wit recruit looking for a quick advantage over our enemies, you're wasting my time, soldier.
Seems like our war with the Dominion and the Pact never ends.\n\nThat's why it's a good idea to never let up on your training.
If the others were unharmed, maybe there is hope for my sweet <<1>>!
I'd still be in <<1>> if those blasted Houndsmen hadn't stirred up trouble.\n\nMaybe <<2>> will come to his senses soon.
Please hurry! If nobody stops them they'll eat everything, even the trees!
I thought we would be moving on by now, but the general wants us to put up more walls.\n\nThat means I don't have much time to talk to wanderers. Excuse me.
I'm looking forward to seeing Jakarn in action. I hear he's an incredible sailor. Lots of … stamina.
Wherever Captain Lerisa goes, I go. Even on this tub. Can't wait until we get our own ship again.
I can't hold a sword yet, but I can hold a book. Perhaps I should find a book that will teach me to fight with my left hand!
I think I'm on the verge of a breakthrough. Stand back! This could be messy.
I still can't believe this is happening. The forest has never turned on us before.\n\nAnd there are so few of us now. I hate to say it, but this might really be the end of Deleyn's Mill.
Khajiit make me nervous. We must be desperate to be hiring all these conscripts.
The melodies ease my mind. I like being around all these musicians.
Come, sit by the fire. Nice and warm.
Wanna drink? Better than the stuff the tavern serves!
I'm sorry, but I don't really feel like talking. I've been trying to find a quiet minute all day. \n\nI need to pray for my son. He's missing, you see.
Who's there? I thought I said I wasn't to be disturbed!
Just when things were settling down, the Khajiit make a mess.
You … you are not one of them. You have not the taint. Help us. Free us from this torment!
One definitely tires of seeing one's own blood.
You're not a Supernal Dreamer. Who are you?
No one said anything about haunted ruins and necromancers! I didn't sign up for this.
Foul cultists, defiling the souls of the dead. I hope we find more of them so I can cut down a few myself.
I don't trust that Khajiit as far I can throw him, but then again, I don't have to pay him much.
Fair breezes unto you! I have all manner of needful things if you've a mind to buy. Please, feel free to browse.
The guards won't let me drink from the fountains. They won't let me climb the trees to eat figs.\n\nI must depend upon the generosity of strangers … like you.
Just keep moving. Around here, folks are as likely to knife you as talk to you.
Auri-el knows, I'm here to serve. What can I help you with?
Such a waste of the Prince's time. That such a great man should be made to follow along after Ayrenn. Like a tamed hound!\n\nNaemon is no hound. He is a wolf.
What? Not all of Clan Murtag are warriors. Who do you think they get their armor from?
Enter and be welcome, friend! Make yourself at home!
You're standing too close. I'm trying to watch the bard perform. She's very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean.
Strong wood and taught bow strings, newly made by the finest crafters in Daggerfall. And now, awaiting your light touch.
Interact with me to make me say an SAT.
The kagouti walk amongst the guar, but do not hunt unless the guar strays from her herd. Then wooden wasps would fly, bringing the guar down to the mud.
"Let's open an inn!" he says. "We'll be rich and have the time of our lives!" he says. We're in the middle of nowhere and get hardly any customers!\n\nWe'd have been happier farming.
I wasn't stealing, I just slipped and put my hand in his coin pouch!
Unless you're in serious pain, I can't help you right now. I have too many patients to attend.
The ale's weak, the bread's stale, and the weather's too warm. I hope this whole village slides into the fissure soon.
I love <<1>>, but it is good to see Altmeri faces again.
<<1>> was built on an ancient Khajiiti temple. Without proper maintenance the ruins could collapse, taking the city with them!
I'll not leave my cousin behind. You're on your own from here.
Just got to clear away this brush before auntie gets mad. Thank Y'ffre that foul green stuff is gone!
Oh! Hello, wayfarer. I am sorry, my mind wanders.
Weapons! Freshly imported from the mainland!
Please, leave us to our training.
Have you seen my ribcage? That milk drinking wizard scattered me across three of these piles.
The pieces begin to fall into place. With the King's aid, we shall assemble a force worthy of Meridia's blessing.
Welcome. Whatever Vlastarus has to offer is yours, for the right price.
I'm still a Shadowscale, sight or no sight. I protected <<1>> from the lamias, yes?
Our caravan was set upon nearby while <<1>> and I were … occupied elsewhere. I suppose we are stuck until another travels through here.
Oh! Come to sample our honey-mead?\n\nMy apologies, but we're running a little low at the moment. Hopefully things will be resolved soon and we should be overflowing again.
Magic and magical tomes abound in this strange land!
I still feel like such a fool. To have shared my knowledge with that evil girl, and the whole time ….\n\nI am very grateful that she is no longer a threat. If things had not turned out this way, I don't know if I could've forgiven myself.
Last load of logs broke our wagon wheels. Now Aetis says we have to cut them all in half.
Spare a coin for a veteran's meal?
Just the person I was looking for. King Dynar is rallying our forces near the Reaver Citadel.
Moth Priest Crassius is practically an augur. The ancestor moths sing to him, when outsiders are not about. His wisdom guides us in this refuge.
This one knew Ronyssa's daughter. She was a good girl. Full of life.\n\nWhat evil could have done this to us?
I will stay your execution since you came all this way. But choose your words carefully. I'm not a patient king.
Some think of my wares as trinkets. Think that if you will, but one of my trinkets could very well save your life!
It's well known that everyone attacks the least-armored foe on the battlefield. Don't make yourself a target—wear heavy armor.
You soldiers better use these furnaces. I'm not hauling all this wood for nothing, you know.
There's nothing like a good meal after a hard day. Sadly, this is nothing like a good meal.
Don't mind me. I'll be fine. It takes more than a few Daedra to finish me off.
Moderation in all things, including armor. I have what you need, warrior!
Ah! Another sharp-minded citizen!\n\nDo you also prefer not to be ravaged by Reachmen?
Anyone who wants to eat vegetables needs to find another cook!
General Braning is a harsh taskmistress. My work never seems to end. Get out into the field as soon as you can, before she finds something for you to do.
Halt! No one passes here.
I've been following Angranel around for years now, keeping her house and making her meals. This is the nicest place we've ever stayed. It's usually a leaky tent with mud floors.
Dune and Willowgrove wouldn't be the same without your help, my friend.
Greetings, warrior. I have mounts for sale, if you need one. Do not travel Cyrodiil on foot!
I have some beverages for sale, but do exercise caution. The penalties for spell-weaving while inebriated are … severe.
The Order of St. Pelin thanks you for your aid here at the Garrison. We owe you a great debt.
And the thorn in my side returns. Your prince has accepted the gift I offered. He is a visionary. He sees beyond convention.\n\nBut what about you? Do you still question the value of my blessing?
Gravedigging doesn't pay too well, but there's never a shortage of work.
Look at your posture! Why do you hunch over so? \n\nWeighed down by your burdens, I'll wager. Luckily for you, I have many backpacks and satchels to sell.
I'm not sure how Montclair and his troops stand this armor. It's itchy and it smells like rotten mudcrab meat.
Letting a noble woman wander alone through a city full of vampires and bloodfiends. What was Skordo thinking?
<The soldier's throat is slit, and there are numerous bruises on her exposed skin.>
Are those two still arguing like kittens?\n\nMinshur finds it quite difficult to enjoy his book with them prattling on in this way.
I'll never feel right again.
Nobody makes bows like the Bosmer!\n\nNo, really. Nobody does. Everyone else cuts down trees, it's insane.
I'll tell ya, these Khajiit are tough on fabric. Mending claw-marks is a full-time job, but I still sell some goods on the side. Have a look.
<<1>> means well, this one is certain.\n\nPerhaps "certain" is too a strong word.
Thank you again. I made sure to put myself in harm's way to protect my little brother. Unfortunately, he learned nothing and thinks I caused us to get caught. \n\nAh, youth.
It's dangerous out there. Goblins, pirates, and beasts! What I've got here will keep you safe.
You can always buy armor, of course. But wearing pieces you made yourself will give you more confidence.
I suppose you wish to see my fine gems? I don't stint on the quality of my stock. Prepare to be impressed.
We're trying to clear as much room as we can for the refugees from Elinhir. I hear the destruction out that way is pretty bad.
You are not Yokudan. You are their enemy. \n\nWhy are you here? How are you here?
This one roams, for this one knows: Those who themselves roam often have needs.\n\nAnd Mulabez, he satisfies these needs, yes?
What can I do for you? It pays to store your items in a bank vault, no matter what's happening in town.
It's a hard life, traveling with your wares. I imagine that is why few do it.
I can't believe Klause and the others would have done this. This is all because of the water?
Of all the … oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Why are you here? This is my spot. Hurry, go away before they see you!
The captain wants a report. So I'm trying to figure out what happened here.
You may bank with me in complete confidence.
Take it from me: your goods are safe here.
This one thinks you have come to make a deposit, yes?
Orcs should know better than to run wildly past the Mages Guild. What if I had been in the midst of casting a spell? He could have been turned into a chicken and it would have served him right!\n\nHe went up those stairs like his arse was on fire!
We're trying to clear as much room as we can for the refugees from Elinhir. I hear the destruction out that way is pretty bad.
Such terrible times these are. At least we are safe here in Belkarth.\n\nI heard that Elinhir did not fare so well. In fact, I hear that the entire Eastern portion of Craglorn is overrun with atronachs.
Keep it nice and orderly. And if you see anything suspicious, let me know.
The Scaled One craves magic. But you have stopped him from gathering it. For now.
Thanks for the delivery.
Is that a heroic silhouette I spy?
INCREASED PROGRESSION
Mirri thinks you're the best companion she's ever had.
Sir Croix is dead and the Knights of the Flame are again united with Sir Edmund in command.
Muzgu asked me to kill him to stop the Omen from possessing him. I refused. Instead, we agreed to capture a Supernal Dreamer and trick the Omen into possessing them instead.\n\nVaermina will take the Supernal Dreamer and lock them in eternal nightmare.
I freed Azah from his captors. Apparently, he heard the Withered Hand talking while he was held captive. They have plans beyond a simple kidnapping.
Upon investigation, it was the Supernal Dreamers who actually gave the countess the cursed mirror. After they were exposed, they tried to kill her. All so that they could take over the town. Fortunately, I thwarted their plans.
The survivors' food supply was burned, forcing the camp dwellers to abandon the forgotten crypts. <<1>> is nowhere to be found.
I helped track down the source of the poison afflicting the Wood Orcs of <<1>>.
I have defeated Selene, an ancient changeling that was in conflict with a group of Guild Mages. Her power is now left to the Warlock Carindon, the group's leader, to study.
I've defeated the Blackrose Prison Gauntlet. I should speak to Erilthel and accept my reward.

The Gorinir family, a cadet branch of the royal Camoran line, has fallen on hard times and had to sell their palatial Cormount home. The seasons turn, luck changes, and their loss is your gain.
Even if you don't personally have a taste for the famous fire-pit dancing at the Flaming Nix, you have to admit it adds a certain cachet to having a room there. Not to mention an unusual fragrance.\nRoom is too small for Dueling.
You probably think only the mad masterminds of vast criminal organizations have their own private tropical islands. Well, think again: you, too, could have a hidden hideaway ever-trembling on the verge of volcanic destruction!
Sotha Sil's designation of this mountaintop laboratory as the "Orbservatory Prior" clearly indicates that the site was an experimental or test version of what he had in mind—though whether he ever built an "Orbservatory Final" is unknown.
Built into the foundations of Kvatch itself, this ancient complex was abandoned by the Dark Brotherhood after a subterranean collapse tumbled one wall of the Speaker's bedchamber into a massive natural cavern.
Ancient pillars along the Abecean Sea mark the site of once-soaring Ayleid architecture. Though none know the original purpose of these structures, some claim that soaking in the retreat's indoor crystal pool heals the spirit.
Those seeking a taste of river life without all the flooding can find everything they need in this cozy bridge home. With both the Outlaws Refuge and Leyawiin Castle just a brief walk away, it's the perfect spot for nobles and lowlifes alike.
The embattled clergy of the Quenching Grail established Pantherfang Chapel in the First Era as a bastion of faith. Part cathedral, part citadel, this edifice still stands as an immortal reminder of Aedric strength. Allows use of the Pledge of Mara.
Early in the First Era, a pious tribe of Nedes followed the Tower's guidance to an undersea anomaly, where they built a submerged sanctuary. Millennia later, the edifice and anomaly remain, providing a secure and wondrous escape from the surface world.

I heard that Duke Sebastien was a werewolf so they put him in a cage.
Did you hear that someone purged the corruption from the Wyrd Tree?
Orcs commandeered Malak's Maw, but they were dealt with, thankfully. Orcs make me nervous.
You're the one who rooted out that spy and united the Ebonheart Pact!
Kothringi or not, Drillk returned to the Hist. I don't care what my egg-sisters think.
You showed the Dominion at Murkwater. Burn, milk-suckers, burn! Ha!
All those prisoners in White Rose, driven mad. Sometimes you have to weigh the odds.
I heard that someone found a way into Fort Cradlecrush and defeated the Stormfist leader there.
The Silvenar is crucial to the Dominion's stability. His advisor's sacrifice won't be forgotten.
They say Captain Khammo took another ship. You're why moon-sugar is so pricy, yes?
Did you hear that the Great Shackle was destroyed?
You faced the darkness in combat. You faced the Dro-m'Athra!
You met Sheogorath in Southpoint? What next, Boethiah in Marbruk?
You were involved in that mess at Farangel's Landing, weren't you? Sad business.
I hear old Aphren's Hold is no longer haunted...if that was you, you have my thanks.
I heard that Duke Sebastien was a werewolf, so they killed him.
You helped strengthen the Pact in Stormhold. Thank you.
Have you heard of that Sees-All-Colors? Cannot believe the Fighters Guild let her live.
Seems as if the Pact leaders are preparing to take on the Skald-King's traitorous brother.
My brother joined that Bad Man cult. Word is they're all dead now. I never liked my brother much.
Who did the Hound think he was to steal the Green Lady's sister, Rajhin himself?
Have you heard about the Daggers? They killed an entire flock of harpies with their bare hands. Makes the Fighters Guild look like amatuers.
With the Great Shackle destroyed, has the Planemeld been stopped?
The queen's a strong woman. Glad she's taking care of the city, not some regent.
I saw several Reachmen run north, headed home. May a werewolf devour them before they get there!
I can't believe our troops are climbing the Shrouded Pass. I guess it's the only way to reach the Doomcrag, but I wouldn't want to be up there!
Heard you were the one who saved the king's life...thank you!
You won't see much of Duke Sebastien anymore. He's a werewolf, so they locked him up and threw away the key.
The Muth Gnaar monks use an ancient Daedric artifact to heal. How dare the Vereansu interfere with their holy work.
Even if you hadn't destroyed those shipments, I'm sure the Tribunal would have stopped the plague before it reached Mournhold.
Why did those Wood Orcs think the Covenant could take Velyn Harbor? Madness.
If the Duke were an Orc, he'd have killed himself by now. He brings shame to Evermore.
Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!
Glad to hear Camlorn is safe again. I imagine that it will take years to rebuild it, however.
I love mead. I love Voljar mead. Well, really, I love any mead. I'm not that particular.
Thank you for standing beside the Queen at Tanzelwil, traveler. Stars watch over you.
Trusting a bandit? The Lion Guard should be ashamed of itself.
The Jackdaws should never attacked Haven. They got what they deserved.
I was beginning to think this fight was hopeless, but with the Great Shackle destroyed, we might just have a chance here.
The Reachmen are off-guard. Something's gone wrong with their plans, it seems.
Dathieu? The son of King Ranser's traitor general? Do we really want another Dathieu serving in the army?

I'm part of the Fighter's Guild... I do odd jobs outside the mines. There were far too many cultists for me to face, though. Sometimes the best plan is to live and fight another day.
I heard the hermit in the forest was out trying to talk to the ghosts. I don't know what he's up to, but it can't be good. Who talks to spirits, you know?
It is as I suspected.  Guendeline is with child.  Given her circumstances, I don't know that she'll take well to the news.
Roche and the Wyrd; there's a story there.\n\nAll I know is Roche's son was in Westtry, some months ago.  He came home wounded, and neither Elsie nor the Wyrd could save him.
Oh Isabelle, you look just a mess... and yes, friend, I will return with you, now that we've found my daughter. Just be warned. I did not have my sword before. I have it now. If I see that Lurker, I'm going to cut it apart, piece by bloody piece.
I... I'll try, sir. I guess if you learned to fight those things... maybe I can too. Thank you.
I know it's a town by the will of Godwin alone. I doubt the Magis Order even knows we exist - a blessing and a curse. Granted, we don't have to deal with their iron-handed rule, but we also can't get the protection we need from the Werewolf threat..
It *was*. I don't know what you think you're doing here, but unless you have business with the Lion Guard you'd best leave.
Take this to the victim, administer it as soon as you can.  My poisons are not to be trifled with!
Oh, the Inquisitor sent you? Right then, you'll want to start up by the temple-- you can see it up on the hill there, to the east. There's usually a priest out front, just let him know you're patrolling for us so's he doesn't get worried.
Wha? What're you... talkin' about?\n\n<Braen is having difficulty focusing on you.>
I anticipated the courier's demise.  I will send a group of Magis Order Watchers to transport his body to Westtry.  There they will prepare a ritual which will allow you to communicate with his spirit.
I was just 14 when my parents disappeared. I came looking here for them and then I... forgot.\n\nMother Murk visited often... she brought sweet things. Oh. They were bugs. Ugh, she made us eat bugs!\n\nWhen she left, she went north. Into the lake.
Thank you, but wait a moment before you leave. There's more I must tell you.
What you lack in wisdom you make up for in nerve!\n\nYour meddling in the matter of Elsie Dolban made an enemy of me.  GUARDS!
I've had cows with more energy than he ever showed! At least my daughter will marry a good crofter to take over the farm work.
I'd heard this through my contacts. So the second courier sent you to Countess Virolynn who was attacked by a werewolf.  Did you slay the fell beast?
These are ill times. There's enemies at the gates of Eagle's Watch, and now Crosswych is besieged by werewolves? It is time to put this new alliance to the test. Give this missive to Godwin. It will allow him to request help from Fahara'jad himself.
Aldcroft's a good town. Small, but it has everything anyone needs. Traders pass through regularly, so our shops are usually well-stocked.
I'm not missing, I'm perfectly fine! Just need to open this chest of drawers and they won't budge. Can you give me a hand?
This... this is my family ring. It belongs to my brother. He will be elated to receive it. Please, take this to him. He is right over there guarding the camp. You have my thanks!
Overrun by werewolves, or overrun by men, we'll take her back. The only difference between fur and skin is they smell different when they burn.
Angof is our next stop after we liberate Camlorn. We've already got a camp near his hold out in Cath Bedraud.
Cath Bedraud? Bretons have been buried there for centuries. Even their kings and queens are interred there.\n\nOnce, it was a beautiful place, but now you can't go anywhere near it. It's too dangerous. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't go there.
Skorvild the Smithy says my boy Etienne broke into his forge. \n\nHe claims my boy stole his tools and wrecked the place. I know it wasn't him. He's a good boy!\n\nI saw the footprints, though. It was someone's child... but whose?
To the north of here, along the beach. Crazed lady trying to plunder riches of the dead. She's wild as can be.\n\nI'd stay away from her if I were you. Something is not... right with her.
Eccentricity is tolerated, but I fear Hainen has quite lost his wits. He is said to be attempting to create an Imago Serry by turning living people to stone. What madness! To think my wise teacher could fall so far....
I am an Exemplar, the embodiment of the power and glory of the constellations. However, I am but one piece in the grand orchestra.
From what Inwold said, the coven member who was to sacrifice him was named Sister Agnes. The other coven members may not know she's dead.\n\nI'll stay here for a bit. If you bring me the robe of a coven member, I can spell it to disguise you as Agnes.
We had split up to fix various machines. I was watching the lift in the center when I heard some kind of loud gong, and then the constructs activated. I ran back here to try and get help, but I'm cut off from my team.
Who can say? What with this civil war and all, maybe people don't care as much about cleanliness as they used to.\n\nI'm just trying to make ends meet, and economics was never my strong point.
No! He wasn't my husband. Not any more. He was a monster! He came back from Northpoint, and the next morning he … changed. There was rage in his eyes. Madness.\n\nHe was an animal and I had to put him down. May the Divines forgive me!
Maybe you're right. Her hunger was growing. It was endless, boundless. Who knows where that might have led?\n\nI'll go back. Just let me have a few last moments with her.
Where would we be without our fishing boats? Irne Guylitte down at the docks says someone's been destroying them. Maybe he's doing the destruction himself...
You're right. This doesn't make any sense at all.  My duty is to do what's right, not to blindly follow orders.\n\nI'm with you.
We sent a caravan to Omaynia a few days ago, and Orvona believes it carried more of these blighted slaves.\n\nI have no doubt they succumbed to the Blight soon after. They couldn't have made it much farther than Marshmine, if you wish to find them.
They're as pale as the moon. Some say the lunaria flower speaks of a night with one's true love beneath the stars.\n\nI say they're not worth the trouble. After the blossoms are plucked, they die as quickly as a man's interest.
I hate lunaria above all else.\n\nSee how the blossoms are already turning brown? They don't last. It's a waste to pick them.  \n\nHow could Ra'ud ignore my wishes? Tell Ra'ud I'll never speak to him again.
How interesting that Ra'ud would present me with a bouquet of acanthe.\n\nI hate acanthe. Its scent is like rotting flesh.\n\nHow could Ra'ud ignore my wishes? Tell Ra'ud I'll never speak to him again.
A cave the east of the Refuge. The Bosmer bury people in it.\n\nBetween you and me, I seen Imperials taking bones out of there and carrying them south into Haven town. I can't figure what they want with them.
Leather from beasts. Pliable armor. Restoration potions, go down easy. \n\nWell? Join up?
What?! I've already paid him twice this week!\n\nI mean, uh, he's joking of course. Paying a guard would be... illegal!\n\nBut now that you mention it, I've brought him a present from my travels. Could you bring this to him... discreetly?
What? Why would she ask you to do that...?\n\nOh. Oh, no. Not my sweet Ferema. Friend, though my heart breaks, I thank you for telling me this.
They do, do they?\n\nI should have seen this coming.  I have no wish to make an enemy of House Dres - particularly given their popularity here - but my loyalty is to my customers.\n\nI buy the best goods at the best price.  That won't change.
Oh dear.\n\nAre you saying someone will... you are saying they will, aren't you?  Oh, my.  \n\nWell, if you put it that way, I suppose I have no choice.  How unfortuante.  All right.  All right.
It's deep under the bridge on the road to Othrenis.  \n\nXzzil the Scamp is magnanimous.  For your help, he will not kill you.  Goodbye!
Living champions? Well, you're just in time. They're about to come through that portal!
It's driftwood, outlander. Exempt from the Green Pact. It's not forbidden to build fires, it's forbidden to cut wood for them.
Arkay bless you! Tell Marthe Yvienne how many of us you saved when you leave the Mine.
Good Luck!
I am willing
You certainly are living in one.  The reality is that you're not as smart as you would like to be.  Get lost.
Yes you have a very active imagination.  I bet you're imagining me giving you information right now!  That is not going to happen though.  Go away or I imagine that my blade will find its way into your throat.
My dad and sister are still alive!  I'm afraid the same wont be true for me soon.  The guards have assured that my life will come to an end.\n\nPromise me that you will return to my sister with a message for me?
The portal must be closed. You have to collect the four keys. You have to close the portal.
I'm conducting research into ancient Yokudan ruins to see what light they cast on modern Redguard society. \n\nFascinating, but not without peril—an alchemical experiment led to my assistant becoming, er, incapacitated. But I hope to recover him.
What? That's impossible. I can barely hear your voice over the tumult of battle!\n\nWe wouldn't be at war if the King of Wayrest had honored his vow to marry Princess Rayelle of Shornhelm.\n\nInstead, he cast her aside for a Redguard.\n\nYou should go.
Last I saw Marthe she was up by the barn. Doing her chores.\n\nI just stopped by to help.\n\nIt wasn't a big deal, okay?
Because Lady Vallis hit me.
We need a Regent to rule while the royal family is in such disarray.\n\nThe Minister of War is in prison. The Minister of Health is preoccupied by the dead. The Minister of the Treasury is over-taxing everything.\n\nIt's chaotic.
Shh! This is not the place to discuss such things. If you are what you say you are, you had better talk more softly.\n\nSuppose I am, and I'm not saying I am. Where would I find others of similar temperament?
Every day, gods walk the face of the world: the good and bad Daedra. Lesser races worshiped the weak and feminine "Divines."\n\nThe Dwemer denied their existence. They were atheists in a land of gods. They only considered their own intellect sacred.
So what item are you interested in?
<These papers consist of several repeated signatures, namely Deputy Felisa and House Sister Baylan.>\n\n<The signatures themselves start off crude, but eventually take on a more elegant appearance.>
It was a nightmare! These savage men burst into the seraglio. They struck down the guards and even sweet little Roheebah … and then they took the prince!\n\nPlease … could you, would you go after them? You have to.
My fellows have gone completely mad! It started as unusually short tempers, then exploded into fights and killing. Many of us fled, but then bandits came and killed or captured the survivors.\n\nI don't know which is worse!
You put red powder into the brazier and it starts to burn.
You put black powder into the brazier and it starts to burn.
<The scent of the perfume lingers still upon the pages of the scroll. The contents of the note read:\n\n"We're running out of food. The forest is keeping all of our resources away. What should we do?"\n\nThere is a response, but the page is torn.>
There's a vial of poison over there, next to the candles. I can recognize its foul stench from here. Bring it to me.\n\nAnd thank you. I couldn't really ask Gerard to do this, no matter how necessary.
Pfui. I'll just say you wrote it yourself. \n\nIt's my word against yours, and I'm a Breton nobleman. Don't waste my time.
There's no need for hostility... I apologize if I've wasted any of your time.\n\nThey've taken over a burnt-out farmstead between Aphren's Hold and Wayrest.
"And it was in this day that the Slave-Queen did arise, she who we name Saint Alessia, also called Al-Esh, also known as Perrif.\n\nFrom thralldom was she born into a life of subjugation, surrounded by a world of abject misery."
Excellent point! All right, here you go. \n\nUse them wisely. Anything that might be a thorn in the side of the Supernal Dreamers is a good plan to me.
"This is my confession.\n\n"As a novice of the Maruhkati Selective, I watched helplessly as the glory of my order was crushed under the heel of Imperial interests."
Hmm. I guess you're right. All right, I'll come out for a peek, and if it's clear, we can make a run for it. But you'd better protect me!
Since then, I've been dreaming while I'm awake. I dream about teeth and blood. So much blood!\n\nI can smell it all around me. And I'm hungry … so hungry.
Sorry hero, you're too late to save the day this time. Look around. The farm is in ashes.\n\nMy daughter Ganise and I stayed only to search for my husband, but at this point, I think we have to assume he was killed in the fire.
The Princess? She is all right then … that is good. King Fahara'jad sent me to protect her, but there is little I can do from out here. \n\nI do not wish to start a war, but I will if my king orders it. I await new orders even now.
I cannot defy the Duke's orders—not with an army at the gates. You can. \n\nOne thing that might help—Sir Gregory is insanely jealous of his wife. In his mind, she would be the sheath to every knight's blade. \n\nYou didn't hear it from me.
Bad luck. Could've just blown by Koeglin, but thought to stop for extra supplies. \n\nWho would guess the lighthouse was out? Hit a rock—didn't sink me, but hurt the hull.\n\nNow I gotta wait for repairs.
Stendarr is the god of mercy. Any who undertake a life of war or adventure should be familiar with him and what he stands for.\n\nMercy is not an act of weakness. Rather, it is an act of strength to rise above our greatest inner turmoils.
The prisoners have already been released. You may find they've been roughed up a bit. We are … enthusiastic.\n\nThere's one rather stubborn fellow who refuses to go until he's spoken to you. He insists on knowing if you're safe.
Roy? Where is he? Why did he send a stranger in his place?
And my thanks to you. But there's someone else who'd like to thank you. \n\nHis Majesty wants to speak to you. Go on.
It was a monster! It tore out Guillaume's throat and disappeared into the river. It was hideous!
Faolchu died a long, long time ago. He was summoned back from the dead. I want to find out who to blame for that. You can read the history of a werewolf's sire from the blood of his offspring. \n\nThat's why we need to capture a werewolf.
I guess. I liked Roy. He watched out for the merchants around here. And, in exchange, we helped Roy.\n\nI listened and let Roy know what people were saying. If we ever told him something important, Roy made sure the right people were informed.
The foulest criminals are executed and disposed of here.\n\nFor many generations, it's been the duty of the Ash'abah to maintain the Tear's defenses. We protect unconsecrated bodies from necromancy.
Casnar? That's a … sore subject. Believe it or not, he's actually getting married today. \n\nShould be at the wedding right now. I know. I know. I should be there, but I'm not.
Splendid! Cut me loose! You may think you defeated Faolchu, but his influence spreads like wildfire.\n\nSomething's not right in Aldcroft.
Sir Granden was a great hero of High Rock. Standing alone in the pass to Stormhaven, he turned back the raging Nord invaders. \n\nAs the first spirit to fall to the Bloodthorns, he will be a fearsome opponent.
Seems likely. We don't know how the Nameless Soldier defeated Faolchu yet, but we're determined to figure it out.
Yes. I can see that now. A wise man passed through here not long ago.\n\nHe foresaw all of this, and he warned me, the desert is the kingdom of death by divine right. We cannot change that.
Red Rooks, they call themselves.\n\nIt's a shame, really. Most of them used to be good and regular folk from all across Glenumbra. These trying times have turned them to banditry. Watch your step around them, stranger.
Are we all right? Soldiers have invaded our farm and you're asking if we're all right?\n\nWhat is this? Some kind of trick so you can take our house, too?
Daggerfall is the jewel of Breton cities. It's the home of House Deleyn. Each son is a more worthy king than the last. \n\nWhy do you think they call our alliance the Daggerfall Covenant, after all?
I can't enter the vault, so listen well. There are two crowns inside, but you may take only one. One is King Anton's jeweled crown. The other bears the curse that binds me here. \n\nI want you to take the cursed crown.
A valid strategy, one that has certainly felled even the most powerful mage. Yet what would it have proven?\n\nThe mage made no claim he could defeat any bow. He said only that his power was a match for the sword. Look deeper.
That is what you must discover. <<1>>'s legend is known by all, even the serving folk. Direct your questions to them—<<2>>, <<3>>, and <<4>>.\n\nOnce you know what they know, return to me and give your answer.
<This tile depicts the constellation called The Atronach.>
Flame stalks! Tasty treats. They help with indigestion … for a lizard at least.\n\nYou're not a lizard. What do you need them for? For some spell with Gabrielle I bet, and she doesn't even like lizards ….\n\nOh well. Just take them, but she owes me!
She is in seclusion in her chambers, mourning the loss of her husband, the king.\n\nHer daughter and son have both fallen to misfortune as well. We pray for our queen in these hard times.
Well, Tu'whacca tells me that you must do battle with the spirits of the long-dead giant Goblinkin. To what end? I do not know. But only fools doubt Tu'whacca's wisdom.
Yes. Sir Lanis and his knights volunteered to come with me, but I only see Dame Alexine. \n\nThere must have been too many of us for the binding stone. This isn't good. The other knights could have been scattered throughout the crypts.
I'll head out as soon as I see a clear path.\n\nA word of warning, though. The lurcher in the chamber ahead is extremely tough. I'd keep it away from the totems surrounding it if you plan to challenge it.
He is a good friend, but he thought this fate business was all nonsense.\n\nThe woman had prescribed his fate as well, but he did not believe it. Nonetheless, I believe he did go into the desert to see. Perhaps you should seek him out.
It's his own sword. I shouldn't have left him alone.\n\nPlease, look around to see if there are any traces of his killer!
That seems unlikely, unless they are in truly dire straits.\n\nYou've piqued my curiosity. Where did you get this information?
The Imperial commander, <<1>>, tortured me. He broke something in my hand and wrist, and I told him where to find the others.\n\nI put my comfort over theirs. <<2>> heard me, and she'll never forget.
So that's where all the food was coming from! No wonder they wanted to keep things quiet.\n\nI'd better keep this information to myself, or there'll be an uproar. I just hope they know what they're doing.
Good for you. I don't. You know what I want? I want to go home. \n\nI want to meet my wife at the door, yell at the kids for knocking things over, and sit down to a warm dinner with a cold ale.\n\nThink you could arrange that, you Covenant turd?
There's so much of it! Layers of metal plates that weigh as much as the warriors who bear it. You can't feel the wind on your skin or in your hair.\n\nThat's how they think. Heavy, ponderous, obsessed with defense. That is not how warriors fight!
It is a town southwest of here. To our shame, it was occupied by the Imperials - dogs and sons of dogs!\n\nBut they do not hold it happily. Our cities are roses - fair to behold, but if you clutch them you taste only their thorns.
<<<1>> begins to stir.>
Darien? Know him? Not really. Well ….\n\nOh, all right! I know him. Darien and I were once … that is … I've spent some time with him. Before. In the past. Way, way past. If you see him … oh, never mind. What's that look for?
What kind?
I wish I knew. I followed the knights in here without thinking. My guards started gasping and falling to the ground, just like the knights. But not me.\n\nThese are the only survivors, but I don't think they'll last much longer.
Excellent! Welcome to the guild, novice! \n\nI can almost guarantee no one will steal your soul and use it to fuel a mystic rite. Almost.
It's out of the way and makes a great base of operations. They can signal their ships from the tower.\n\nUnless our luck changes quickly, they can use the tower to launch a full-scale invasion of Glenumbra!
The Fell's Brigade has turned against us? That makes a certain amount of sense, but the news is still distressing.\n\nI'll talk to the mayor about this. In the meantime, I have something else I need you to do.
You can't buy one, if that's what you're asking.\n\nThe best place to find one is on an Imperial. Sometimes we're lucky enough to kill one without getting obvious rips or bloodstains on their uniforms.
Lately, mostly harpies. They live in the crags along the coast, but something has stirred them up. They've been attacking travelers—even within sight of Daggerfall's walls. Be careful if you head that way. And leave your family somewhere safe.
We were betrayed. An army doesn't simply sneak in and overtake a Redguard city like <<1>> without inside help.\n\nSomeone ensured their journey's secrecy and opened our gates for them while we slept.
We have two. The first is our own Captain of the Guard, Dhakir.\n\nI refuse to accept that no one saw these Imperials. No alarms were sounded. The gates were left unattended. The failure is obvious. We just need evidence to prove it.
I'll rally my soldiers and lead them to the Coral Heart chamber. She must be inside.\n\nHave you seen my aide, Sings-With-Reed? She knows more about the coral than anyone. She must have some kind of plan.
Yes, outsider. \n\nOther than Khralek, you're the first person I've spoken to since … the beheading.
Victory? Sometimes the living can't see that the costs are too high. The giant destroyed us as well as our enemies, and what use is our domain if it is but charred earth?\n\nIn death, the only thing I want is to be alive.
Bala? Bala … ah, yes, the Ashlander! You remember her, don't you dear?\n\nMy performance must have been quite convincing.
And I will enjoy watching you fumble and fail!\n\nGo back to my sister and tell her of her thin-scaled mate's failure. Vara-Zeen was never worthy to lead the village. He couldn't stop me and he was never worthy of my sister!
He fears vengeance for all he's done, and he's right to be afraid. But he forgets the power of the Hist. I believe we can use the Hist to force him to return. \n\nPerhaps that is why he took the branch and gave it to the Khajiit in the first place.
Speak quickly, I feel my life falling away from me.
Oh, thank you! \n\nQuickly, where is his tomb?
He's an important person in Narsis. A writer. Writes all day. Writes all night.\n\nBut don't touch his journal. He can get frightfully angry.
Day 32 \n\nThe substance isn't strong enough when added to water. The solution becomes diluted, and most of the effective properties fade. Until we can formulate a stronger version, we need to look for other ways to spread the plague.
The warm-blood was sent by those who honor and protect this Vale. Most curious.
He will remain in the Vale, serving the Ghost Snake.
I hope so. We only have so many people willing to sacrifice themselves for our cause.\n\nTake the whistle. Same plan as before. Blow it, grab the weapons, get out.
This doesn't look good. There must be a reason why Giron wanted Narsis sealed and why he wanted you dead. Get back there and find out.
They were mixing the Llodos substance with the corpses. The plague festered in them. They were bled into our water supply!\n\nThat's why Giron didn't want us to leave! He wanted to infect us all!
I had to do it. They were changing. \n\nYou think I'm mad? See for yourself. I was in the cellar of that stable. It leapt into one of my troops, and I trapped it down there. Go in and introduce yourself.
Burn the flowers at each shrine. They're a rare variety of gold kanet called "Roland's Tears" and are sacred to the Three.\n\nI pray they hear you.
The sermons of Vivec are beside every bed. Vivec's psalms are sighed from every maiden's lips. His wisdom makes his people as hard, capable, and enduring as the Poet himself. \n\nAll know Vivec, for Vivec would have it so.
Commoners would call it a scrying spell, but I'm beyond such crude hedge magic. It will enable me to see and hear what you do. Furthermore, I'll be able to "speak" to you.
So that silly fool sent you for my Woozle? You can have my Woozle when you defeat me in one-on-one personal combat. Think you can do that?
Decades ago, the Knahaten flu swept through the land. The children were first. By Z'en, I can still see the bodies ….\n\nBut Z'en couldn't save us. So at <<1>>'s behest, I prayed to Clavicus Vile. He bestowed this mockery of salvation upon us.
Eroni … my Eroni … she's gone, I know that. But when I saw her enter our home, I had to find out how she'd returned. That's when she stabbed me.\n\nIf that Argonian hadn't leapt between us, she'd have finished me off.
"Entry 442: Just watched <<1>> enter her home. This isn't right. Her body remains at the mortuary.\n\n"Going to see what this creature wants, and why it wears <<1>>'s face."
"Everyone take heart! Qa'tesh will set fires, and Ra-shadda will summon spirits to create chaos. Unjasi will bring the prisoners here.\n\n"Meet J'kur in the pumpkin patch by the stables. Until then, be brave and think of home."
Then come aboard, and I shall ferry you there.
I did what I was told. \n\nMagistrix Vox gives orders, not reasons. She supplied the rod to control the constructs, but it malfunctioned during the ambush. After that, the spiders attacked everything!
They serve the Ghost Snake and protect the vale from poachers and predators. The snakes that dwell in the vale are special.
I would have him give up this folly and rejoin us. We should live in peace, far from the housemen. If he won't listen to me, I'll have to step away from his side.\n\nSo understand me, outlander. If I must order Ziddak's death, I've failed.
If it were up to me, Raston would have quietly disappeared the first night he arrived here. But you're the one making the decision, not me.
Come to learn, recruit? Runecrafting is an ancient and serious art. We manipulate magicka, imbuing it into runes, jewels, and staves. \n\nWe can even transform a common robe into a source of power.
Her voice commands the lost souls, so that's a likely reason. I weep for the other travelers who fell prey to her traps.\n\nYou should leave our cursed gravesite while you still can.
The Kothringi settled around an Ayleid ruin. \n\nWe heard all the villagers were killed by the Knahaten flu, but there's one survivor.
I think most of them were captured. I saw some of them dragged off toward that cave to the north. \n\nI'll report to Diiril and let him know what's happening here. You go to the cave and see if you can find the others.
The general and his brother will die—the power they receive will consume them. But they will be reborn, more fearsome than even the mightiest horde of Nede warriors. \n\nWe, the Chimer, will win this day.
I will follow. The map will show the way.\n\nThese symbols are two landmarks. Find them, and we will know where the treasure lies.
Tastes-the-Breeze and I had an egg-daughter. Eyes-that-Glint.\n\nThe Voleks worked her to death. Their own daughter must pay for that crime!
Did she, now? I suppose I can spare one of my scouts.\n\nTell me what you need. Do you prefer someone good with a bow or good with a blade?
They're relics that tap into <<1>>'s power. Anyone who controls all the keystones and <<1>> itself would become nearly unstoppable.\n\nObviously, it would be disastrous if the Dominion got them.
That is a top-notch cultural relic—a Heart of the Wild! \n\nTake it to the monastery called Muth Gnaar. Give it to monks as offering, but make sure to get a good Dark Elf relic in return.
Sep teaches us to be patient, and so I am.
Daedra, down in the caldera. We tried to push past them. \n\nWe failed. I'm lucky to be alive.
Let me absorb your strength, combine it with my own. Have no fear. You won't die, but you will become part of something greater than yourself. \n\nHold still while I strike you with the Judgment. Strike you—and make you immortal!
Yes. We called in several favors to do it, but we've cracked her code.\n\n<<1>> was after something hidden in a Dwarven ruin. A place known as <<2>>.
It's more than sap, it is the Hist tree's soul.\n\nWhen an Argonian is created, it is said the sap becomes the Argonian's blood … its essence … its spirit.
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.\n\nAll I can tell you is I swore to guard those chests with my life. That ought to give you some idea of their importance.
Threats and menace, threats and menace. Here, take the uniform, and leave poor Kaasha to her bondage.
My memory fades, thank S'rendarr.\n\nI remember fear, rage, and pain … and then relief.
Well hello there.  This is the QA conversation, are you able to read this?
No, not you—your spider. You'd just ruin the parts prying them out.\n\nGo beat some spiders into submission, then have your sparky friend collect their parts. I'll wait for you by the emitter at the other end of the chamber.
Comrade, grab that book and her notes on the table. I saw her scribbling after speaking to her master. We may be able to learn more about this plot, learn what this "Mortuum Vivicus" is. \n\nGrab them. Then let's get out of here.
Molag Bal! May he burn in the glare of a thousand suns!\n\nIt's just like him to send an assassin to kill a noble warrior. That's a coward's weapon.
I had to say farewell. The honor of my House has been restored, Stonefalls is safe, and soon, Garyn and I will be side by side.\n\nMay the Three watch over you.
<<1>> fears for his life. He's surrounded himself with guards and hides behind lock and key.\n\nYou'll find him in the basement of his house, but you'll need a key to enter. I'd search his house for the key.
That'll do. Urp!
On the slope of the volcano to the southeast.
I don't know as much as <<1>>, but just look at these ruins! Xanmeers, the Argonians call them. \n\nThe lizards' ruins go way back, and this one's old, real old. Anything from that time must be valuable … I mean, significant.
There, you see? You've pre-qualified by wealth. This invitation has your name on it.\n\nOr it will, once you add it.
Ruh-roh!
Woof! Bark! Woof!
More of the same, Plenty of drinking, Valen singing his song, Hectur bashing him for it, Suron picking fights with just any Nord who comes here. I don't know what it is about those guys and Nords, but when they get smashed, they really get smashed!
I thought so. And here we stand like stupid milk drinkers, waiting for them. \n\nNothing for it. We'll just have to kill them all. You ready?
You believe that? But, my Tiril ….\n\nEnough. Enough death.
An instructor said one of these shadow clucks has a magic amulet. Ate it, probably.\n\nI'm supposed to use this wand to focus my magic on the clucks and find the amulet.
You're right. My assistant believes we can cleanse the eggs that were exposed to bloodshed. I pray she is correct.\n\nThank you. My work beckons.
Truly? What happened? Were the ruins infested with undead? Stendarr's wrath would have served you in good stead.
I've heard word that <<1>> docked his ship in Davon's Watch a few days ago.\n\nYou'll need to disguise yourself to get on the boat. If you can cause a commotion, you can steal an outfit from one of the sailors at the bar on the docks.
Heh, Aelif would have hoped you'd notice by now. This one loves to fight. Loves the thrill of combat. But a thorny puzzle, a tricky lock, a track to follow in the woods? Just as much fun as a blade in a brawl.
Well, how else could I get it tested? Be reasonable.
<You find another dead pilgrim. Her throat was cleanly cut with a blade, and from the damage to her body she clearly fell from the nearby cliff. Like the others, her body is still warm.>
Such glitter and gleam! Such twinkle and shine! We thank you for your tribute, featherless.\n\nOur duke will want to speak with you. Go! Present yourself to the duke for your reward while I add these glitteries to our hoard.
Where's the sport in that? Tell you what. I'll give you one book in exchange for your heart or lungs. Your choice.\n\nNo, wait. I have a better idea! Let's have a contest. A contest, wrapped in a mystery, with an enigma glaze! Oh, what fun we'll have!
Not sure. \n\nWhy don't you fiddle with the prisms while I think this through? Maybe you'll get lucky.
Nightmares. What are you talking about? I'm hiding from the Dominion army. Don't you see them encamped just ahead?
They're antiques, of course! Highly collectible! Also, magic.
It's a faux-shanty shack. I wouldn't expect a commoner like you to understand.
Great work!
Absolutely. I think. You're much less alive than you were a few minutes ago, anyway.\n\nThat should get you through the shroud.
Of course. I don't like being trapped.\n\nWe fled the recent invasion. We thought these ruins were abandoned and secure. We were wrong. They're here, consorting with the dead.
They say lamias can talk, if they wish it. From what I've seen, they're little more than beasts.\n\nPlease restore what's missing to the bodies. I'll guide their spirits back to the Hist.
Our brother's thoughts roil like thunderheads, yet we do not understand. He says the vicecanons shed their skins like water snakes to hide their intentions! Where is the truth in that?
He drinks too much, fights too much, and doesn't have the sense Kyne gave a horker. He's the best cook on the island, though.\n\nSince Father died fighting the Akaviri, we've only had each other.
No. We're having old friends for supper. Drink some roots. Stay with us! You'll be safe here.
So?
Quick, come inside! We've almost made it past the scamps. I heard them say the portal is just beyond.
<<1>> fears for his life. He's surrounded himself with guards and hides behind lock and key.\n\nYou'll find him in the basement of his house, but you'll need a key to enter. I'd search his house for the key.
If you want to get <<1>> by himself you may need to create a distraction.\n\nExtinguishing a torch will draw a guard from his path and releasing a rat or throwing flashpowder into a fire will distract multiple guards.
Thank you, friend. \n\nOnce you've dealt with the bandits and sent Seyne back here, see who else you can find.
I suspect we find and remove whatever afflicts the Hist. I'm embarrassed to say I have no idea how.\n\nBefore your arrival, I found myself wracked with pain. Now, all is calm. The Hist's subtle way of indicating you should lead, yes?
When you quickened our dream, we knew her great purpose and sent her beyond the dream. But you … we could not send you just yet.\n\nYou healed the wounds inflicted by the flesh-walker <<1>>, small one. The Hist shall dream of you, always.
If you find <<1>>'s regiment, you'll find him. Tell him to call off his attack before the Dominion picks him apart. He shouldn't throw away his soldiers for what little remains of our forces.
My mood is terrified, horrified. Isn't that great?
We're used to taking contracts as they come. We pick our own jobs.\n\nThe guildmaster, though … she wanted us to go hunt Daedra. If only we had followed orders ….
Come back when you're ready to aid the Pact.
Kyne blesses the Nords before battle, but Nords die every day. We lose sons and daughters in these stupid wars. And what does mighty Kyne do? Absolutely nothing!\n\nWe refuse to worship a god who ignores us and lets our children die.
Is that how you address your master?\n\nYou're a slave! If you look at Feyne again, I'll put your eyes out. Do you understand?
No, you couldn't understand. Only those who have communed with the Hist understand.\n\nSo I will tell you this: In your travels, seek out Shadowfen. Our people there can help you understand.
They are trees. They grow only in the depths of Black Marsh, our ancestral lands.\n\nWe hold them sacred. Those who would harm them meet our wrath. You do not need to know more.
These are troubled times for Eastmarch. We hear that the Orcs grow more and more aggressive, and there are rumors that disenfranchised Nord clans plan to start a civil war.\n\nAnything could have provoked the giants.
That's the most rational thing I've heard all day.\n\nHold on. I'll unlock the door. Don't let any of the witches follow you in.
Explore the shrine. The witches there might have a clue.\n\nThere's also a locked dresser by the bed. One of the bewitched soldiers might have a key. I'd love to know what they've locked in there.
You picked a bad time to visit Voljar's Meadery, friend. It used to make the sweetest mead you ever tasted. But that was before the Orcthane's thugs showed up demanding free mead.\n\nTheir leader got angry and lost control. He killed the Voljar family.
No. My mother is the head Keeper at Kynesgrove. She'd never turn against Kyne and her people. She should honor my brother's memory, not disgrace it.
War has wounded this land. Now it is our turn to sacrifice, so the plain can heal. \n\nMy students understand this and are willing.
Thanks. I'll see you there.
Yes. In wartime we decry the hated enemy. We call men monsters to steel ourselves for battle.\n\nIt dries my scales to hear that they would act as monsters, as well.
You truly don't know?\n\nYou must know about House Indoril. They're one of the most powerful noble families in all Morrowind. Tanval is the grandmaster of the House, the leader of the entire clan.
It's not exactly a secret, is it? The hills are now littered with survivors from Silaseli, all pulling in my alms from sympathetic travellers, leaving me with scraps.
Yes! It used to just be me and ill-fit for service act. Now I've got to contend with all of these Silaseli survivors who, in addition to being downtrodden war refugees, have the survivor-of-a-necromantic-plot pity going for them.
Well, some of the locals can be friendly and attentive. Idesa is always ready for a good time. I think she may be a bit more serious about our relationship than I am, however.\n\nNo matter. She's good for a bit more entertainment before I move on.
Because we who rule Ebonheart are of House Dres. We are not well loved, even by other Dunmer.\n\nI need you to visit the Argonians, Nords, and Dunmer of <<1>>. Convince them to work together before the Covenant attacks.
If you're looking to take out enemy soldiers directly, your best bet is to use a catapult. They have the largest damage area. Nice for hitting a moving target.
Only what the legends say. It happened long ago, when we were … different. \n\nYou see, before we had the Tribunal to guide and protect us, we were Chimer. We were just another group of Elves.
No. Layers of magical protection engulf the interred. Any Stormfist that tried to even touch my body would have been obliterated. Only those of royal blood could have—No!
Well, you're a smart one, here's a question even you can handle. How does someone normally unlock a locked door? \n\nDon't hurt youself trying to answer, I'll tell you: with a key. I suspect it'ss in the house somewhere. So find it.
Yes. We have several of our best scouts searching the area.\n\nThane Mera found something in the hills, north of here. Those Dragonshrines are rife with passages and secret entrances.
Excellent. What have you decided?
Listen! Take the essence of the Silvenar. Guard it. Keep it safe. The Green Lady must unite with the Silvenar as always. Find the Green Lady, and save her as you saved the Silvenar.\n\nThe Hound calls me. I cannot resist!
When the Silvenar and the Green Lady unite, they forge a connection to the Bosmer and Valenwood, empowering <<Ac:1>>.\n\nSome say it was crafted by the first Silvenar. So our stories tell, which in turn makes it true!
Berj and the workers want meat! Seared, salted, and still bleeding! I ask you, what goes better with a cask of mead than a good bear steak? Nothing, that's what!\n\nHeggvir probably wants to make that fancy goat stew of hers. She uses herbs.
Not sure I'd phrase it that way, but yes. We've been through so much. I'd be mad as Sheogorath if I wanted to turn things out like this.\n\nBut it's good to be back.
Wherever the forces of evil prey upon the innocent, wherever souls are stolen and bodies shriven, wherever a people cry out for justice, there goest I! \n\nI mean, this whole eternal servitude business is rather nasty, don't you agree?
Yep. Boots is the best kind of hunting partner: he's deadly and quick, and he keeps his mouth shut.\n\nWe're hoping to stalk some big game in Deshaan. Right, Boots?
<<1>>'s husband, <<2>>, headed out with <<3>> and <<4>>.\n\nI've prayed more would help find <<1>>, but we've seen both werewolves and Houndsmen near.
Hah! I know you can't; the totem is fully charged! You're not as much of a pushover as I first thought. Look for me again soon. Maybe I'll give you a hand.\n\nBut you still need to find <<1>>. I don't know what she's cooking up!
Oh, it's not just you. Others have tried to help Valeric. They either see how futile their task is or they fail.\n\nMy master wants to explain this to you. You don't have to make any decisions right now. Just hear him out.
May the Eight watch over you anyway, you miserly milk drinker.
Valeric opposes me because I embrace my true nature. I take what is mine without thought or hesitation.\n\nValeric questions everything and tries to fix our people. He deprives them of what they need to survive while telling them there is a better way.
Shield your eyes! If the acid splashes upon you, all would weep.\n\nBehold, your path is clear!
There's still some tension. The Prince made accusations when the King was poisoned, and that certainly hasn't helped matters.\n\nTo his credit, though, Prince Irnskar seeks to make amends for the strained relations.
I can only assume you were sacrificed. I don't know why you weren't immediately consumed. The souls of the living are like mead and bread to this thing.
Just give the word, and I'll follow.
The Dreamwalker was most likely injured by the blast of magic. He was the last chance we had. Your king can't do this on his own.
Thank Y'ffre, he's alive then!\n\nWe could've beat the Drublog ambushers, but they brought in a creature. Huge. Ugly. Nothing we did hurt it.
The Wolf is sly and observant. Ferocious and deadly. She watches and waits for the best opportunity to strike. With her aid, our eyes see the hidden weaknesses of our foes.\n\nIf you seek the weakness in your enemy's armor, call upon the Wolf.
I'll be a thrall, under his command. I can feel the pull of his will already.\n\nSoon I'll be your enemy. If you defeat me, I'll be free. If you fail, he'll take both our souls. Try not to fail.
Earlier, when we were running through the compound, I noticed four rays of light coming from the towers surrounding the main building. I think those are coming from the binding stones. We need to disrupt them to stop the ritual.
Do I look like I'm getting on well? I bet you still have a house with a stout door to lock.
Don't rush me. Better yet, make yourself useful.\n\nBring me the Varla Stone tincture from over there. And be careful with it! It is rare and rather unstable.
I'll take that and burn it. We've had enough trouble with Fildgor and his followers to last a lifetime. \n\nThanks for intercepting this.
She's in her home, and hardly noticed us.\n\nShe lives in the past, seeing patterns of ancient times replaying today.
What's it matter to you? Have business with the King, do you?\n\nThen stand in line with the rest of the peasants. Seems like every alley-rat decided to show up and whine about something when they heard the King was coming. But he's not here for that.
Well, I had the men gather table scraps from the mess. There's no food in that mine. The Goblins will be starving.\n\nThrow scraps at them, and they'll go mad for it. They might even fight over it. That's better than them eating my miners.
It's too late to help Darkwater, but not to reclaim our honor.\n\nA deal then. If you remove the head of the large troll we call Death-In-Winter and bring it to me, I will consider returning to Irnskar's meeting. For the King.
Yes. The clan's blood is ablaze.\n\nI'm afraid if we give them time to regroup, they'll attack the farm. I saw the chieftain rallying the warriors and their mammoths.
Fine! Have it your way! It activates some sort of mechanism. This cage is some kind of sacrificial device.\n\nI beg you, whatever you do, leave the right switch alone!
I'm bored now. Run along.
Sure as Sheogorath's a madman. Back before the Pact was formed, Unnvald raided all along the Morrowind coast. His crew always came back laden with gold and honor.
Aye, but almost no one uses this pass anymore. Merchants ship cargo from Ebonheart to Windhelm, and then make the trip down to Riften.
Perhaps. That is for them to decide. But at least they have that choice.\n\nLike King Jorunn, you demonstrate honor. I will return to the Prince's meeting and hear what he has to say. You have earned that much.
It's a Dunmer city, built on an Argonian village, built on an Ayleid ruin. Confused, like much of Shadowfen.\n\nConsider it a last bastion of civilization before Black Marsh. Everything south of Stormhold is lizards and mud.
Fildgor plays dirty. I wish I could help more, but I've already overstepped the limits of my contract. I need to get back to Mournhold. A new matter involving a rival group has become an issue.\n\nBut these people still need your help, hero.
Thank Kyne you're back! While everyone was fighting off the attack, Thorulf raised a skeleton in the manor. He told grandfather the undead had broken in, that we were all going to die.
I don't know what they're looking for, but the bastards are all over the mine. They've slaughtered most of my miners. I think a few are still alive, held captive. Find them and free them, if you can!
That would be ideal, mortal. They threaten the stories of a hundred lifetimes.
There's nothing holding her together. Any moment, she could just disappear.\n\nI couldn't stop them before, but now … I know what I must do.
No, please, get away! Who—it's you. Don't look at me. Don't touch me. The bastards, the Hagravens, they took my eyes! Sucked them out of my skull! I can't … what they did to me!\n\nMake them pay—kill them, rip their eyes out!
I've got a gut wound, and I'm losing blood. Aside from that, I'm doing just fine.
For a friend, anything. One of the guards hates cats. Earlier, I saw a cat run into the building. The guard chased it for an hour.\n\nBring a cat with you. It might prove useful. I saw a bunch of them following the Argonians around. Try over there.
The quarantine will not hold. It's only a matter of time before the city's water supply is tainted, and Narsis is ravaged by the Llodos plague. My people are not infected, and I've vowed to keep them safe.
None whatsoever. And I wish the burrowers had never broken through. This is nothing but trouble.\n\nOh, I admit, it looks kind of pretty in there. But no miner's going to want to work in a pit that's infested by rolling buzzsaws.
Ah, my friend. You misunderstand! You will be the courier.\n\nMy children stole the body as soon as you left. It lies upstairs. Let's see if his uniform fits you.
I am connected to the spirits of this world. Specifically, I have a bond with the spirit of the wolf. This bond has existed my entire life, even when I was a small child.\n\nWhen the spirits called to me, I left my home to seek them out.
Then it could be anywhere! This is an insult. To me, my family! We've brewed rotmeth for centuries!
Not at all. It's supposed to stand still and keep things cool. But now it's creaking around, taking a swing at anything warmer than an icicle.\n\nI can hunt well enough, but atronachs aren't my usual game.
No time to talk about that now. I know exactly who you met. But please, I must try to save this one's life first.\n\nThe present now. Then we can discuss the past.
It's Valaste. She's been working day and night to understand these books. Sheogorath has a warped and twisted mind, and I worry that this work is taking a toll on her.
Of course! This is what we've worked for, all this time. Putting up with the mocking and insults, Sheogorath's poor attempts at humor. We'll recover the isle, and the Guild will have a safe haven from the war!
A big Nord, all in black. Only Nord with them. He never came back down the path. Like as not he's still up there, frozen stiff.
Yes—normal ruins, with no Men or Mer to ravage its plants and animals. \n\nIt's a pact, mortal. We'll do this together.
Yes. Sinmur and the Worm Cult are crushed, but Ysgramor's warning concerns me. What could he mean?\n\nFind <<1>>. He should be outside. I must think on this.
PLACEHOLDER, SHOULD LAUNCH LFG UI
Captain Tendil of the First Auridon Marines. We were sent here at the behest of Her Royal Majesty, Queen Ayrenn.  \n\nWe walked into a trap. Agents of the Veiled Heritance stripped us of our uniforms and gear and left us here to burn.
My assistant Teldur and I were overseeing preparations for the Queen's visit. \n\nI thought it odd that the marines arrived so far ahead of schedule, but decided that fortune favored us. I've never been so wrong.
It burns. It burns from inside out!
Help me. I can't take this anymore.
Strike? My friend, you have learned little from me.\n\nNow we must gather our greatest resource—gold.
Well, I can't offer much, but whatever Eraral wants, he can have. I'd like to get out of this mess with my life and my goods, if at all possible.
As you please. But if you make any effort to free him, I'll take action. Swift, bloody action.
I bet you don't win very much, either. But suit yourself.
To tell the truth, I feared we wouldn't win this fight. The Rift is finally back under Pact control.
I'm not sure. Some sort of artifact, certainly. It was used by an overzealous cult leader to end his life—and the lives of dozens of others.\n\nThe spirits we struggle against today are theirs, no doubt.
No … it is not that simple. We call them the Oathbreakers, but they are not evil.\n \nTheir spirits rest in Ouze until the time of renewal. They must rejoin the Bosmer so our race can be whole once again. The Worm Cult would put an end to that hope.
I've been training all day, and I just want to relax.\n\nGot anything that'd help me with that, huh?
A pass cuts through the hills here, yeah? Straight into the Smokefrost Peaks. Normally comes out just north of Riften. But not after that damned giant Sinmur collapsed the hillside.
Bandits, it sounds like. I'm not sure. Only a few of our runners are getting through. I don't know if they're caught up in combat, or …
He and Sinien are already inside. We have one more portal to close.\n\nThe High Kinlady Estre clutches to Dagon's robes. Hides within the Deadlands.
That's all I need to know. Look, I need to get these men to safety. You, I need back in the field.
You have my thanks. With your help, we may have the situation contained before the public catches wind.\n\nI'll head back to the city, find the Pellingare head and let him know what's happening. Maybe get you some armed assistance.
You really need to visit the Sober Nord Tavern. The bard that performs there is phenomenal. And easy on the eyes, too, if you catch my meaning.
South of here. Past the royal work camp at Cragwallow. They say that part of the forest is haunted!
He's a damned skeever, coming after a young girl with a knife. Yiri just lost her father, and now this man tries to kill her? What would the Worms want with Yiri?
The spine of welcome is more effective than that of threat. Deliver this package to Sarisa. I choose to extend friendship when others express hatred.
Fleet movements, navigating the bay, the layout of Auridon—it has to be someone pretty high in rank. Damned peculiar.
No! Too late for me. Must go! Stop Valano … before he escapes.
Well enough. It's good to have a reason to get up in the morning. Without my family the way it was … it's easy to wallow in thoughts of Bleakrock. Of the good days.
Thank you. When I was raising kids on Bleakrock, I never thought I'd be here, doing what I do now. But I'm good at it.
Woof!
Hendil's done so much for this town, all I can do is trust him. Wish this wasn't happening to me, though.
He's here. He piled in right behind the Battlereeve. Said something about supporting the Marines and the guilds.\n\nYou know how he is.
<The audience weeps.>
Then they care about you even less than I do. Get out of here.
<words words words. I had good intentions. Please don't tell on me>
We're always on the lookout for important and rare manuscripts. Books of a magical nature are especially in high demand.
Oh! What a splendid idea. External stimulus in the mix. Here, I'll open portals to their little worlds.\n\nSucceed or fail, this should be simply fascinating.
Certainly more than the Veiled Heritance. While I sympathize with their cause, it seems foolish to wage an almost civil war here in Aurdion while there are greater issues at hand.
Of course, and why not? We are more directly decended from the Aldmeri. We're far more civilized and intellectually advanced. We're not cannibals and don't look like animals.
No. <<1>> says the island's thick with Maormer. Guess I need to trust her vision now since I lack my own.\n\nThe chests are buried in the caves. I trust you know how to use a shovel?
No! My boy. My Iwel.\n\nHendil. Where is he? Where is that bottle-sniffer?
Taken below, all of them. Tovisa tried to escape, but they took her too. They'll be mutilated and murdered, like all the others. You must save them.
Hmm. We've taken every precaution. The whole area is locked down. Watch Captain Astanya assured me.
Ah, ah. No need to get all dry-scaled on me. The answer she seeks is a mirror. \n\nThere are several around, but I know there's one inside the storage building by the water.
We try to follow the pure stream, but that path isn't always easy. Instinct tells us to form a fist and strike, especially when the enemy is upon us.\n\nBut we are not warriors. We have no weapons or armor. And we are afraid.
He's the war-chief, so they're practicing fighting, of course!\n\nLook, in the old days, Helushk was a great protector of the village. But since the curse, he's been going more and more crazy. He thinks his men can be an unstoppable army.
We'll see, we'll see. The War Chief has plans. I think you'll be surprised.
Cracktooth! A terrifying Goblin. I could never defeat him, small and helpless as I am. But I know a brave, powerful champion like you can slay him easily!\n\nHis camp is to the east, across the river.
Get back! One step closer, and I'll cut my throat.
Depends. Why are you looking for him?
"The skystones may not be able to hold the portal open. Should they fail, I'll be trapped. But I'll take the risk. I must find where the portal leads."
Help? No. I don't think so. \n\nActually. My guardsmen are all tied up right now. If you're up to it, perhaps you could look into some things for me?
As you say. The murders brought the Skywatch guard down upon Ezduiin. The cult held off their blades, but just barely.\n\nIn an act of desperation, Essanyon used a magical relic called the Mallari-Mora. Killed every soul here. Bound them forever.
I'll be fine. I'm fortunate you got here when you did. They were preparing to turn me.
Stars, yes. Let's get that bastard. Merormo needs to pay for what he's done here.
These caves were once a great burial mound, where all creatures of the Grahtwood came to die. But a thousand thousand moons have risen since then, and the roots have long overgrown it.\n\nWhat could you be doing here, Oraneth?
The Baelborne heir … he could have been my son, if Maurice had only stood up to his evil mother. Instead, he let her lock me in that tower.\n\nWhat happened? Only what was meant to be.
Your actions will raise the town's morale, I'm sure of it. \n\nI heard you spoke to Marent Ergend. That means we'll soon have more strong hands to help us oust these black-hearted rogues.
I told you, I went to talk to Ilara? I stepped away for five minutes and Tanion's trained dog Malangwe jumped her.\n\nShe's taking Illie to the cave! She can't survive another night in Saltspray, not in the state she's in.
Good luck.
On my mark, magical pillars will appear on a set path. Follow the markers and keep to your feet. \n\nOh, and 'ware the imps. Little bastards have sharp teeth. Ready?
You're kind of an innocent, aren't you? The Morag Tong. Organized crime? A league of assassins? We used to be part of the establishment, but we're kind of on the outs these days. Some of the house leaders still employ us, though.
Why, an invitation to the Academy of Magic, of course!
Unfortunately, yes. That's how he knew about the Jagged Lens. \n\nIn fact, I found him experimenting on a student with the lens when I relieved him of his duties. He was furious when I expelled him from the Academy.
I will start the spell. Once I have the crystal weakened, I will tell you to use the crystal I gave you. Using it will be the final boost I need. \n\nThen I shall be free. Ready?
No clue. Dawnbreak's just a supply stop between Firsthold and Skywatch. Only notable thing about it: the High Kinlady was here just before they hit. Word came down she made it out, though.
I wasn't sure any of the flowers survived the trip here. Coldharbour is a dead place and Kyne is concerned with living things. If you found the flowers, maybe she hasn't abandoned us.\n\nI'll make the purifying potion now.
I won't run. I'll—\n\nTie me up. I'll wait for her to come for me.
Hmm? Oh, sorry. This book is so engrossing. Could we talk later?
Did you indeed? That be well. Let me see it.\n\nI have a plan, but it only includes me.
Not really sure. But I know what it does—burns up ships that pull into the harbor!\n\nIt's usually inactive, for obvious reasons. But the canonreeve should have been able to power it up long before the Maormer pulled into port.
What? That's insane! Their alchemist interrogated me three times. Tortured me! Why would he torture me if I was a traitor?
Oh, aye. Cheap labor immigrants. There are some in town that, ah, hate 'em. \n\nBut at least she doesn't have to pay 'em all that well, eh?
I will strive to make up for what I did in ignorance and selfishness so long ago. \n\nI will help the remaining villagers, as the effects of the long enchantment wear off. But I will grieve for the lost, those shriveled souless ones.
I can't. I promised Father I'd wait for him. I won't leave until he returns!
So you believe. You must win the war first.\n\nNow who will you choose? Angof of the Reach? Thallik of the Wormcult? Or Kinlady Estre, the former Altmer Princess? You may speak to them once more before you make your decision.
Danger presses in from every direction. The city doesn't know how to handle it.
The magic that created this body resides in this land. If I can win this game and escape these Cliffs of Failure, I hope to find its source.\n\nHelp me win and you can take Juline with you. I simply seek a way to end this madness.
Ah. Yes. I theorize that wherever the Daedra came from, they're somehow polluting the energy of these monoliths.\n\n Dispel that energy and—I hope—the Daedra will become powerless.
He wants to prove himself to his ancestors. He thinks there's some sort of treasure, deep in the vaults. Sor wants so badly to be a Rilis. \n\nI just want him to be safe. Please, will you look after him?
I'm fine. I need a drink and I miss Gamirth terribly, but otherwise I'm fine.
I made a bargain, but I was tricked. I realized too late that the mage who promised to help me was likely a Daedric Prince!  \n\nAfter that, the Flagon slipped into Coldharbour and we've been trapped here ever since.
That's because I drink mead! You should, too. Our Special Blend will put hair on your chest and make you strong.\n\nAnyway, have some mead or take a walk. We're having a party here and I'd hate to have you spoil the mood.
Can you have another mead? Of course you can!\n\nVery well, ask what you will. But be quick about it. We don't want to attract any undue attention.
Canst thou see? I am a joke, made real. A spirit, bound by the power-mad knave known as Telenger. I hath served my master faithfully, fulfilled my task.\n\nAnd so now he has me serving. The likes of you.
<A few gold coins glitter on the mossy stonework, marking the wishes of passersby.>
Think with your mind and not your heart. Angof gives you the best chance for victory. We both know that.\n\nI wish there was another way. I wish we could all walk out of this together. But Nirn is more important than a trio of mages.
What? How dare you threaten me!\n\nYou are lucky that I even gave you a reward at all. The balance … the balance must be maintained!
Two fragments of my soul remain imprisoned. Free them, and I would … I would finally be able to move on.\n\nAnconath's cries have echoed through this chamber for years. The silence now is almost deafening.
My research is vital to the study of spellcasting. This amulet may enable the safe and efficient harvesting of potent magicka, such as the wamasu's lightning. It's relatively safe, which makes Drulis's refusal so galling.
Oh, come now! I've never encountered a rule I couldn't bend to my own advantage. You just have to figure out how.\n\nMaybe you can threaten the Observer and make him change his mind. I'd certainly enjoy watching you try!
Do you want that information in the hands of the Pact? No? I didn't think so.\n\nI managed to hide one of their uniforms in my cot. Grab it. Then we can slip past the soldiers and retrieve the information. Simple!
I meant it quite literally. She's my property, a slave fairly traded from High Rock. \n\nIs that my locket? Did she run off with that too?
I'll take those trinkets, if you please. You've robbed me enough for one day.\n\nI thank the Three my father didn't live to see this. You should thank them as well.
I apologize. I was just grateful for the short amount of silence I had while they were out gallivanting around the ruins.\n\nBut, on a more serious note, their bumbling may have uncovered something.
I'm sure she does.\n\nDon't believe everything she's told you. <<1>> is no monster, and <<2>> would be nothing without his wives.
<The cat appears ready to run. She looks at you as if to insist that you follow her.>
Never drink from an unmarked bottle that's been locked away since the First Era with a Daedric guardian stewing in the contents.\n\n"But I'm <<1>>," he said, "and all my drinkings are mighty!" I tried to warn the man. I do hope his beard grew back.
<That's it. I'm done. Haven's just too hot for me. If you want to try to keep up your back-alley trade, you'll have to do it alone …. and that includes creating the mixture.\n\nYou remember how to do it, right? If you don't, here's a clue.>
I don't see how. It's my birthright to rule, and my brother stands in the way.
If I had to guess? The stench in the air. The pain of the afflicted. Dagon. Mehrunes Dagon. \n\nIt's his razor that cuts across my heart, I fear. May he drown in the Font of Harmony. Yech.
Follow me, my young friend. And find out.
Thanks. You were right, by the way. Qor overheard the Veiled Queen talking to these Daedra by magical sending.\n\nShe's behind this whole thing!
I was certain it was a good theory. All part of the scholarly process, my friend! \n\nBut never mind that, I should thank you for your timely rescue! I'll head back to our camp. I cannot wait to tell <<1>> what happened here.
Improvise. Pull a burning log from their campfire.\n\nThen light 'em up—the tents, and all those stolen goods out there on the dock. Hopefully, that'll distract Ma'jhad Kha.
So, you've met the Argonians of Silent Mire. Peaceful, meditative, calm, accepting. Well, not me!\n\nOur home was attacked, my friends killed. Of course I'm angry! Vengeance will make me feel better, so pile those cat corpses high!
His tomb was built upon this lake,\nand in his name this oath I make.\n\nShould evil come, should night descend,\nI swear the Rift I will defend.
Maybe. <<1>> hasn't been the same since he returned. He's normally so enthusiastic about his studies, but he's withdrawn into himself.\n\nIt's downright unsettling, watching him suffer like this.
Navisdyn was killed on the guild docks behind the hall. You may examine the scene of his death, but please respect his remains. \n\nMy mentor meant a lot to me. If you find anything pertinent, please bring it to me. He deserves justice.
<The statue bows, as if pleased.>
Unfortunately, the duke requires that he personally approve all visitors to the library, and he can't know about this. \n\nThe library guard—Sir Gregory. Perhaps you can persuade him to look the other way, or failing that, to leave his post.
As Aelif begins to cast, move to a crystal. Destroy it. Move to the next crystal, destroy it. Move on. \n\nAvoid the barrier, and be fast on your feet.
Shad Astula, the magic school. The boat to the Academy leaves from the dock here in Mournhold. It's a great honor to be accepted and I can't wait to begin.
Oh yes! They recently opened the Academy to all members of the Pact. As long as you have a talent for magic. And if they think you're leadership material.
Well, <<1>> has been working on a ward to use against them. He's just down the stairs, go ask him about it.
Sounds good. I've heard Skald Svari holds out at one of the shrines. You rally her to the Hall and I'll get the others.
Well, I hate to give this up, but I guess you need it more than me. This key opens the door to a hidden tunnel. It might help you get behind those guys.
Fort Morvunskar's primary purpose is to protect the royal tombs beneath it. Most of our departed rulers are buried here, including our dearly missed Queen Nurnhilde.\n\nBeyond that, it doesn't really hold any military significance.
Oh, yes. We start with a lump of metal and end with something useful. Horseshoes and nails and swords and whatnot.\n\nI hear there are other kinds of crafters on the mainland, but I'd never be anything but a smith.
Well, they've got me! Give me a weapon and I'll learn how to fight.\n\nThanks for finding me. I … I don't think I could've done anything on my own.
Can't wait to give these Drublog what's coming to them.\n\nHope the lieutenant has a good morning star. I like weapons I can swing.
Last time, <<1>> got out by the fur on his tail. The ghost wants her lover to stay forever.\n\nBut there is a barrier within. Beyond are the treasures of the Ayleids, locked up for centuries! Nothing like the trinkets I sold.
The poem on the sword opens the ruin, yes?\n\nMore scribbles are all around the ruins. Poetry! Spoken randomly they do nothing, but if we knew how they fit together ….
An old knight. <<1>> the Gold, they called me! I had lands, titles, slaves ….\n\nAll dust, now. Even my love has forgotten me!
Oh father … he was the best man I've ever known.\n\nWhat will we do without him?
Ha! You have the spirit of Ysgramor, my friend. Yes. Two blades are more dangerous than one.\n\nSpeak to <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Choose a companion and tear the Worms apart!
My lord is certain he lost his utensil somewhere in Skyrim. It was during a visit to his friend Korthor in Vuldngrav.\n\nThat was during the Merethic Era, I believe.
In this dream state, only you and I are real—and I'm only really certain of myself.
The merchant isn't your concern. His fate is in the hands of the Farseer and the Ghost Snake.\n\nStill, something disturbs the Vale. I thought it was the merchant, but now the signs and portents point to you.
Yes, yes. I already said that. Weren't you listening?\n\nIt's a rare honor to receive an audience with the Sacred Lady. You should go now and leave this lowly clerk to his duties. We can't all have appointments with the divine.
He claims he was drawn across the leagues by my beauty, but the truth is that Yarelion is the disinherited son of some wealthy mage. \n\nRather than a talent for magic, though, Yarelion has a talent for spending. He would have me be his bank.
I heard their mewling. Look, I'm in this business to make a living. If the old man splits his treasure with us, we'll get him to Anvil.
No. I'm afraid not. I couldn't afford to give her a flower. \n\nSo it was a mirror that finally won her over? Maybe Sir Brice or Raolin Munier was the lucky one. \n\nThere is someone who would know for sure, but I am sworn to secrecy.
Aren't they fascinating? Ayleid civilization interests me. I'm documenting several ruins in the area.
I understand. You're on the countess's business, so I'm sure it's important.\n\nBesides, I can figure it out on my own. I have my ways, you know.\n\nGoodbye for now then.
Do you remember Denskar? Littrek? Do you remember how they died, bleeding from Covenant blades? \n\nI watched it all. I watched them die. You can't know how painful that is.
Maybe. But I chose to believe. It wasn't just secrets. Soon the cult asked me to kill for them. Golun. Thane Fjora.\n\nTryn would despise what I've become. I'm done with the cult, but it's too late, isn't it?
Face justice? Perhaps. But face my family? No. I've hurt too many. I can't do anything about that rotting in a prison.\n\nI'm leaving, going far away. Come after me if you want, but I won't just lie down and die.
All right, all right. Why are you always so close? Stand back and let me work. \n\nI'll lure him upstairs. You wait a moment, then follow us. When I give the signal, go ahead and snatch the key.
They let Raston live, as long as he promises never to speak of the Vale or return here. \n\nThen they sign a trade agreement with me. They deal with me and I keep other Hlaalu traders away. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement.
The Wisewomen may be willing to talk to a female outsider.\n\nBut the Gulakhan is probably the better choice to answer your questions.
Take this to siphon away the energy trapping <<c:1>>. Only then will her bonds be broken.\n\n<<2>> will be at the main arena's entrance. Tell her I understand. Tell her, she was right.
Neramo's nice enough for an Altmer, if you get past his Dwemer fixation.\n\nThing is, the relics he finds in Dwemer ruins sometimes come in very handy. He just might have a device we can use for our heist.
Captain Helane, but she's worse than Bhosek. Her Sea Drakes run <<1>> south of here. Biggest band of murderers on the seas.\n\nBhosek and Helane tolerate each other. Neither's ready for a war, yet.
If by "disagreed" you mean "tried to kill us" then yes. Bunch of bloody mutineers.\n\nLambur, myself, and a few others ran them off the ship, but word spread. No one here wants to sail with a captain who won't raid Bretons.
Another male. And an outsider, as well. Wonderful.\n\nMaybe the Gulakhan will answer your questions. I certainly won't.
They were still in Mauloch's shrine when I ran away. I think <<1>> was stabbed by the shaman!\n\nHave mercy, Z'en! Don't let us be parted like this!
Thank the Eight! I thought I'd die in here!\n\nHelane came by not long ago. Told me to look forward to a public flaying. Then she beat me bloody, laughing the whole time. She's one cold witch.
There are no specific records of what occurred here, only vague references.\n\nKing Aphren allegedly spent all his time at war. While he was away, his enemies apparently attacked Aphren's Hold and killed everyone. The king himself died soon after.
Yes. Please do. Here, take it.\n\nPerhaps it will allow her to rest. Perhaps it will allow me to rest.
No! My flesh and blood, stolen from me by those twice-cursed fiends!\n\nZ'en, this is too much! I beg you, don't give me this burden to bear as well! Curse <<1>>! Curse them all!
No, they can't be. Maybe a splinter group or something. I don't know what to think. Not all of us exactly see eye to eye on our current situation, but to join up with the Maulborn?\n\nThat's just idiotic.
It's a ritual focus. The Drublog used it against <<c:1>>.\n\nRemember I said they drained his energy into crystals? The runestone is the conduit. With it, we can reverse the ritual and give back the energy!
Khali … does not think so. The barrier here seems much stronger. And she senses—moons, that is strange. This one senses a dark energy powering the ward on this door. We'll have to open the door from the other side.
The Ironhand ogres have plagued southern Wrothgar for years, but lately, they've turned toward Stormhaven,\n\nThe ogres seem more organized than they've been before, but it is impossible to know if Vaermina is involved in any way.
No, no. Just … lots of rumors about the council investigation. The old guard thinks Sees-All-Colors would have had a lot to gain from Jofnir's death. And from what I've heard, she's not at the meeting.
You seen Elves runnin' around? The chief's been working with them for a few weeks, getting involved in politics or something. Only gonna end bad, if you ask me.\n\nAnd you did ask me. Now, go away so I can catch my dinner!
Camping. That's funny. Well, if you didn't know, there's trouble in Alcaire Castle—the Bretons and the Redguards aren't getting along.\n\nThe Fighters Guild can't be seen taking sides in their squabble.
I thought the wasps could be useful. I had some success with the process, as you can see by my sweet Chezik here. \n\nBut they are skittish creatures, especially when they reach their full size.
<<1>> brought us here to meet the Silvenar and the Green Lady. We're their escorts.\n\nThe captain would know more. Ask her, if she's still alive.
Bah. She's around here somewhere, sticking her nose into Drublog business. Put me in a foul mood, she did.\n\nGot no right to tell the Drublog what to do. Nosy Wood Elves need to be put in their place!
Why do you think I'd know? Because I'm an Imperial? We're all the same in this place. We're nothing but scum!\n\nLeave me alone!
Ah, good. Werewolves attacked us. I wounded a few of the beasts and got away, but not before they tore into <<1>>. I'd hoped these Houndsmen might hold clues, but nothing.\n\nHave you seen <<2>>? Is she safe?
This bow goes everywhere with <<1>>! She wouldn't give it up willingly. It was an engagement gift from her father.\n\nThere's only one cave nearby which might serve to hide her. It's not far.
No. These shafts are <<1>>'s handiwork. Only she and the Green Lady could weave such sweet death with a bow.\n\nI've seen too many of her arrows. She might have used the last on these three fools.
Raz answers to the Queen, her majesty Ayrenn. The Queen has concerns about a group called the Veiled Heritance. One of my agents has a report for me, and. Well.
The Bloodthorns created a portal to the spirit realm with this Welkynd stone. Vardan is on the other side, commanding the spirits slaying the Orcs. He's trapped over there since we closed the portal.
Yes. Keep it and use it! A discovery like this could tip the war in our favor. Think of all the lives we could save!
Absolutely. His envoy is on the dock now, waiting. As soon as we turn over the sailing logs, he gives us a fortune in gold.\n\nThe trick will be getting into Bhosek's palace, stealing the logs, and getting out with them. That's your job.
In life, I was Gjalder, father to Lyris. My spirit was torn from its rest and brought to this foul place. The Daedra force me to experience my own murder, again and again. I thought my torment would never end.
Great. Just great. If you shake my family tree, my father wouldn't be the only bastard to fall out of it. But he might be the worst.\n\nWe have to reason with this spirit. Show her that I'm not the one who wronged her and I don't deserve her wrath.
No, I just love sodden hands and the smell of wet clothing.\n\nYes, I'm doing laundry, fool. Now leave me be.
Use this by the fire!
Ah, words are so much less effective than seeing the reality of a thing. Now think carefully before you answer my next question. I need to determine if you can truly summon this spirit of the dead.\n\nWhat is the spirit's name?
My dear friend, Headman Bhosek, is sleeping off the attentions of these two lovely ladies. They are quite a handful. And an eyeful too!\n\nWhy don't you take the good headman's key inside for safekeeping?
Our only chance is to push on and win this thing. The guards are beholden to the holder of the Brimstone Crown, the Champion of the Blessed Crucible. The current champion is the Lava Queen. She's been champion for over 300 years.
After Lyris took my place in the Wailing Prison so that we might escape, the Daedra moved her to the Foundry of Woe. \n\nIt is a place of torment and despair. She toils endlessly, making weapons for the enemy.
Please try to find my companions. These cultists are insane, but the hags … who knows what they're capable of. \n\nI'll go find my brother. The poor sod is useless without me.
<The dust layering the bottom of this chest has been disturbed. Whatever the chest held, those contents are missing.>
It's clear entering the temple was a poor choice. My enthusiasm for discovery has caused problems like this before. I imagine Andewen would be happy to provide you a list of past occurrences … but I digress. The temple must be resealed!
Some call her the Duneripper's Daughter. Others the Forebear Witch. We, her loyal crew, call her Captain Kaleen.\n\nShe is a master sailor, though Kasan now wonders where her allegiance lies.
Following Jakarn, of course. Why else would I be along?\n\nI'm looking forward to working alongside him, sweating shirtless in the hot sun. You wouldn't understand.
Not in recent memory. Tanglehaven's not a large village by any reckoning, and the Drublog know we've very little worth taking.\n\nThey attacked without warning, and left as quickly as they came.
Do you really think my manipulations would be so vulnerable? You are not even a hindrance.
Sweet, but totally unnecessary. I'm not interested in flattery or flirting. I just want to serve my drinks and get this day over with.
And go up against the reigning champion, Thane Jeggi? Not on my best day, friend! That man can drink a lake full of mead and still be thirsty.
I'm resigning from the Camlorn Guard. They need builders now, not soldiers.\n\nBesides, that Angof thing is still out there. Someone has to go deal with that. Unless, of course, you'd care to tempt me with a drink before I start my heroic journey?
The Palace of Ysgramor. They've been working on restoring the place for the past ten years and it still isn't ready for the Skald-King's use.
We're collectors of lost relics. Some items we trade for on the black market, other we procure directly from ruins. We take our name from the Merethic Era, the legendary age between the creation of Nirn and the start of the First Era.
She is the eldest and most powerful spinner. A wizard almost from birth, she sees the past more clearly than you and I see the present.\n\nShe draws parallels between then and now. Use that in solving her puzzle.
I wish I could say yes. Astanya got closer than anyone else has. Subverting a watch captain. I can't believe they'd be so bold.
Hmm. You're here about the rats. Good. I can hear them down in the well. \n\nThey must have found some way in, a back way. And lately some of the water has tasted funny. Bah!
I didn't get a good look at them. They swept through the Fists of Thalmor like a storm of arrows.\n\nThere was nothing I could do but run.
Yes?
This one was doing a bit of clean-up in Vulkhel Guard after the Astanya incident. Heard about your problems here and thought we could lend a hand. \n\nGot here too late, of course. Your efficiency is impressive.
She has gone to a place called Tanzelwil, north of here. An ancient Altmer custom, where monarchs speak with those who have come before.\n\nAs a Khajiit, it is something Raz can respect.
The Houndsmen. They wanted <<Ac:1>>. I wouldn't tell them where it was hidden.\n\nWhoever you are, you must make certain the Hound doesn't obtain it!
Stormhaven is safe, thanks to you. And I'd say the Daggerfall Covenant has more than a fighting chance. I'd put my money on it, at least.
The cult focused all their power into their abominations. Now these are dust and ash. The threat to us is ended, but the threat to you remains.\n\n<<1>> wishes to repay our debt to you. Speak to him. Learn your true peril.
Wonderful, a heroic fight scene for the finish. \n\nAnd then Dabienne swooned in your arms as you freed her from the stocks?
The mysteries of Nirn span beyond the Dwemer. The Ayleids fascinate me in equal measure. I had to see this place for myself.\n\nThe more vexing mystery at present, however, lies with these Orc spirits.
This one collects the means to return home. Will the kind stranger help?
No, Kalari would like some time alone to think now. Perhaps you could help old Milk Eyes? \n\nKalari reads to him, sometimes, and as of late he has been complaining of rats in his well.
His true name is Akkhuz-ri. We've been friends since we were children. He was brought up by the lunar clergy, as all Manes are. I was the son of Elsweyr nobility. We both knew we'd make our mark on the world. I never thought it would be like this.
Slowly and dangerously. I hope Mandin is having more success than I am. \n\nThe Red Rooks have certainly been an annoyance. The more of them you put in the ground, the better.
That sounds like my sweet Odei. Kindest man in the world but as helpless as a kitten. \n\nWe spent the night at the Lion Guard camp nearby and he must've wandered off. He sleepwalks sometimes. Odei's not used to rough living.
Get your disguise and meet me out back. Leave Bhosek to me.
The Great Tree, of course! You know … the massive tree we're standing under.\n\nIt easily towers over Daggerfall Castle. Simply magnificent!
This Lord Diel, something's not right with him. Why does a noble care about harpies?\n\nBut whatever. It doesn't matter. The Daggers need to get paid. If not, our mercenary group collapses and we're all back to the streets. Again.
I wish I knew. The rest of the Daggers made it back, but there's been no sign of my brother. I had my doubts about getting involved with Lord Diel. I just wish I'd told Gelvin about them.\n\nBut who are you anyway? Why do you care about any of this?
Take your time. The spinners work with the past, present, and future, and likely left clues to help solve the puzzle of their bindings.\n\nLook carefully at each stone, and read every book within their chambers. I'm sure you'll find the answers.
You know Captain Marck? Very good. Then you'll have an easier time convincing him to pay S'rashi back.
Ha! Orcs don't settle lands, we take them! The Seamount clan was the scourge of the seas. We took this island when Chief Yzzgol cleared out the Bretons.
Sure. I tracked a few of them to their cave. Rather than poke around on my own, I decided to wait for you, my friend. And here you are!
Don't you know anything? Hircine! The creator and guardian of all were-creatures?\n\nHircine's Call … well, it calls to their true nature. Reveals them for the beasts they really are.
I vowed that I would always face my opponents as an equal. If an enemy came at me with a sword, I would meet his blade with one of my own.\n\nThe harpies fight with claws. How could I go up against them with anything more than the fists nature gave me?
Nothing yet, but it needs to get stuck on one of these pikes. That's where it belongs.\n\nYou should do the honors. It's only fair, since you defeated him and all. That should put the fear of Shor in the rest of those Stormfist lackeys.
Yeah, I figured that out. His lordship was also behind the whole harpy menace thing, too, wasn't he?\n\nWell, it's a good thing I decided not to count on Gelvin to turn a profit.
I'd love to hear your theories, but it won't mean anything if we don't take this camp back first.\n\nWe need to be able to reach Faolchu to actually defeat him. Let's talk after the siege camp is once again under our control.
How did you know to find us here? How did Jone lead you to this one's side?
Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't you contact me? Fascinating. \n\nAre you merely a blundering local, I wonder, or something more?
Juluda-daro has only a small piece of the puzzle. Have you found any of her fellows?
Hmm. I have never heard the like.\n\nMay I have another clue?
Thank you! This'll show the old lizard!\n\nNow, pass me those ingredients and I'll whip something up quick!
Not sure I entirely trust that young fellow. But standing around doing nothing doesn't sit well with me, either.\n\nI'm not much use in a battle, but I can spread the word. We'll raise an army to deal with these Red Rooks!
You didn't even know him … you ….\n\nNo, you're right. Heseph wasn't a soldier, but he was a strategist. He was trying to work around these bastards. The least I can do is continue what he started. I'll do whatever Sellan asks.
Orc scouts sighted Bloodthorn Cultists in Carzog's Demise. Tazgol's mobilizing the army to go kill them all, but Lambur's worried. She thinks it might be a trap.\n\nDid you find out anything?
Go to Temple District
Koeglin Village smelled like a dock, and I don't appreciate the sort of riff-raff that comes off those boats. \n\nRowdy sailors knocking over my wood piles and stomping my flower beds every day … By Azura, I couldn't take it anymore!
I could always go into treasure-hunting. I hear there's some kind of valuable stone down in the Koeglin Mine.\n\nCourse, I could end up with something worse than splinters…
You're right. I value my family, but this is my life. I should live it as I choose. I'm going to follow my heart.
Of course this is my house! I told you it was my house. Why would I be in here if it wasn't my house?\n\nAnd you're still standing there. Didn't I just tell you to leave?
Watch yourself. You are a guest here.
I doubt it. Everyone was so caught up in staying away from the Houndsmen that no one cares about the band.\n\nI bet if you head across the bridge and into the ravine you might find some trace of them. Unless the mers got them.
Must try anyways. Do not have much time left. Still have chance of saving, even now, just much more dangerous.\n\nMany thanks to you for trying. Will remember that, whatever happens.
Without my reagents, I couldn't protect myself from the horrors that roam the Dreamstride.\n\nBut I don't blame you. At least you tried to help when no one else cared. That means very much to me.
I don't see a portal, but … I have to trust my instincts. Let's cleanse the shrines and let the bright moons shine down on this place. You see to the temples of Jone and Jode. The old shrine to Lorkhaj still stands. I'll take care of that one.
No, but it could have! I used to explore a lot, go on adventures. And then I discovered that old Ilessan Tower. The place gave me a really bad feeling.\n\nNow I know that adventuring isn't for me. I'm staying in the city from now on.
Perhaps if I rest a moment, I might be able to continue.
Pah. With the Green stalking my steps, I'll have this bounty before anyone else!
I don't know exactly, but I think it has something to do with the rations. \n\nI … I looked in one of the sacks. His rations. He makes them from giant meat!
So you'd think, but we've never caught any of the traitors. They may not actually be Bosmer at all. \n\nOur enemies are always one step ahead of us. Oromin doesn't want to believe it, but I think it's obvious there's a spy among the Thalmor.
A fair point. Raz … er, I will keep that in mind. \n\nYou have spoken with the treethane then? You understand my genius plan, yes?
Both. I fought at Emeric's side in Ranser's war. We helped drive the Reachmen from Stormhaven, and in exchange, Emeric returned Orsinium to Orc hands. \n\nThat conflict was of mutual benefit. This one isn't.
For sale? For sale? Are you mad?\n\nThese instruments take me years to make. Each one lovingly crafted, I travel the world for the woods, the inlay materials. Sell them? It would be like selling my own children.
You impress me, stranger. I have one more task for you before I include you in the ritual.\n\nThe giant's leader prowls the hill above the village. Kill him, and the giants will submit to us. Then their power will truly be ours!
You mean, I must go to the shrine? How can I resist my master or question his wisdom? \n\nNo-no-no, I can't. I-I'm too afraid. Forgive me Woodland Man, but I can't stay here!
Madfolk, every one of them. They think … I don't know what they think. They're sure they can force Falinesti back here somehow.\n\nIndring, the leader of the cult? He's maddest of all.
I take it you're not from Morrowind, then? The Pact's treaty forbids slave trade in either Nord or Argonian lots. Fine by me—slaving always left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nMaybe one day there won't be a market for slaves at all!
Are you serious? Well, you'd have to buy out my contract. You got that kind of coin on you?
Glad we speak the same language.\n\nDamn! Should've asked for more.
Take this whistle. Our first priority is to save Murkwater's people.\n\nWhen you locate them, use the whistle to signal my agents. They'll take care of the rest.
It should be in one of the chests we unearthed. Be careful as you open them. An ancient evil guards the keystone.
Necromancers, practitioners of the most vile magic, and the bane of the Alik'r Desert.\n\nIt has been many years since we faced such a threat. I hoped the rumors about this group—the Withered Hand—were untrue, but today's events prove otherwise.
And miss you embarrassing Garnikh and "his" hunters? Not a chance!
Ancient relics, the creations of my ancestors.
Even now, our subjects petition us for succor.\n\nThey wail day and night. We hear their pleas, and even now they call to us.
This looks familiar. Looks drew something in one of his journals like this.\n\nWhat is it?
Lob and his champions must fight you in the prescribed order. They can't attack you all at once. They have to play by the rules and challenge you in waves.\n\nYou'll be able to handle that. I have faith in you.
You are wise. I see now why you were the one destined to recover the Fangs.\n\nGive them to me. I swear we will keep them safe.
Meridia protects me. I champion her cause against the Daedra, and she bestows her blessings upon me.
You say it truly. She will remain here, a prisoner in darkness. Only through the strength of her heart, the wisdom of her mind, can the evil that is the Dark Mane be contained.
I would not have made it out from this cave if it wasn't for my sister.\n\nI blacked out from exhaustion and the cold. Nurnhilde carried me the rest of the way to safety. Damn it all. I don't know how we got out of this cave.
Hmm. Again, not what I expected. I think I've heard of this … "Aldmeri Dominion," but I don't see how inclusion in this group would appeal to me or to the people in my domain. \n\nAligning with you would only alienate us from others.
It's hard to explain.You know how sometimes you think you see someone watching you out of the corner of their eye?\n\nEverybody in town has been looking at me like that since I got back. I swear to the Green!
Yes. It'll be your guardian! Use this husk and build the one you want. Then we'll test it against the others.\n\nLead it over to challenge two other guardians. Tell you what—you can even use these healing roots to give your guardian an edge.
The last days of the Dwemer were endless war. Their mages raced to perfect ever more esoteric spells. Ever more powerful weapons. Perhaps the origins of the Vivicus stem from that long-gone era.
I am the last Ayleid king.\n\nIn our ancient language, my name means Ruler in Dark Times. I can imagine no darker time than the end of the Ayleid people.
She might seem crass, but she has shown her worth. I would gladly follow her; she has a righteous will and the strength to back it up.
You are wise, my friend! This little beast was found in the wreckage of a Daedric Anchor. I confess, she is my favorite. Swifter than swift!
Well done, outsider. That should give the Hist time to heal while the Dremora rebuild the refining vats.
I'm sorry, but we do not have time. Ask me later, when this is over.
You can't hear the noise? Piercing, like fleshflies roosting in your ears? And the smell, like … moss and alit hide, set aflame.\n\nBut we must remove it from these ruins, before the Dominion returns.
Started a few weeks ago now, when the mist … changed. Turned a sickly color.
Hrrm. Keystone makes it faster to get to <<1>>. <<2>> supposes Pact-soldier could fight through countless snake-ladies and angry-dead to avoid losing the keystone.\n\nIt may have uses elsewhere, but <<2>> does not know.
From what I gathered, one of Naemon's servants has stolen General Malgoth's bow and compels the Blackroot Clan to fight by the Right of Theft.\n\nWhat we need to do is steal the general's bow back, and then we can release him from his vows.
He cowers in a room sealed by powerful wards. Pah! Bretons and their magic.\n\nTargoth, you should interrogate our prisoners. Perhaps one of the fools will betray their king!
All right. You're going to have to protect me though.\n\nThe chamber may be clear now, but as soon as I start the ritual, they'll realize it on the other side. They might try to charge through and stop us.
They aid their king in his foul plan to kill us all! Unless they tell us how to stop him, his magic will wipe us out.\n\nWe are at war, Targoth. Do what you must.
Good. I'll find <<1>>.\n\nGo. Get them back safe.
In the center of the ruins, behind the door you cannot open. \n\nThere. I have told you what you asked! Now unbind me, cursed Orc!
<The armor bears the insignia of an Aldmeri Dominion marine lieutenant. His corpse is soaked in blood as if from many shallow cuts. Greenish foam mingles with the smeared blood.>
Look for hampers with clothes, or kill a Sea Drake and take theirs. Put on their clothes and you'll look just lovely.\n\nOh, do watch out for the Sea Drakes with torches. They're not drunk. If you get too close, they'll spot you and alert the others.
Yes. This one is pretty famous. Perhaps you have heard of Zur? But Zur must tell you. This soul-meld is killing us. Will you help us? Will you unmeld our souls?
You're blind to it. Easily remedied.\n\nFollow, if you can.
I followed his orders. Daedric poison, for the Wood Elf and his mate. I followed his orders.
<<1>>. He said they could stop the tempest. Had to be removed.
I do! By all the gods, I do!
Praise the gods. Thank you! She was going to ….\n\nBind me, and I will leave for <<1>>'s judgment.
Ha! The cat didn't tell you, did he? No, we can't send any guards. We don't know who we can trust. \n\nHe thinks the two of you can handle it though. I don't know if I'd call that confidence or foolhardiness, but I hope Baan Dar is with you either way.
Sweet and salty in a stew? Hmm. That is not a bad idea! Good luck finding this Tand. Dulan must try this new recipe!
Yes. There we will find out the truth about this Thalmor Officer, Asteril. She's quite the beauty, I'm told. But traitors are never what they seem, yes? \n\nThis one is … no, I am ready when you are.
Let's not use harsh language. I've liberated certain objects from people who really don't need them anymore. Where's the harm?\n\nA word of advice, though. If you see any contracts from a group called The Midnight Union, I'd stay away.
Quite well. I've not yet secured enough capital to launch another expedition, but Captian Marck has been quite generous since he discovered my talents as a mage.\n\nI've even had the opportunity to set a slaver ship on fire. Exciting work.
You and everyone else in this forest, it seems. My clan has already declared your allies to be trespassers. You don't want to know what we do to trespassers.\n\nThe Shadow Walkers will catch them. They always do.
Vampires feed upon this essence and weaken it.\n\nKill the vampires and collect the energy they siphoned from me. Restore that energy to me and I can easily break free of these flimsy bonds.
We heard voices in the woods. We thought it was other members of our expedition, calling to us for help. But Captain Alphaury figured it out. The voice comes from this tower.\n\nWhoever's locked in there needs our help. And he will help us in return.
I must return these eggs to our nest. But there is one more thing you must do before my people will feel truly safe.\n\nPlease, may I tell you about this final task?
Don't blame you for being cautious. Just think it over. You change your mind or want a chance to get off this wretched island, you know where to find me.
Just following orders. Even before this, Stibbons couldn't keep up, so Lady Laurent hired me.\n\nI was just getting a bird's eye view before getting to work. Say though, if you were going to save Stibbons the trouble, why not help me instead?
Utter tragedy. When my kwama unearthed the Dwemer ruins in these caverns an illness afflicted my miners … and the kwama.
Yes. They say it was a paradise. I often wonder what they'd say if a mage offered to return it to the surface.
Keep him busy, would you? I don't want to decorate his axe.\n\nAll right <<1>>, you can do this. Faster than a fleshfly, nimbler than Khajiit.
Well, you've come to the right place. It's one of my favorite tales, though it's quite embellished these days. Better for frightening the children away from certain dangers.
I might have something that will do the trick, assuming they haven't fully turned. But I expect you to do something for me in return first.
That one saw its mother get cooked in the pot and hasn't lost a race since. Guess it doesn't want to end up in my belly!
Enjoy the combat! Who will you bet on? <<1>>? Or <<2>>?
You can't fail. You just can't. Were the Shadow Walkers down here helpful? Do you need to talk to them again?\n\nWhen you're ready, just use the portal behind me. Present a good argument and make it count.
The most frustrating of all—politics and religion. Our Guildhall is not a permanent fixture here in Sentinel. We operate at the pleasure of the king and his viziers. They could make things difficult for us if they wanted to.
While it allows you to see anyone hiding in the shadow realm, it also masks your presence from them. I've used this method to avoid patrols and sneak out of the forest. It really works!\n\nBut remember. The effect is temporary. It doesn't last long.
Always with the violence! Your kind. So predictable.\n\nVery well, take it. This one hopes you choke on it!
I'll ensure the Mourning Stone remains guarded at all times. I should make a full report so the Dominion understands the danger of <<1>>'s capabilities.
I'll try. Might get distracted exacting some much-earned payback on these monsters.
Scout Paranarth. I … I'm sorry I abandoned the Captain. This is my first fight. When the Daedra attacked, I just. I lost my nerve. It won't happen again. I promise.
Small things, but they add up. An old man complaining of rats, someone said their home was haunted.\n\nAnd Zal-sa thinks someone said children were stealing their crops.
None of your business.\n\nGo bother the clerk. He doesn't know when to shut up, either.
When the wind goddess Khenarthi first traveled across the heavens, legends say she grew tired and rested in the branches of a small sapling before resuming her journey.\n\nThat sapling became the Great Tree, and gave <<1>> its name.
Yes, <<1>> shares a temper with hurricanes. After a great quarrel with this one, he stormed off and left us short-clawed. Father had to cancel his trip to <<2>>, and now he's ….
Oh, Mathal is probably off getting into trouble. Again. After our father passed away my uncles Enak-do and Ezzag tried to teach him right from wrong. He would never listen.\n\nKalari has barely seen him since we inherited this house.
The poor animals that roam the Valenwood … the people. I … shall consider what you have told me and pray for an end to the pain and suffering.\n\nThank you for sharing this news with me.
Of course. What do you need?
Feluni's staff confiscated some recently. It's in her private quarters.
You have now witnessed the first sacrifice, and you know that true honor need not be named.\n \nYou are one of us. You are Ash'abah.  We will recognize you as our sister and together, we will uphold the sacred duty of our tribe.
We've seen more and more <<m:1>> lurking around the island. They must have supplied the family with equipment needed to brew skooma.
New recruit, eh? Then you need to know about our mission boards. The Bounty and Scouting boards are on either side of me.\n\nEvery so often, Sorcalin sends Vilya over with new missions. I post them to the boards for all to see.
A decision must be made. It may behoove us to take the fight to the Maormer immediately, or there may be other tasks you think more important to address first.
A hurricane blew up out of nowhere just as we got within sight of Khenarthi's Roost. The seas went wild. We tried to make a safe landfall, but most of our ships foundered.\n\nI fear many of my men were lost, but I just don't know.
I don't owe you an explanation of my choices. \n\nYou have Sangur's orders. Go kill your new enemy.
The three elemental crystals, yes. But more than that. We also need a key to open the locked gate.\n\nI saw them place the gate key in a guarded coffer in the northern section of the ruins.
Some. Some <<1>> picked off dead men in the sands of Alik'r. Others, straight from the palaces of Dune.
Who knows? Who cares? The blathering fool created such a mess here. He's become a liability, especially since the Tomb of Kings.\n\nI have a new man assisting me now. He's much more … efficient. Not as efficient as you, but you're not for hire.
Where? Do you have a death wish, then? They're south of the bridge if you're anxious to die, friend.
Yes. He took many mages with him, and he would probably take you, if you asked. He will do anything to get his sister back.\n\nI caution you again—you court a dangerous beast by entering the Hollow.
Yes. Like Khali. I've spent so much of my life studying. So much spent examining texts, words. Action, though. Action is needed to be a true leader. Let's go, Hallowed.
The war isn't very old. But I've already seen enough action to hold plenty of grudges. Let's just say she cost me.\n\nAs for what I'll do … that's up to you. Get her to move however you like.
Once you have what we're looking for, head towards Krin's compound. We'll need to get inside if we want to grab back our intel.
He's not? Well … I'll be a lizard's uncle. I guess our little talk may have convinced him after all!\n\nWe all went out drinking last night, and my cousin and I made one last attempt to talk him out of it. I guess it worked.
You must understand. I love my little brother, but he's so naive. He shouldn't associate with a Crown girl, let alone marry her. \n\nOur father—Tu'whacca keep his soul—would never have approved, so I cannot approve either.
Warlock Carindon? He is … obsessed with his work, some say almost to a fault.\n\nBut he is on the forefront of the art, ever-seeking new frontiers. An excellent quality in a Mage.
This outcome, while sad, is for the best. We shall give you a boon to help you in your struggle. Without the vampiric shard, the Hist will pass on naturally.\n\nBut first, you need to convince An-Jeen-Sakka to accept your decision.
Who I fight is not the question I should ask. The question I should ask is: Why do I fight? I fight to protect those I care for. And, perhaps someday, those I lead. Thank you, Hallowed. I could not have done this without you.
The Staff of Magnus is an extremely powerful object. There's no telling what wickedness he could achieve, if he desired it.\n\nRest assured, he would not have accessed the vault if we'd had any suspicion of his loyalty. Someone must inform the queen.
Depends. Ufgra handles all the day-to-day emergencies, while Prefect Antias deals with long-term issues. Just don't ask her about Zenithar!\n\nYou'll find them both in town. Antias is usually in her house, but Ufgra likes to be outdoors.
Unbeknownst to me, hordes of undead decided to suddenly haunt the ruins. I went trotting in, soiled my trousers when I saw what was there, and just barely escaped with my life. I'm never leaving this village again.
Treasure hunter. I used to comb the ruins of Culotte, an Ayleid ruin west of here, for artifacts to sell. But that place has gotten a lot more dangerous lately. I almost died last time I went in there.
Well, if he doesn't complete the contract soon, he'll have to eat his wife. Alanya seems like a lovely girl, and I don't want that to happen.
The key must open the Admiral's Coral Tower. Take it, enter the tower, and kill the Admiral. \n\nAs for me, it's my duty to look up me dead relatives and see what I can do to help them. Even if it's only to lay them to rest.
They will give her to the witch. The Rock Witch.\n\nThe land will kill her. They said the land ….
We did what we had to do. This isn't your fault. This is … this is Ayrenn's fault! That witch. She held the Dominion so tight that it suffocated. And now we have no more breath in our chests.
Yes, they took him so that she … she had to help them place those crystals. They did not tell her at first, but as soon as Ezreba saw one she knew. They summon the Dro-m'Athra.
The trip was not without its perils, but everyone watched out for each other.\n\nThe Groundskeeper told us we could settle here, in the Shining Star Inn. Rather nice place, don't you think?
Quickly? It's been weeks since the bandits attacked!
I'll follow you. I'm … I'm not going anywhere by myself! Such a brave soul!
Every member of the Dominion should cherish the Elder Scrolls. Our sacred trust to protect them must be our primary focus.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls are prophecies, in essence. But they are much more than that.
Shattering the blade was the only way, albeit there were … consequences.\n\nNecromantic energy was released, causing the dead of Tava's Blessing to rise. The necromancer himself is not a lich, but he has become … a powerful spirit.
Not so loud! I left because I couldn't take it anymore. Geneura made us hunt people for meat. I hated it—hated smelling their terror and hearing their screams. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ran away.
Would you like my blood?
So I had hoped, but it seems Vicereeve Pelidil has taken to sea even before we arrived.\n\nI suspect he may attempt to flee when he realizes his forces have lost the shore. That's why you must go after him. You must ensure Pelidil does not escape.
Because they're rich, that's why! That big house has bags of gold and jewels, I've heard. We hit this place and we never have to work again. I can't believe Klovag isn't here.
What? There were spies prowling around here! I knew it!\n\nThey probably waited until all the workers fled and then moved in to steal the designs. Damn cowards!  Which one of the ship designs was compromised?
This is all so stupid. A few months back, I was traveling near Cyrodiil and ran across a group of refugees. I started talking with a little girl who'd lost her family. Ended up adopting her and brought her home. Along with a good haul of coin.
It's the perfect place. Not many people know about the docks here—it's not exactly a regular port of call. \n\nWe can build the ships without too many prying eyes.
Shuzura must admit … she let Rakhad too close. She let Rakhad do as he pleased, for so long. When he was her assistant, Rakhad would often use an old cave outside of town for … projects.\n\nShe never asked. Because she did not want to know.
There's been so much fighting, so much death. Even if we walk the path through the Den of Lorkhaj … seeing these visions has made me realize how critical the Mane can be. I don't know if I'm ready.
I wish I could tell you. Fahara'jad's naval shipyards are here, but I cannot imagine why the Withered Hand would care about that.\n\nI hear these were sacred grounds back in the days of the Ansei. Perhaps that is what drew the Withered Hand here.
We are simple people here and we know little of magic. As part of the contract, Alanya offered herself as our pact-hostage. I want to give Master Pircalmo more time to work his magic, but he has little time left.
Zeht's blessings be upon you, wayfarer.
I … the unmitigated … how dare … fine!\n\nTake them all and do not return. My master will be angry, but not as enraged as he would be if the game was permanently disrupted. Now, be gone with you!
My what? Oh, my guide. I seriously doubt he has anything to contribute to my research.\n\nDon't worry about him. He will be compensated appropriately. As will you. Talk to <<1>>, please.
No. He cannot be slain now. There is a way, but … I am fading.\n\nWith the ward broken, my strength … wanes quickly. I will presently go to the Far Shores, unless you can reforge the blade.
To take out a fort's door, you need a ram. Simple as that. Deploy it, get it up to the door, and stay with it until the door crashes in.\n\nEasy.
There's no one else. I'll certainly not be a replacement for the master, but I will try my best. I must, for the sake of the school.
And you brought it to me …? That's quite an honor. I promise you, for as long as I live, it will not fall into enemy hands again. \n\nNow, only the final Ansei Ward remains … but if Uwafa and Alasan are gone, who has it?
After all the evidence from Fakimal's house, that's surprising. If she's not behind the disappearances, I can't imagine who is.\n\nTell me though, why am I in the stocks? There's no evidence aganst me.
You would just leave me here to rot in the desert sun? How can you do this when you know that I am innocent of any wrongdoing?\n\nYou had expressed a willingness to help me before. Something about this is very suspect. I hope I am wrong.
Let's … let's continue on the Path. If the Bright Moons felt we needed to see the future of the Bosmer … perhaps we shall now see the future of the High Elves. Let's hope it is not as bleak.
I've dreamed of this moment. Seriously. I always knew I'd end up fighting to save the world in Coldharbour.\n\nI mean, you were a beautiful warrior with flowing red hair and an ample … well, no offense. But otherwise, this is just like my dream.
Nothing can ever be absolutely certain, but yes, we're with you. Nirn is as much our world as it is the rest of these people's. How can we do any less than they are?
A crew is not complete without its captain. They would be lost without me.\n\nSo, sadly, I must refuse. But have no fear. When the sky clears and the wind blows strong, my pirates and I will sail to your side. It will be glorious!
This island serves as Captain Blackheart's base of operations. \n\nHis ship, the Black Death, is anchored here between assaults on the sea.
Yes. He's bound by the Unwritten Laws of the Ungodly. My father can't refuse a challenge and keep his position as the boss.\n\nJust … don't kill him, all right? He may be an ox's arse, but he's still my father.
Husband of the treethane of Woodhearth, Fariel. As good a fighter and tracker as any Wood Elf I've known. Just shows how Pelidil caught even the best of us off-guard.
Since your revelation, I've been in torment.\n\n<<1>> always put the school first. When provisions run low, she goes without. When new weapons arrive, she tests them herself, lest the students be hurt by imperfect blades.
Despite what you may have heard, a bucket of water to the face isn't a traditional Argonian greeting.\n\nBut I'm not one to stand on ceremony. What's on your mind?
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Good one! \n\nWait, you're serious? The Daedric Prince, Lord Sanguine? Patron of debauchery and indulgence? This is his temple. As you might imagine, no one throws a better party!
I sent my squad to scout <<1>>. If they haven't learned what the Sea Vipers plan, we can poke around until we figure out what needs chopping.\n\nAnd don't worry, your wizard friend can seal the gate behind us.
I don't know, but I have to try something. As I suggested before, perhaps the only way to defeat the darkness … is to embrace it.\n\nI think I might be able to draw the corruption out of the Heart and into myself.
I never said that. I'm a Centurion in the Queen's own. Happy and proud to be an Eagle. I'm just saying that the men and women under my command are dying today to hold a ruin. Not for the glory of the Dominion, for a ruin.
Thank you. I will see to its safeguarding personally.
Very well. I will remain and lead the defense. May your victory be swift and sweet.
Because that is the only thing I drink, O curious one. We are an austere people, by and large.
Ha! The Ash'abah have many enemies—those who don't understand us, and so they fear us. And those who do understand us, and fear us even more. \n\nThat was not very forthcoming, was it? Very well. Necromancers would poison us. For them we slay.
This scarf. This scarf was Verana's. She was always getting cold. She's really gone then.\n\nI have nothing to give you. Thaellin took all I had, to find my daughter.
She said she was going to the northern shore of Lake Rumare, to look for Verana. If you find her, maybe she'll give you the coin I paid her.\n\nThank you again for bringing me Verana's scarf.
I can dispense with an archer or two, but I need this central point defended ….\n\nYou could ask Laeneval, our healer, or Elolir, one of our longbowmen, for help.
Truly? Thank the Eight! My friend, without you, I would never have found out what was going on. Thank you. Alanya and I are deeply in your debt. Where is she?
I was beset by many troubles on the journey from Tava's Blessing—scorpions, dunerippers, and then, not far from here, I was ambushed by the Withered Hand.\n\nI managed to kill the dirty dogs, but not before they had hurt me pretty good.
Thank you. Now, as any other student must, please speak with <<1>> at the forge.\n\nWe will speak again.
I concur. That would be a wise course of action.\n\nWhen you feel our forces are sufficient for the task, return to me.
I-I just don't know. Her brothers are dead and we have recovered two of the Ansei Wards … does she have the third? \n\nIs the Withered Hand now under her command? Was it all along? There are so many questions. I will need time—time we don't have.
Ill-informed, impulsive … mortals! Did you think you could just stroll up to the portal you seek?\n\nThe Valkynaz guards a key to the maze beneath Molag Bal's stronghold. You must pass through this Labyrinth, and to do that you need the key.
Never look a gift daedroth in the maw, little mortal. I offer information, nothing more.\n\nThe warded building you seek is near the main gate. The kyn will try to stop you. If they don't succeed, we will speak again.
So, we're safe again? \n\nI've worked out a deal with Shatasha to rent the ruins to the Mages Guild for research. If this place is as big as she says it is, I'm set for years.
My head on a sharp stick. He's a violent, vindictive thug, and those are his good qualities. I got into debt to him, which is a bad place to be. Rather than pay up, I ran. Not far enough, apparently.
You are as generous and kind as you are brave, sister. I hope we walk the sands together again someday.\n\nUntil then, remember … true honor need not be named.
Of course. Which would you like to hear about?
I hunt and I fish. I do it better than the rest. The others respect my strength.\n\nThis tribe has forgotten how to survive. You want to know my role? I remind them what we left behind.
To prove worthy, a candidate must walk the trial path to its conclusion. Here in the March, that is the temple at Dune. Here Shazah or Khali will walk the final path: The Two Moons Path. We may speak more of that day later, Hallowed.
They're mercenaries, and the Canonreeve has paid for their services.\n\nThey act as an extension of her Thalmor guards, and I am not willing to have my mages attack a Canonreeve. There would be too many political implications.
You saw the all-devouring darkness that burst from Oraneth's altar. It swallowed Dracien and Bakkhara whole.\n\nOur leader disagrees, but I know one does not return from magic like that. If you insist on going, you should speak to Kargand below.
For General Malgoth, that's apparently the case. For all his ambition, he was still a staunch traditionalist.\n\nIt's actually quite impressive that his sense of honor remains intact even so many years after his death.
Don't feel bad! Could have been the sand's too hot, or too cold.\n\nIf you've done everything right, best just to try again.
Not right now, sorry. This one isn't working and we don't have any others here. Once you get out on the battlefields, you'll get plenty of chances to use rams.
Not well, though they already accused me of having a weak bloodline, so their derision was more limited accusations of going native and the occasional off the cuff reference to bestiality than outright threats. Until now.
The Bosmer were tight-lipped, but I pieced together something about mourning kidnappings, listening to rumors around town. Please, help me find her.
The Maormer wore lodestones on their wrists. It let them ignore those lightning bonds. But I couldn't find any more, so I jumped off the ship and swam for it.\n\nPlease, don't let them sacrifice my crewmates!
By Y'ffre, he gave you the flute to find me? I'm sorry, but my old life is over. I was so absorbed in the little lovestruck world we made for ourselves, I forgot mine and its needs.
The March is in turmoil. The future of the line of the Manes is in danger, and threats bubble up from within and without. We may be far from the heart of Elsweyr here, but Rid-Thar goes where his people need him.
We spoke for the first time last night about … about the Mane. About all the pressures that one of us will assume. She, of course, says I would be better at the job than she would. Says, "my wisdom and intelligence are what our people need."
Hmm. Yes, your guide is difficult to miss. The Warrior. Straightforward, willful, brimming with wrath. \n\nHeed the counsel of Jone and Jode, walker. Without the little moon, the big one is left to spin alone, lost. Do not count on strength alone.
No, Hallowed. This must be your decision. Speak to the Champions if you need to. Hear what they have to say before you decide. This must be your decision, alone.
Your friend is out there, being hunted by my people as we speak. If you have questions, ask them quickly so we can get back to the task at hand.
After the soul-meld, the Overseer ignored us. The Dwarven constructs were inactive, so we were able to work here in relative peace. \n\nYes, Gadris, everything was fine until Zur exploded something. The Dark Elf sure knows how to hold a grudge.
A Khajiit rogue called Nineclaws, a fellow Bosmer by the name of Draulduin, and an exiled Breton mage known as Zavierry. If they aren't wounded, they'll be able to make it back to Longhaven on their own once you've freed them.
Yes, we are Baandari on our way to Sentinel. We planned to take our goods across the sea. All was well until we reached this wretched place.
Surely you have heard of us? We are the wandering litter of Elsweyr. Merchants, soothsayers, entertainers … this is ringing chimes, yes?
Fixed? It may never be fixed. Wheelbreaker here has been toying with it for two turns of Jone and Jode. \n\nWe need tools and wood, but the dungy Redguards cannot spare them because they want to repair their homes.
Exactly the right question!\n\nIt seems the Sea Vipers use a specialized lodestone to block the channel. Approach an active <<1>>, hold forth the lodestone, and harmlessly siphon the energy away. You should see for yourself.
Other than grumbling about harpy droppings? Just girding ourselves for the next anchor raid. \n\nOur new Guildmaster, Sees-All-Colors, has all of us wrecking those damnable anchor things and slaying whatever Daedra come with them.
Yes. The Guild seeks out all manner of books and scrolls.  Any that you bring to us will improve your reputation with the Mages Guild.\n\nReputation leads to rewards, and as you advance through the ranks those rewards will increase in value.
By all means. Do you want to know how many Daedra can dance on the head of a pin? How I manage to stay so cheerful even in the most perilous of circumstances? What's my favorite color? Ask away!
Yes, the Bosmer religion does not allow the use of paper, so they use animal hides instead. Not many use it in Marbruk.
I've secured a spell to get us out of this plane. However, in order to channel it, I require a sacrifice.\n\nAnd I'd like—I need it to be you.
I'm not sure how to tell you this, or even if you'll understand, but you died at <<1>>'s hands.
I fear he is either dead or taken captive. We were attacked by so many, so fast … I tried to find him, but to no avail. I came back to catch my breath.\n\nWith you here, though … I am willing to try again. If you are … that is.
No. After she finished the ritual, she left, but I think the Ward is still in there.\n\nPlease. You have to go in there and get it, and then find Throne Keeper Farvad and the Ward he was carrying. I'll catch up … if you'll untie me first, that is.
Driving off attackers is always the first step. Then repair kits can be used to fix some of the damage. Here's a practice repair kit; use it on a siege weapon here.
Our relationship wasn't always like this. That first night was wonderfully raucous.\n\nOf course, it only took a week for him to try to kill me. Let's see, that was … last week.
Is there? What did you have in mind?
Oh, there's far less glamorous work to be done in <<1>>, at the northern end of the island. Let's meet up there, after you've done what you decide to do. \n\nUntil then, Bright Moons guide your steps.
I am going to finish my examination of this device, of course. Then I'll determine what our next move must be.
Hasn't the Observer explained things? He is the gamemaster. My associates and I, we're the contestants. We play to win our freedom.\n\nOf course, we need pawns to play the game. Luckily, the mages arrived just in time for the next match.
Do I look to be in a mirthful mood? \n\nThere comes a point when even a patriot's loyalty is stretched too far, when the things he has done—and has seen done—become too much to bear.
Catapults are wonderful weapons against enemy troops. Meatbag catapults spread disease, oil imparts fire damage, and scatter-shot causes impact damage. I envy the death you will inflict among our foes with these weapons!
There's a vat on top of the platform. Use it as you would any other siege weapon.\n\nDon't pour it on me or this useless ram.
Truly, you are here in Bergama and just now hearing of them?\n\nI'm speaking of the huge anchored chains which erupt from the skies and spear down into the ground! Everywhere around them, the Daedra gather to slaughter all who come near.
Books in this temple contain information about the Elder Scrolls, if you wish to know more.\n\nGrand Warlord Zimmeron needs to speak with you when you're done here.
All Pact soldiers should covet the Elder Scrolls. It is our destiny to control them all!\n\nThe simplest understanding of the Elder Scrolls is that they are prophecies. But they are so much more than that.
It is our sacred duty to gather and protect the scrolls. Every Elder Scroll we hold grants power to all the soldiers of the Pact. This is another reason our enemies cannot be allowed to keep any of them.
They attacked at night. It was chaos. I saw Igarri get hit, helped her in here. I went back out, to help others. Cultists and Dremora everywhere. Leg got slashed, barely made it back. I couldn't help anyone, just listened to them scream.
This one will survive. Soon, our foes will discover that not all in Bruma have been declawed!
I don't see any. Go to the Manor House if you want hope. Grigerda keeps sending out messengers on fools' errands. None have ever returned. We have a full dose of reality over here; there's no room for hope.
Grand Warlord Dortene needs information to plan our strategy. A Scouting mission sends you deep into enemy territory. Find your target, scout around, then report back here.
You didn't recognize the Dremora from her projection? I think her name is Doshia. Quite full of herself, actually. \n\nHmm. This note mentions an "island tower." Aelif wonders if it speaks of Stonefang.
Cyrodiil is the heart of Tamriel. The alliance that controls Cyrodiil can strike in any direction, threatening the other heartlands. And that alliance will be the Ebonheart Pact!
Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as a comrade in arms of the Fighters Guild! Get out there! And take the fight to the Daedra!
Wait until I am in position. \n\nThen you must undo the final binding stone. The High Kinlord will then emerge. Fight well—you fight for Tamriel's safety.
The requirements for correcting a violation of the Green Pact are well established. Three kinds of proof are required for judgment: witness testimony, physical evidence, and a magical omen.\n\nWithout all three, no judgment can be rendered.
The old fashioned way! With claw and blade and spell. End the Atronachs while you hold the Fang, and their essence will be transferred into the relic. Once it's primed, it should be simple to seal the portal.
Righto! Always happy to pitch in. Lend a hand. Steer a course. Make a difference.\n\nI'll get them to the Hollow City. Very nice inn there. Plenty of mead. They'll feel right at home.
My associate and I have a mischievous nature. It is through this nature we show our affection for our friends. \n\nOur close friend Khalima is, as Timiwe would say, "a grumpy bug." We want to lift her spirits.
We pushed back the Daedra. You heard Tharn, he means to walk the Two-Moons Path himself. I can't … I can't put this off any longer. We need to make for the Temple of the Dance. Follow me. I'll lead the way.
The Hallowed is kind of like a guide, or guardian. When all is peaceful in the Khajiiti subsconcious, the passing from one Mane to the next is like the arc of the Moons in the sky. Serene, untroubled. When things are not so peaceful ….
Their names would soil your ears, wayfarer, and I will not utter them. Know only that their intent is dishonorable, stealing the recipe for this finest of wines from its rightful owner. Their wines are pale imitations of the one true Nirnroot wine.
I don't really know. Niriel just said that if you use them when you destroy the totems, it'd help convince the Orcs that you're a forest spirit. Maybe they grow flowers or vines or something? Niriel said a High Elf woman gave them to her.
We accept this lightning charred rock into evidence. Please place it on the table.
In my sleep, I hear his tormented screams, and Molag Bal forces visions of his eternal torture into my mind.\n\nI can show you exactly what I see—if you wish it.
Actually it was Honor who found them.\n\nHave you met? We've been together, forever. He knows Coldharbour almost as well as I do.
As you say! I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will now earn you reputation in the guild. Good luck!
We can teach you unique techniques only available to members, and provide access to special spells and abilities. And from time to time projects crop up for those with an adventuresome spirit. You may end up working with Guildmaster Vanus himself!
The first Briar was a skilled hunter called Thaldil. She single-handedly protected Brackenleaf from being destroyed by Colovians during the Imperial occupation of Grahtwood.\n\nShe followed the guidance of Brackenleaf and established the Briars.
Each of the Five Companions were chosen for their skill and courage, and each was given a special role to perform in the party. \n\nWho would you like to know more about?
Sai Sahan came from a long line of Redguard swordmaster nobles. He was the leader of the Dragonguard, the security detail of Varen and the Elder Council. While Lyris was Varen's bodyguard, Sai was charged with protecting the entire group.
Hah! Good question. We train our members in special techniques. And the higher-ups are always looking for motivated members to help with special projects. Colors herself might even have a task for you someday.
Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as a comrade in arms of the Fighters Guild! Get out there! And take the fight to the Daedra!
Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as a comrade in arms of the Fighter's Guild! Get out there! And take the fight to the Daedra!
No! No, please! I beseech you to reconsider this decision, Sameer.\n\nI cannot bear to see you exiled. What will I do? I am not sewn from the same cloth as you and father. I am not meant to be king!
It is strange, but wait and listen. Outside, a woman peddles her trained lizards. Ask if her pets can track scents, such as this bug musk.\n\nJust holding the vial leaves residue on one's hands. If you find who held the vial, you'll find who stole it.
I guess you're right. Ah, well.\n\nI won't take up too much of your time. You've got destiny and all that, written on some moldy-old scroll.
You never get used to it. My father … he'll die over and over again for the rest of my life. Grief doesn't go away. You just learn to live with it. \n\nBut I can live my life with his daring and spirit and joy. That way, he'll never die. Not really.
First, the Planemeld must be stopped. Even now, forces gather and plan an assault on Oblivion itself. You must join them.
Evil is abroad across Cyrodiil. Innocence and piety are no protection. Bands of robbers killed our abbot and priests and looted our relics. All but myself, Constantina, and Trano have fled. The priory must close, for now at least.
She's a coward and a bully. Once her nature's revealed, my father won't let her back into <<1>>.\n\nWe'll need to return whatever she took to the harpies on the balcony. Head inside and find it. I'll try to convince them we're all friends.
Yes. That tree is me. Or rather it is the life form in which I was the life force. \n\nBut another came and by foul magics took my place. Merethrin the mage. He cursed us both.
Huh, you make some sense after all.\n\nI will support this foolish plan if you can convince the other leaders.
It summons all the shades, I suspect. It certainly doesn't control them. Not that I've found, anyway.\n\nAlthough … hmmm. The markings carved into the scepter are old Ayleid for "<<1>>." Could that mean the creature at the heart of the ruin?
I did not! <<1>>'s servants hurt those people. They don't like you if you aren't from here.\n\nWhen he wakes, he'll control them completely. Just like me.
<<1>>'s wife. They fought and fought, because he was a bad man and she was a good woman. But she thought she could change him.\n\nWhen she realized he'd always been bad, she locked him in here. But the lock grew weak, and now he's waking.
Give or take a decade. It's my fault, really. I was insufferable!\n\nDon't know how she put up with me, to be honest. Taking me apart was the best thing for us both!
To keep people out! Why else? Spirits hate disturbances.\n\nAnd to keep the bones from wandering away. The Barrowbough grew around the oldest skull in the ground, you know.
Absolutely not! Get it away from here, immediately! I cursed that axe myself! It draws spirits and undead like flies to honey.
Brilliant young woman. Keeps records of all the bones buried here, big and small alike. Every dead Elf in the ground is important enough for her to track!\n\nSuppose it's why she was annoyed with me for inhabiting these Elf bones, instead of my own.
What's to tell? We were on patrol, watching for more of Montclair's mischief. When we stopped to check on Hinault's farm, we were ambushed!\n\nWe knew Montclair had troops, but we never expected that he had a damn army!
<The flesh of this unfortunate mage has been completely eaten away, but on one bony finger his signet ring remains intact.>
He's my son. I'd do anything to restore him to a fraction of himself. With refinement, I can make him whole again.\n\n<<1>> thought this hubris. If she hadn't left this world, I'd try to make her understand.
I'll show her anguish when I bury my axe in her skull! \n\nLet's keep moving. And, listen … don't mention this whole thing to anyone. I need some time to figure out what it means.
From the beginning of time, there have been enemies trying to destroy Y'ffre's creation. They sought to take Brackenleaf's heart for themselves.
I think not. I may not be a mighty warrior or a powerful mage, but I am a genius and a master tinkerer. I know I can help. And my sister, Kireth, as well.\n\nPerhaps we can stay right here and guard our flank. Yes, I think that's what we'll do.
I return to you this storied weapon in the form of your choosing, then: a longsword. May it strike swift and true, in service to the Guild and all we protect.
I return to you this storied weapon in the form of your choosing, then: a longbow. May your arrows strike swift and true, in service to the Guild and all we protect.
I'm not sure I can take much more of this. People are dying! I've lost friends … people I looked up to … I can't lose Raynor, too.\n\nThere has to be another way.
Go after him! I must tell everyone what's happened. Everyone who's left, that is.\n\nIf he can't be subdued and forced to complete the ritual, he'll have to be killed. And that's on your head, not mine!
That's strange. I didn't see <<1>>, and I was here all that day. <<2>>'s apprentice is rarely away from her side.\n\nCurse that girl, I hope her feelings for <<3>> didn't drive her to foolishness.
They're minions of Molag Bal, out of Oblivion. He's taking over the city, from what I hear. The army must still be fighting, though, or hordes of Daedra would be pouring out of the city.
It might work. But if you tried, who would help you open <<1>>?\n\nThe impertinence.
I have only one desire: to be whole again. But I sense you cannot help with that. I sense neither a scultor's spirit nor his skills. Your abilities lie elsewhere.\n\nBut if you ever encounter such, in your aimless wanderings, send him to me.
Ah, mine is the saddest tale of all. I left to escape a forced marriage, to a man I didn't love. I killed him first, though. And for that I was branded an Ouster and can never return home.
Yes. As a Daughter of Baan Dar, I've presided over countless Boasts. And this has been one of the best in my living memory.
He has his uses, but he's stubborn, thick-headed, and a coward.\n\nIf it were up to him—and I am quick to remind him it is not—he'd leave the Oblivion Gate where it is and flee.
She ran off after what looked like a dark cloud. I saw her running west, toward the river. Pretty sure it was that mad Argonian she was after. \n\nThe Captain hates necromancers. That's probably why she was so intent on pursuing him.
Well, I started to make my way toward the Hollow City, just as we discussed. And then … and then … and then I wound up here.\n\nThe rest is all just a blank, I'm afraid.
You do have a choice! Not like me. <<1>> listened to me, said he would take me down a golden path.\n\nNobody in <<2>> ever respected me, or gave me a chance to prove who I could truly be. What choice did I have but to make them all see who I really am?
I … yes. Quite pragmatic. Forgive my frustration, I haven't spoken with another person in years.\n\nBut we'll have time for conversation later. Come, we must retrieve <<1>>.
At the base of these ruins is the hole her torment tears between worlds. But the moment we enter, Molag Bal's servants are likely to sense our presence. \n\nI'd have long ago made the attempt myself, if I had anywhere to flee.
Take my amulet. Get down in the center of the rings and feel the earth. I need the energy from there to keep Elara alive.\n\nI need to take the child back to my hut. It's just up the hill a bit. Can't miss it.
In the depths of this ruin is a portal leading straight to <<1>>. We can only close it from the other side.\n\nOnce in <<1>>, we'll have no hope of escape unless <<2>> is inside that stone. Quickly, I can't keep this up for long!
I'm an old woman! And such magic requires precision. Wrestling with bears impedes precision.\n\nSlap them about their faces, throw sticks at them, call them harsh names. However you must, keep their attention while I do the complex part.
I'm sure you are. I'm sorry too. Now we're both sorry. Isn't that grand? Now you handle your business, and I'll handle mine.
Don't think I haven't heard about your exploits. Rumors abound. You've toppled Daedric Princes, defeated armies, saved more people than I can count.\n\nOne day soon, I'll be saying "I knew you when."
Well, let's see.  I haven't bitten anyone in almost half a day. Now, there was that Bosmer last week…
Would that we could! But no. Our cooperation is quite finished. \n\nI will drown my sorrow in ale for a few more days. Then, I will try to find another ship. What else am I to do?
Not long ago. The Forebear King has kept us quite busy. The compensation for our efforts has been generous as well. All told, it is a good time to sail the seas.
Well, let's see. There was an earthquake, a giant fissure opened in the middle of town, lots of villagers died and buildings fell apart, and flame atronachs came out to attack us. Am I leaving anything out?
Secure the Dawn Posset. Protect her captain. Sentinel is not a place to leave your ship unattended, especially after the docks have been attacked.\n\nThis is my ship. My crew. I won't let anything happen to them.
No one bothered to inquire. More than mere slaughter, I should think. \n\nWhatever their motives, when they crashed upon the walls of the Garrison, they slew hundreds—draining them of their blood and casting down their empty husks.
Other than harassing me, you mean? Good. See that you do. \n\nNow I must find a way to keep morale up so the populace doesn't panic.
You think that would help? The Reachmen are pillaging our towns and farms. Our citizens are desperate for food and reinforcements. Can you bring us some?
So I have seen. A mortal has managed what the eternal dead could not.
I opened my home to many I met in my travels. A young Redguard swordsman, a scarred Wood Elf hunter, a Psijic outcast … I can still hear their voices.\n\nBut that was ninety years ago. Those not killed by the Daedra must have fled.
Could you kill someone you love? I can't! Well, I have. But not <<1>>, it would be too pedestrian.\n\nNo, I want you to try killing him.
I do. Nature is not philosophical, it is pragmatic. \n\nWe do not make judgments based on idealistic morals and complex theories. We make judgments based on experience, and experience tells us that you are all the same—not to be trusted.
Well, if the queen sends me some gold, I'll take it back.
Your story has only begun. \n\nMolag Bal still has plans for you. In many ways, these events played out to his advantage. And you have attracted the attention of the other Daedric Princes, as well.
I wouldn't say that. They just don't know him. \n\nRenchant's doing the best he can with what he's got. He's taking action. He's the one who put Captain Hjurrun in charge of defenses. I'm trying not to hold that against him though.
For us, it's just sticking by the queen. If the Magus-General starts chanting, we go for the windpipe. \n\nIf things really go to Oblivion, we'll be shielding the queen until Gabrielle can get us all out of there.
Yes. Sir Etienne was adamant we do so, though our venture seemed ill-fated from the start.\n\nWe didn't expect these wild ones, these Reachmen, would best Evermore-trained soldiers, and yet you can see how poorly we fared against them.
That's some small comfort, at least. \n\nPlease, leave me so I can grieve in peace.
There's not much to tell. Most of the people here are fishermen.\n\nThe longest journey most of us have ever taken is to cross the Bjoulsae River to sell our fish to merchants in Evermore.
No! They were thieves, every single one of them!\n\nThis land isn't theirs to live on, it belongs to the people!
We're tired of sailing independently. We planned to hand over the treasure to the Thalmor so they could make us privateers.\n\nBut <<1>> led a mutiny, captured most of my crew, and kidnapped my wife. Once he has the treasure, he'll kill them all.
What? Is it my Sorion? Is he … is he all right?
And as a little girl I wanted a pet guar I could decorate with ribbons and call Penelope. But we don't always get what we want. Especially in war.\n\nThe Light has guided us this far. It is not done with us yet.
It is these Orcs. I mean, I don't have anything against Orcs personally, but we can't expect them to act civilized forever. They are Orcs, after all.
A very good story. I don't know how a scamp like you has such good friends, Cinder-Tail.\n\nWhich way did this thief go? He made off with enough moon-sugar to knock over a mammoth.
Of course not. And Jode's Chariot does not have the authority to launch an investigation. <<1>> will not be happy.\n\nThank you, citizen, for your vigilance.
The Reachmen have been dealt with? This is tremendous news! \n\nThe Imperials then. They were attacking Southern Bangkorai before. They will not rest, but now, my undead army can drive them back.
What? I thought <<1>> was mad. A Daedric Prince, in <<2>>?\n\nIs he in the cathedral? We should clear the town!
Steal? I guess that's one way of looking at it. Let's say I circumvented the market—I found the price the merchant was charging unacceptable, so I set my own.
Some call them thieves, but that's such an impolite term. The Hollow Moon's work is charitable by nature.\n\nThey procure things for people who can't afford them, yes? Here, take this token to the ruined temple, and see for yourself.
My hirelings? Oh, yes. Of course. I'm glad you found them. Now, please, put the cup right there, if you would.
Probably. But they're animals. I don't see any other way to reason with them.\n\nStenwick needs the bud, and we don't have time to coddle the spriggans. We need their cooperation, whether they intend to give it or not.
Yes, one of the women of the woods. I was taught never to trust them, but Isa thought they could help us retake Northglen, and keep the Reachmen out of Evermore.\n\nShe might still be with them on the shore. There's an entry to the ruins there.
Money for Sula. Sula say, "Go to trade post. Buy herbs. Spices. Come right back."
Good. Release me so I can give <<1>> the thanks he so richly deserves.
The woods offer us shelter, food, and water. You see everything we have laid out before you. What we need, we have.\n\nLiving in a village places so many burdens on its people. Conform, obey, suppress. Our lives aren't like that.
The prince went into a rage. He started shouting at Father Quiston, saying this was his church, and he was relieving Quiston of his duties. Then he just … ran inside. \n\nWe have to get in there and talk him down.
Yes! Shambling about gripping swords in their bony fingers. \n\nAnd the sound they made. A sort of … creaking. Ugh, I can't get it out of my head.
Bah, you're tugging on my vines, yeah? …Oh, you're serious. Right. \n\nThe Mages Guild is a club for geniuses like myself. Very select. We spend our time seeking books, tomes, and the like in search of knowledge. Preferably dangerous and forbidden.
Yes, as this one said, that is why he is here. We have much to do. Many demons to slay. \n\nI have not found many with five claws here, but you seem strong and sleek enough. Would you be interested in joining the Fighters Guild?
There is no question. My time as an adherent to the Eight has prepared me for this. I'll deliver it to <<1>> without delay, and without incident.
Magical constructs created by Molag Bal to guide his vision in Coldharbour. \n\nThe Sentinels are connected. If we destroy one, the others will be blinded. With any luck, that will buy us the time we need to free the Prophet.
Considering what happened, we should not call Maldred Adusa's friend.\n\nHe betrayed me. He betrayed his town. A quick death was too good for that traitor. Unfortunately, you dealt with him before I could get my claws into him.
The Evermore soldiers? And why should we trust them? If we left the Viridian Woods, they'd cut down our trees in days, and mine the land with no regard for the life harbored there.
He must have come over here five times already. I'm not and will not ever be interested in having a drink with him.
I developed this little trinket to summon a banekin. I thought it would impress the Archmage, but instead it got me kicked out of the Mage's College.\n\nI was thinking of testing the trinket here—you know, to frighten someone and have a laugh.
Isabeth was a foolish girl. I should have disciplined her better. Made her stronger. She never followed orders. I knew this way of life would get her killed.\n\nHow can I possibly consent to this alliance with her blood on their hands?
No. It's too late for that now. We have to move forward and hope we're not overwhelmed by our own forces.\n\nBut if any of them turn into bloodfiends, I promise to end their suffering as quickly as possible.
I shall have to somehow drag Stibbons back to the other camp. It's a bother, but there's no help for it.\n\nOnce you've observed the results of your trials, meet me back there with your report. That data should enable me to concoct the final antidote.
Never! This is your fault, vampire! Your presence altered the relic's magic.\n\nBut I can restore Leila! The relic has changed me. The others, as well. We're stronger, more powerful. This sensation, however. How odd! I have a sudden craving for blood.
I will place you there. When you've won—if you've won—return to the shrine. I will be there as the Spirit of the Hunt.\n\nWe'll discuss your prowess and your final task for the grotto when the hunt is over.
I think that someone must've mixed something into the beer. The spiders looked so much … smaller last night.\n\nPlease, you've got to get Garth back.
There was jumping, some acrobatics. It was quite heroic. Raz tried … he tried to get the others out. But the collapse happened too fast. He took a grevious injury. Raz had to rest and recuperate before he could rejoin the Queen.
Died in a battle with the Reachmen—right there with King Eamond. You have to feel for the queen. First she loses her daughter, then her husband and her son. \n\nPrince Adrien deserves a proper burial … just maybe after the graveyard's safe again.
No good reason, I'm sure of it. But we don't have a choice. If <<1>> shows up, you'll need to capture him.
You'll be the first person Adusa calls. Promise.
The queen? Of course we can do this!\n\nWe shall set out for <<1>> at once, if you are ready.
Adusa … my oldest, most trusted ally. Tell her that House Ravenwatch is hers now. She must carry on our work … continue to train Gwendis … and any others who need her help.
She left. Said she had to search the farm houses.\n\nAre you stalling, or do you truly believe we can trust the soldiers of Evermore? Isabeth spoke of an alliance too before she left. Well, you can finish her work. Will you take <<1>>'s head or not?
Alive? He's been missing for the better part of the year. Everyone thought him dead.\n\nI've long suspected he lives, and have an inkling of who holds him. Tell me the name of his jailer, and I'll know if you speak the truth.
The Blacksap Rebellion needed my family to begin, and now it lives in the heart of the people. It will flourish, in time. But I'd rather be at my father's side when it happens.\n\nI did surrender, yes? Shall we be off?
We had contract. And the lady … pays well. She wanted stupid cup.\n\nShe needs to know … the cost of recovering the cup.
We avail the sick and those too weak to care for themselves by whatever means present themselves to us. Sometimes this means acquiring food. Other times simple company is enough.\n\nWe do what we can, however often we can, so long as we are able.
As expected. Silver is a powerful tool against the undead. Makes sense that it works against bloodfiends as well. Still, I'll put it into the book for readers who might not know.\n\nWhat didn't work?
So, we know how to hurt bloodfiends. But the disease that creates them, the bloodfiend plague. We need to know more about that, how to prevent it.\n\nThere are bloodfiends in Moira's Hope. Go there and figure out how to prevent the disease.
No. For many years, I dreamt of escaping the current that carried my life, but it demanded I swim upstream, and such a sacrifice I was not willing to make … until now.\n\nI suspect Brigibeth will not make the sacrifice, and she will not change.
Good question. You wish to serve the Camoran throne? You can start by asking <<1>> why his people aren't fulfilling their promises. He's the one who seems to have the entire Elden Tree lodged up his flue.\n\nI can say that. I'm the king.
After the Imperials tortured me, I played dead. They threw me out to feed the jackals.\n\nMy skills have never been tested more so than these past few days. I've kept watch on their camp, biding my time, which is how I know about <<1>>.
Interesting. Silver hurts the undead, but it doesn't ward against the disease that creates them.\n\nHow quickly did the plague spread?
Story goes that there was an Orc warrior, long ago, that came through the region looking for spoils and battle. He met his end in the ruin, dead at the hands of an Ayleid lich. \n\nOnly thing they found of him? His finger bone. The name stuck.
Goblins? Certainly not! I've been studying the local gargoyles—I believe they're the key to certain Yokudan myths and legends. It's my own theory.\n\nNow, I'll need you to retrieve my supplies, and then perform Stibbons' duties in his absence.
I don't know what to think. There was a time when I would have followed King Ranser into Oblivion, but since Markwasten Moor, he hasn't been himself.\n\nIt seems his hatred for Emeric has completely consumed him.
Are you crazy? No one gets out of this mine alive.
<<1>> said he's on the hill looking out toward the desert.\n\nI'd go with you, but someone has to carry this big baby to safety. Good luck.
No. If they were, it would have requried a great many sacrifices to maintain.
He's my husband. I believe in everything he does.\n\nBut is this the way I wanted to spend my last hours? Of course not. I had hoped to ease his grief by trying for one last miracle. I fear, however, that when this fails things will only be worse.
I thank you for your concern, but I am well-versed in restorative magics. I will recover quickly. \n\nMephala's web grows tighter by the minute. Meet me at the spell key in the center of the ruins once you've destroyed the four focus stones.
And don't think you can try anything. I'm not just here for my good looks, and Yarah is more than capable herself.
The Imperial fool Quatrius believes he's invincible. And in a way, he is. If one were to raise a blade against him, his soldiers would surely cut down the child out of spite.\n\nBut there are other ways to cow a man.
Chirane Manor? I know it well. Nice to see we finally found a good use for that pompous ass.\n\nI'll meet you there. We'll discuss the contents of my son's journal when the entire team is together.
Almost. You recovered the pieces needed for <<c:1>>'s activation, so it's only fair you're here to put them in place.\n\nSo I should be the one to ask … are you ready?
Eyevea was an outlier island in the Summerset archipelago. The High Elves gave it to me in exhange for some baubles, minor artifacts of no real consequence. It was a beautiful place ….
What the legend says. It revealed the person within.\n\nAs it will do to me.
Adusa has her own inquiries to make. You must decipher this code.\n\nSeek out my friend, Sahil. He should be able to help. He's usually on the second floor of the Dead Wolf Inn. He loves to watch the fire burn in the hearth.
Of all the places in this temple you do not belong, it is there you belong the least. \n\nBut I sense that where the others have come to violate the chamber's sanctity, you have come to restore it. I will give you my blessing if you prove worthy.
I'll set a trap for <<1>>, with my dear Niha's help. Once you have the powder, take it to The Drowsy Owl Inn upon the hill and get the rest of the details from her.\n\nYou can see your destination from here, if you need to get your bearings.
There's a bottle of wine in the alcove for you, though I've no idea what you'll do with it.\n\nI'll serve it to Maradem, and then you and Ufa can do what you must. But after that, I'll have no part in what comes.
They ready themselves for battle. We will hold the palace while you take out the Imperial within.\n\nWe must all move quickly.
He didn't do this out of malice. He just wanted to support us. He hates that I have to work so hard. He's a good man, but they'll kill him for this!
Grand! If you could, pick up the shipment and bring it back to me.\n\nI'd go myself, but <<1>> and I … well, we're not on the best of terms. A misunderstanding, but hazardous to my health. Tell her you're there for "Treeshade Imports."
Damn Osgrikh! Damn the stronghold! I left peacefully. I harmed no one, left with nothing but the clothes on my back.\n\nAnd in return they slaughter Esmaeel? Murder him in cold blood?
When they were younger, I'd grind <<mz:1>> into paste and give it to them as a treat. I think it would raise their spirits again.\n\nBut nobody sells <<mz:1>>, and I can't leave my shalks to fade away while I scour the coasts.
I … I need to get outside. Find my father.\n\nI need to make sure that Northpoint's all right.
Mother Lamae was the first of us. Molag Bal made her his unwilling bride and through her brought terror to the night. Through her, he created the vampire kin.\n\nShe is the Blood Matron, mother to us all.
Wonderful. If this tome is correct, there's a passageway hidden in the library. I'm sure you and <<1>> will find it.
You? I'm a decorated general of the Aldmeri Dominion, a hero to my people. Who better qualified to wield the power of a god?
I'm afraid you will have to decide that for yourself. \n\nI must focus on searching for a way to repay Lyris's bold sacrifice. I cannot simply abandon her to the wrath of Molag Bal.
Would you look at that! Just the smell of the things seems to have perked them up. I'll see if I can use them to motivate my little friends.
Funny story. Irien sends me letters. She says Jakarn's taken a fancy to me. She says he even wrote me a poem.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn't interested, but that seemed to have the opposite effect. He's turned into a lovelorn fool, Irien says.
I'll swear my own oath to Malacath. With a blood sacrifice.\n\nOsgrikh's siblings, Thrug and Larzgug, were with the Oathbound that took us. They should work nicely—help me get their heads and find a ritual site, and I'll handle the rest.
Naruk saw through me. I'm not … cut out for spycraft. He had questions, and figured torture would loosen my tongue.\n\nHe doesn't know me very well.
It's the ritual. I did not have the heart to speak of it before, but I can't put it off any longer.\n\nThat fool Najan told me that the Daedra has been abducting people. It is, no doubt, collecting them for a summoning ritual.
We must stop this mysterious entity from stealing our lord's forbidden knowledge.\n\nThe entity's wisps absorb mind essences from the Rain Disciples. Kill a wisp and take its essence to the troughs. I hope this will expose the entity's intentions.
You're bold to ask. As you observed, I am a Dremora, but the Lord of Knowledge freed me. \n\nHermaeus Mora taught me the secret of how to sever my ties to Oblivion and bind myself to the Mundus instead. I have served him ever since.
I serve Hermaeus Mora; dealing with illusions and obscurities is what I do. \n\nExposing these vague quantities, turning confused innuendo into clear knowledge, this is my lord's realm.
<The bookcase shudders a bit as you perform the sequence that allows entry.>
Gobani and I know when we have outstayed our welcome, yes? \n\nA night in the stocks might not be as bad as losing a paw, but all the same.
Our goal is to find <<1>> before she buys passage out of <<2>>. Staying in the shadows, avoiding unnecessary conflict … that's what I'd do.\n\nBut there's a lot of ground to search. I'll follow your lead.
There is a reason he hired a guide. I've heard him call for me, but it seemed he walked in circles and came no closer.
Out in the back with other impounded shipments waiting to be destroyed.\n\nYou can pick it up if you want to assume the risk, but I cannot guarantee your safety. However it is one less thing for me to deal with, so feel free to pick it up.
He fought for seventeen bloody days until at last he faced the dreaded Mahgzoor in single combat. \n\nAfter many long hours, the Goblin struck a killing blow, but Hallin smote his enemy as he fell. As fine a death as any Redguard could aspire to.
I sent my tavern boy out to fetch some water from the well. On his way out the door he simply brushed one of the Imperials with his shoulder. They took offense and demanded an apology. He refused … stubborn pride.
Hmm …. I would have thought someone as mighty and well-traveled as you might already know. I am Mephala, The Lady of Whispers.
We were set upon by highwaymen out in the wastes and nearly starved before finally arriving here. Then what little merchandise we had left was seized by the Imperials.
I don't know. I was hoping you knew, but now I'm disappointed … again. \n\nI always tell people how bad things are, and then they get worse, and so the next time I see them, I have to tell them all over again. Do you want to know what else is sad?
Who knows why nobles do anything? I never did trust him, though. Ever since he supported Ranser against the High King.\n\nBut I'll tell you this. There were vampires in Montclair's ranks. Even his officers seemed to take orders from them.
Yes! Yes, wayfarer, just so. Don't let it win!
All right. Let's see if all your answers add up. All that matters is whether I can open this damn lockbox ….
<The diagram includes a map of Razak's Wheel, and seems to indicate that, if you can find the cog mold, you could create a cog using nearby machinery. The cog can then be used to complete Razak's machine in a chamber farther south.>
It's my father's ring. I took it from his bedroom when I was a child. When he found out, he boxed my ears.\n\nThis proves nothing. Only that you may have slain my father, before you came for me.
Why, I live here of course. Along with all the other families of note. Wayrest attracts the wealthy like a bar attracts drunks.\n\nI was just visiting our dear friends in Daggerfall. And stopping by my other house. Well, one of my other houses.
I only know so much. They started out as just a small band of adventurers from High Rock, exploring old barrows and caves, killing bandits and monsters, that sort of thing.\n\nOver time though, they became notorious, especially in Morrowind.
Speed won't help us if we wind up rushing to our defeat.\n\nWe need to learn as much as we can before we attempt to confront Montclair.
Heard a rumor that some Goblins in Varanis took over a cave; been causing a nuisance for some Dark Elves. Place is called … Fungal Grotto.\n\nYou may find your adventure there. Goblins for sure.
Oh, kick around here, I expect. Catch up with old friends. Scare a pilgrim or two.\n\nAll this dirt … it's rather dull, isn't it? The Wormies were the most exciting thing in ages!
Ha! This one's a piece of junk, won't even move. And that's the only one we have. Once you're in the war, there'll be plenty of rams.
I did no such thing. Like moths to flame, my followers are simply drawn to dark mysteries, and this one was simply irresistable for them. \n\nIt's a wonder more of them didn't die.
Well, any day your aren't eaten by ghosts is a good day, yes? Though you may feel different after what happens next.
What a wonderful idea! Yes, Khajiit would love a drink.
You'll find it way off in the Rift. If you can get past the stink of the Nords, it's a wonderful place.
I know only what scholars have told me. They were Elves who worshiped Daedra, enslaved and tortured others, and were vile beyond words. They died long ago, leaving behind ruins like Sercen.
You're right, I didn't.
I name no names, but seek the poor near the town square. Ask if they've seen a cat with red fur, and there will be your answer.
Yes. That's why we require a stay without their family before their acceptance. They must understand what it will be like without their loved ones.\n\nCan they cope? Can they live in this village forever? They must be sure, or we won't risk it.
To start: a hunter's challenge of skill. I will bring the Hunting Ground to you: a shade of this realm and my own. But this time, you hunt my aspects themselves. Only then will you earn the chance to retake the grotto for the Wyrd.
Yes. Why are you staring like that?\n\nTempest Island is known for bad weather, but nothing like this! They're saying it's the Sea Elves' magic at work! There are even whispers of an invasion of Malabal Tor! Sounds to me like you should make a trip.
Is this some kind of jest?
And if we never find it? No, kill the spriggans. It's the best chance to do this quickly.
Yes, yes. Things are fuzzy, but I think I have the strength to make it back to Ivarstead. You just worry about that necromancer.
There is something that has been bothering me. There was a traveler, a fellow Nord, who showed up asking all sorts of strange questions about the barrow. Haven't seen him since. There was just something off about him. I wonder if he went inside?
I'm here on the Ambassador's orders. I can't leave my post unless there's an emergency.
Would you rather I gnash my teeth and fall to the ground weeping?\n\nSome grief is too deep to show itself. I see her body before me, and though I will miss her very much, my life will go on.
I can't believe a blasted vampire actually got a decent cut in on me. But I was pretty busy trying to protect Janeve. \n\nThe House Tamrith sisters are both brave and good women. Please help Janeve if you can.
I've researched this a bit. Really, you need to be in three places at once. Simple, right?\n\nBut <<Ac:1>> is rumored to hold a relic of the Khajiiti thief god. For our purposes, <<2>> will serve as the divine spark. If it's truly there, of course.
Yes. Captain Janeve of the Rivenspire Guard. In fact, the Countess just sent the good Captain to investigate disturbing rumors from the western countryside.\n\nBut rumors are for later. We have a more immediate problem right here in Shornhelm.
Turenn is dead? You saw him? Oh gods!\n\nI—I needed him to get me out! The door can only be opened from the outside. I don't have enough supplies to last forever! I'll die in here!
We have enough. We found his boot prints in the mud outside the broken window. He was involved. I'm not sure he was alone, but he was there.\n\nIn fact, that friend of his, that Olivier—I suspect he may have helped with the robbery.
Really? She said that? I guess it's true. My plans for making gold haven't really panned out, have they? My poor mother, she's been wearing the same shawl for eight years ….\n\nAll right. If this is the best way I can help my family, I'll enlist.
I'm not sure. But there must be something here that we need. Why else would the two Ayleid outposts be linked as they are in the manuscript?\n\nFirst, however, we need a way to open the path down. Without that, this ruin is nothing but a dead end.
Of course! They say jewelry's the key to every woman's heart. \n\nI don't have much gold, but the blacksmith's apprentice, Khalisah. She said she could make a nice necklace if I could supply the gems.
I sent Skordo and a small group to establish a secure base among the farmhouses outside the city.\n\nHe's supposed to find a way into Northpoint and then send us a signal. Since that hasn't happened yet, I assume he's still working on it.
We push forward. Lleraya's veil is far from perfect, and she made it specifically to hinder me and my vampiric charges. \n\nShe wasn't expecting you, however. You should be able to guide us through the veil using the tears that litter the illusion.
Well, I guess that would be all right. \n\nI am a guard of the first order, a member of the Bloodtalon Cloaks of House Montclair. More than that, you won't get out of me.
Daisies make her sneeze? Why didn't someone tell me? How could we have missed this? I feel terrible.\n\nNow we'll just have to try something else. What do you think?
My drinking? By Mauloch, no! I hadn't had a drop in years until this happened. I quit a long time ago, after I woke up with a skinny little Wood Elf in my bed.\n\nAs for today, this is my last drink. Well, maybe one more.
Really? Write it myself? I never thought of that. \n\nI'm much better when I'm spontaneous. I'll just make something up as I go along. Yes. I'll just let it come from my heart and pour straight out of my mouth. Follow me.
Well, I bought this sleeping draught so I could sleep off this headache, but I guess I won't be napping now. \n\nTake it upstairs and find a way to distract Sagabar. Slip it into his drink. Then follow him into his room before he passes out.
I don't know. Whatever's down there was locked up for a reason. I just hope Arlie's safe.
No! I mean, yes! Not one of any note. She knew a few spells. I think Arlie's grandam taught her. But a Daedric prince!
To tell her how I felt. Ever since we were children, I've always thought she was special.\n\nIn my tenth year, I made her a cloak. A bearskin from a hunt her father took me on. Seeing it around her shoulders … it was wonderful.
A time of reaping, yes? Of preparing for the cold that fills the world.
Tell me true, if you really wish to pass. What is the season of iron gray? What is the cycle in which the world finally dies, at least for a time?
Skordo and his group should have set up a base in one of the nearby farmhouses.\n\nHis mission is to find a way into Northpoint and then send us a signal. Since we're still waiting, I assume he hasn't made it past the gates yet.
Montclair will strike when I'm distracted. You must keep me safe or we'll never reach Gwendis in time.\n\nOne more thing. Watch for an opportunity to destroy the statues. As long as they power the ward, my efforts will be less effective. Are you ready?
I know. It's silly. I just can't seem to believe in myself the way others do. And it's holding me back. I know it is!
It would seem so. This one cannot imagine the value of such a thing. Too shiny, and dripping with pride. \n\nJust the same, we must warn him. And the guild. Aelif will go after Merric. Return to Sees-All-Colors. Tell her what you have seen. Go!
The Star-Gazers consists of scholars who are no match for the current threat. We need champions to face the Warrior, the Mage, and the Serpent. And, if possible, to find the Thief.\n\nJoin us. Be our strong arm, our sharp sword against the Celestials.
<<1>> is trying to break into the mine. We've got people trapped in there. And we need to understand what in Oblivion the Reachmen are up to!
The Guild is an organization dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. We travel the width and breadth of Tamriel, seeking out books, tomes, and ancient scrolls.
Orsinium used to be the Orc homeland. Breton and Redguard kings have a nasty habit of burning it to the ground.\n\nNow the Covenant will solve all our problems? You give them the relic, they'll use it to keep Orcs in line. If not now, then one day.
Parquier probably dropped it near the river. It's not that far. Just head toward the mountains and you'll run right into it. Maybe you'll find his shoes while you're out there, too.\n\nIn any event, I'm grateful for your help.
Take this torch. Use it on the bodies of the soldiers while I perform the ritual of sanctification.
Excellent. I hearby grant you the rank of Student in the Mages Guild. I am sure will do the guild proud.\n\nYou will earn status within the guild for every book you find, or collection completed. Good luck!
Hah! Either you know more than you're admitting, or you know nothing at all! I won't be the one to slake your thirst for knowledge. Oh, no.\n\nYou did ask for news, however. And the Wilderking is news to me.
Oh come now, you must have seen one.\n\nThe Anchors are the most recent Daedric horror unleashed on us by our friends in Oblivion. Huge chains fall from the sky, then hundreds of Daedra pour out. It's actually kind of impressive, in a scary way.
Yes, but I need your help. You must climb the tower further and place the Wilderking's crown in the gardens there.\n\nThen you must wait for me. Promise you'll wait.
Docents discover and bring us rare tomes and scrolls. Through their efforts, our libraries grow.\n\nIn exchange, a docent is entitled to purchase items restricted to guild members. Docents may also be offered occasional special tasks ….
To hunt and to seek are not always the same. A flower does not hunt the sun. And so it is with us. The Guild does not care about wars, battlefields, or boundaries—just wisdom. Any books you acquire will improve your reputation with the Mages Guild.
You certainly are an inquisitive one, aren't you? \n\nIf you must know, Ornis lets me use his equipment. Until I can set up a shop of my own.
The Fading Tree chooses. It guides us towards the next caretaker. Not everyone has the courage, intelligence, and fortitude to undertake this position.\n\nEveryone from the village knows how hard it can be, and yet nearly everyone wants to do this.
Did she? Well, I suppose I do.\n\nThere are a few additives I require, but I can't very well walk away from my table while Dethisam and the rest of the townsfolk need my skills. Even this interruption can prove disastrous where alchemy is concerned.
By the look of his scars, he's seen his share of battle, and he knows how to take a beating. Don't expect him to go down quickly. \n\nThere's a shaman who's never far from his side as well. I'd focus on killing the shaman first. Good luck.
There are torchbugs in my eyes ….
Vanus Galerion, one of the founding members of this august body. Still holds the proud title of Guildmaster, overseeing every guildhall in Tamriel. He works with other ranking members, such as Telenger the Artificer, to ensure our future success.
This is not Andur's story. We're here to help Aranias. Whatever you've done in your own tale does not affect these characters.
A resource for slave chattel, of course! Goblins take quite a lot of educating before they come around. It's worth it, though. They're a highly valued commodity. \n\nI once sold a whole tribe to a vizier in High Rock. Made a prince's ransom in coin!
Pray for me. I can hear the skalds. Singing the songs of Sovngarde. \n\nMy ancestors … I can almost see their faces.
The Nedes apparently followed a variety of customs and religious practices, adapting to whatever invaders were currently overwhelming them.\n\nOne of these customs was star-worship. The Skystone amulet was a symbol of the priestly office.
Well, I'm not one of their recruitment liaisons, but I can tell you a little. They claim to be an altruistic organization, formed to help the common people of Morrowind.
We're from here, and go there. It's hard to describe.\n\nI actually don't give it all that much thought. I'm sure you'll find many others feel the same way. Why worry about it when our visits happen so smoothly?
Right! Things aren't so different, are they? Only difference is we come and go. Others stay in one place.\n\nDo you see the flagstones about? My great-great-grandfather helped place them when he was a lad, and our family's maintained them ever since.
Yes, thank you. And I feel better, as well. I guess I really didn't have the Llodos plague after all.
I wouldn't rule it out, but I haven't had time to look into their claims. You're free to investigate, but be wary of a trap. The Serpent could simply be baiting us.\n\nLast I heard, the women were still at the Crossroads Tavern here in Belkarth.
Dethisam provided them with the old graveyard key when they first arrived, and I've seen Maulborn coming and going through the back gate.\n\nIf we go to the back gate, I'm sure we can get one of the Maulborn to let us inside.
This is a gathering of the Undaunted, and you're about to become one of us! Hope your ears are ready to bleed ….
Very clever! Yes, a riverbank!\n\nWould you like to hear another? It is too good to miss, and I need the practice.
This one is thinking of riddles, which makes me very busy inside.\n\nIt is somewhat lucrative, though I must practice them first. Would you stay and listen?
Well, get on with it then. You make that uniform look good, but I still don't have anything to drink here.\n\nJust be careful in there. No matter what you're wearing, if they catch you swiping the jarl's wine, they'll toss you out on your pretty arse.
These trials were placed here centuries before us. The secrets of their workings are hidden even to the masters of the school. \n\nIt was the founder's will that the teachings of the school should last, even when there was no master left to oversee it.
Deep within our sanctuary, others have unleashed a force beyond their control. Lead me to the door, if you dare to enter.
Indaenir will know better. You came in together, so this one assumes you are already acquainted, yes?\n\nHe is strange—even for a Bosmer—but Akkuz-ri has never met an Elf who understands nature so well. Come though. Let us consult with him.
Too slow for my liking. My advisor Borodin is at the inn, asking questions of the townfolk. My court mage, Golun, has a theory about the Worm Cult's plan. He's at the Mages Guild, doing research.\n\nPerhaps you can give them a hand?
We only raise our blades in service to the guild. We're neutral in the war between the three Alliances. Some of us follow the Lion banner and King Emeric, of course. But every race, every creed, belongs under the Guildhall's roof.
Excellent question! We train our members in special techniques. And the higher-ups are always looking for motivated members to help with special projects. You never know when the Council will come looking for more hands.
Pah! There are no bandits. You are listening, but you do not hear!\n\nThis one should have known better than to ask. What a waste of time!
Shoulda known you for a dry-cap. See if I keep your steps shadowed!
Those enormous chains descending from the sky? A passage opens to Oblivion, and Daedra boil out to lay waste to the countryside. I don't know who started calling them Daedric Anchors, but it fits.
We started our research here. Figured it was less dangerous than the crypts. Everything seemed fine at first. People kept drinking the water though. Thought nothing of it.\n\nIt started with the strange whispering. Then the hostility.
Squan was a genius. The man always knew how to conjure up just the right spell. Master of conjuration and all things, I watched him summon up atronachs to do with as he pleases.\n\nOut of all of us, I thought he'd be the last to succumb to the curse.
Stuhn blesses you with his wisdom and vision. For a generous contribution in his name, the God of Ransom, Fraternity, and Justice will grant you the power to revisit your choices regarding Skills.
Kyne blesses you with her wisdom and vision. For a generous contribution in her name, the Goddess of Storm will grant you the power to revisit your choices regarding Attributes.
Of course! We provisioners practice the arts of cooking and brewing. \n\nGood food requires the best ingredients. We gather fresh meat and produce from crates, barrels, and the like. If we're lucky, we'll also find recipes in chests, trunks, and desks.
Don't forget drink! \n\nHearty meals will fill your belly, increasing your general well-being—both body and soul. Strong drink can stimulate the humors, allowing you to recover more quickly.\n\nIf you're lucky, you might find a recipe that does both!
You bet. A true blacksmith can read the metal to determine its potential. During the forging process we can choose a trait that best fits the item—provided we've done our research. Additional sharpening, extra weight … these are just examples.
Well, the piece can be improved even more through the use of tannins. These elements can enhance the value and quality of your work. Just be cautious. You risk ruining the piece if you're not careful. Improving on perfection is no mean feat!
Certainly! Woodworkers shape wood into all manner of useful tools, but bows, staves, and shields are our specialty. This work requires fine lumber and a sturdy work table.\n\nWe also seek out style books and rare ingredients for more advanced work.

Yes, of course. During the tailoring process, we can choose a special trait for the work. It takes research to discover these techniques, but it's well worth the effort. Reinforced buckles, intricate detail work … each brings a special benefit.
We tan, weave, stitch—you name it. People in search of medium and light armor come to us. This requires fibers, leather, and a work table like those found in town.\n\nWe also seek out style books and special ingredients for more advanced work.

Glyphs are assembled by combining three different runes. \n\nPotency runes determine the glyph's strength. Aspect affects the glyph's quality. Finally, the Essence rune decides the glyph's effect.\n\nIt's a delicate art best learned by doing. Good luck.
Well, not just any water will do. You'll find that some pools of water contain special qualities that make them ideal for potion-making. The grade of the water determines the potency of the product.
Once you've copied the recipe down and acquired the necessary ingredients, that's when the real fun begins. Cooking pots and rotisseries can be found all over. You need only find one, select a recipe, and then indulge in the simple joy of cooking!

It says the people of the city worshiped her in a temple that was once dedicated to the stars.\n\nThere's a third wing across the way. I assume that's the temple wing, and I'd guess that Shada's in there.
Feels foolish, asking you to risk your life when all I have to offer is a thank you. But you have to understand how much this means to us. And to Craglorn.\n\nI wish you luck. We'll remain here and wait for your return.
I'm not one to speculate on the powers of the Celestials, but it seems he manipulated the Mage somehow.\n\nThat's not in our power to correct at the moment, but we can try to find this new atronach—an air atronach, the monarchs called it.
We did. It didn't contain what Tarish-Zi hoped for. So he ordered it buried out of spite. It should be directly below us, if memory serves.\n\nI noted some Nedic remnants jutting from a nearby lake. I'm certain they're part of Reinhold's Retreat.
Now is not the time for friendly chatter. You must harvest the elemental infusions from the shards so we can force our way into the staff.
The Serpent uses these crystals to siphon the Mage's power for his own use and to gather a stronger hold over her aspects.
We've had to put all our considerable resources into researching the Celestial threat. The Star-Gazers are capable scholars, certainly. But they lack the requisite literature. This work has kept us very busy.
She is magic incarnate. The Great Source paled in the face of her power, and in her presence, it shattered.\n\nIt was the greatest day of our lives. The Learned One has worked magic within these walls like no spell that has ever been achieved before.
Let me stop you right there. I did not summon the atronachs. Not alone, anyway.\n\nI had the help of three other mages: Adalind, Dorian, and Kasimir.
I don't want to think about it. It wasn't even a battle. It was slaughter. I don't know when I blacked out, but when I woke, the Iron Orcs had joined their victims in death.\n\nStanding above me was a solitary figure, hand outstretched. Hara.
I charged across Tamriel to get to Craglorn when I heard that the fabled Hel Ra Citadel had finally opened its doors. Any Redguard worth their sword would, to get a chance to see a piece of old Yokuda.\n\nI still hope to get the chance.
It depends where you need to go. This is a working ship. We don't traverse all of Tamriel's seas.
Then you know <<1>> is a dangerous man with wealth and connections. Most everything on this island happens with his approval.
Ha! She threatened to kill me. I try to remember the faces of people who do that.
Then may the mistress guide your hand.\n\nYou'll certainly need some higher power to watch over you in there.
One night, when <<1>> had already worked a triple shift, and thus was taking a well-deserved rest belowdecks, we aboard the Bountiful Mara, encountered the Crimson Ship!\n\nYou do know about the Crimson Ship?
I vowed that I would always face my opponents as an equal. If an enemy came at me with a sword, I would meet his blade with one of my own.\n\nThe harpies fight with claws. How could I go up against them with anything more than the fists nature gave me?
Some of this, some of that. Enough to keep food in our bellies and grog in our mugs.
That's some good news at least. You have my thanks. Now to see if I can get back to my squad, or what's left of it.
Nerien'eth believes that I wronged him. I don't understand why.\n\nEverything he's done here is some kind of sick retribution. He said so when he killed me, my students. He says so now, as he captures their souls.
Nerien'eth anchored our souls to this plane when he slayed us, but I am fairly certain we can find a way to pass on.\n\nFor the moment, the students are just happy to be free from torment and battle with Daedra.
No, no—that wasn't me. That was someone else. I'm The Rat, you see? I didn't even know the Emperor before he died.\n\nAnd now, well, The Rat and the Emperor don't really get along anymore.
Toss her corpse in a trunk, seal yourself in the coffin, and wait for her comrades to carry you out.\n\nWhen he leans down to kiss his dear sister for the last time, you burst out and stab him in the throat!
Oh very well. You caught this one with your amazing perception. But admit it, Senamu's commitment to the lie was impressive, yes? \n\nAh! It feels good to clear the air! Now, this one has thieving to get back to. Stay fragrant, five-claw!
We need to reach the spawning pools and slay the progenitor mantikora. Once the creature is killed, the Scaled Court won't be able to create more of these monsters.\n\nAnd if any of their prisoners are still alive, we should set them free.
Ah, now that's one gift I won't refuse. I think I can take a few more bouts before I really need it, but I know that time will eventually come.\n\nThank you, stranger. Now I know I can overcome whatever they send my way.
Because the miner was always taking him for granite!
I left Sentinel to aid the common folk against the rising threat of Craglorn. Once here, Arkay led me to the catacombs. He warned me of an awakening evil that everyone else was too occupied to see.
The runescriber's an artist! He carves intricate designs right into the flesh. Between his own talent and the addition of the nirncrux dust, his body decorations make the trolls more dangerous than usual.\n\nHe works on the west side of the valley.
Why wouldn't we? We're Dorzogg's Dozen and we're ready for anything!
Now you're catching on! Ha! Where do you figure my other six knights are? Sneaky, sneaky ….
Of course! Our patrons have been very generous.
He doesn't always know when a fight is socially acceptable. And he's always ready for a battle.\n\nSometimes he attacks a block of wood. Or a rock. Maybe some livestock. Other times … well … you don't want to be near Holstagg at the wrong time.
He's expressed interest. I think. It's hard to tell. Holstagg isn't much of a conversationalist.\n\nI'd actually prefer he stayed out of there. We could use the gold, but I don't want to see him hurt anyone. He always feels bad when he hurts someone.
I have always been a scholar. When I joined the Scaled Court, they put my skills to best use and had me study these ancient ruins.\n\nI studied carvings, read fragments of manuscripts, examined aged relics … all to learn what I could about the Nedes.
No, soldiers like you killed them. The cultists just didn't want the meat to go to waste, I guess.\n\nA squad of soldiers attacked our guards and freed us. We all scattered and I stumbled onto this place. And I am never leaving.
They were, weren't they! I laughed so hard when you poked my giant friend! He really sent you sailing!\n\nI'm glad to see you're interested in the upcoming games. I couldn't think of anyone more suited to compete. Good luck, my friend
I suppose getting kicked over a wall by a giant might not be a memory to cherish.\n\nBut you did me a favor long ago, and I remember it well. That's all you need to know. That, and I believe you have a chance to win these games. Fight well, my friend.
Of course. What do you want to know?
Well, let's be honest—those savages aren't guild scholars. The second we catch wind of an attack, I send these brick-skulled mutts into the bushes. We hit them with a hail of arrows and finish off the stragglers with axes and flails. Simple.
Every race has a traditional material they work into their weapons and armor.\n\nFor example, the Imperial style material is nickel. I should know—every day in the legion camps, I worked a pile of it.
I came here to try to hold on to the memory of my wife, but the realization of her death … it's almost too much to bear!
Our parents died when the Xivkyn monster broke into our home. My sister spat on Gati and called her horrible names. Gati made an example of her but kept her alive, until the end.\n\nGati finally went too far and Claudia died. Then they dumped us here.
The crew did not form so that we could own manors, or barter for a seat on the Imperial Council. We formed to explore, to have fun. Why not share in our bounty, in our good fortune?
This one has no children, but <<1>> and <<2>> are like sons.\n\nBoth were rescued from Daedric torturers. <<1>> has recovered but <<2>> suffered greatly and may never be the same.
Watch for it when you're roaming the wilderness, especially in grassy areas. It has a distinctive yellow flower that's hard to miss, once you've seen it.
I know of a cache outside this town. It is a rare exception for runes to be clustered so close together, so thank whatever gods you worship.\n\nShould the runes be absent, you must search further afield.
Bring any item with a trait to the appropriate crafting station and research it. You'll lose the item in the process, but you'll learn the trait.\n\nThe more traits you already know for an item, the longer new traits take to research. Plan accordingly!
Ah! So you've met them. I really do feel awful about what happened.\n\nI offered my help because I suspected that the ruins of Mzindyne were down here, but I never expected such powerful defenses. This place is remarkable!
I have been called to restore the Orsimer to our true destiny. To revive the ancient traditions. The ideals of truth, honor, and unity. \n\nThis is Trinimac's will and desire. I have my part to play, and you have yours.
What can I say? It's a gift. I have extensive experience navigating Dwemer ruins, and I've learned the blindspots and weaknesses of the animunculi over the years. \n\nOr perhaps I'm just very lucky. I don't actually care to know which.
They say Urfon has ice in his veins. That he can freeze an Orc's blood with the flick of his wrist. Probably an exaggeration, but we should be careful.\n \nEither way, between the two of us, I'm certain we can beat him.
Hmm. Vicious things. Orcs, but not Orcs.\n\nOld, but … not.
The thing is … Oozrul's feat was even more impressive because he killed the trolls with his head! They called his helm "Slime Spiller" because it was stained with troll brains.\n\nIf I could bring that helm back to Orsinium, I'd be hailed as a hero!
I know. I know. You've done enough already, but this would mean so much to me. \n\nOozrul's tomb is sealed by some confusing mechanism, and I thought maybe … just maybe … you could figure it out and get the helm for me.
He asks that you seek him out at our home, Fharhun Stronghold. He would not share fully his thoughts with me, but in truth I worry for my husband. He does not beg, but he demanded I do anything necessary to convine you to come.
Spill the blood of innocents and blame the king for their deaths. For not being able to protect his people. What a fiendish scheme. \n\nBut the king sent you in his stead. Very astute on his part. That decision may have saved many lives.
Eh—scattered now. Some serve the Pact. A few struck out to build a new clanhold. Most settled in Skyrim and Morrowind with the Nords and Dunmer, though. Farming and such. \n\nI've got no patience for that sort of thing.
At first maybe. But then I thought, curse or no curse, with the hammer destroyed the clan will have to move on. One way or another.\n\nIt was … liberating.
She did not! By the Eight … the nerve of that woman! \n\nHow could she just abandon me like this? I'm all alone. Who's going to clean this place?
Every moment, the spirit of High Kinlord Rilis jeers and plays tricks on me.\n\nHe haunts these walls—and I am his Keeper, his warden. The only one left. Rilis has swayed the other Keepers to his side, and plans to attack Tamriel from his prison.
Now that's a thing to brag about. Did he start bawling like a whelp once he learned we mortals know a thing or two about pain?
Soon as I get up the courage, I'm going to make a run for it. Try to get out of the city and back to Fort Aleswell and my parents. They'll be happy to see me again, I'm sure. If they're still alive and still in the village.
I left Porcia and our children here, in our house. The soldiers next door said they'd protect them. My friend Thracius and I stole out of the city, took a boat across Lake Rumare. Then we headed west, to Chorrol.
You're right. It has to be done. It has to.
Are you daft? It's the big chair at the back of the room! The Empress Regent will sit there when we've won the Tower, like her predecessors before her.\n\nYou really need to get out more. See the world. "What is the Ruby Throne?" Outrageous.
She has called on my order many times.\n\nThe Clivia Tharn of recent days is not the woman I knew. We must find her. Daedric invasion or no, there will be a struggle for the Ruby Throne without an Empress Regent. And that would mean … more blood.
The head of the Empress's Elder Council. He's apparently been captured by the Daedra, and they're making a spectacle of his torture in the Arena.\n\nSomeone like you might be able to rescue the poor fool. If you wish to do so, talk to Jagar Lovidicus.
No. I did my time though. Served for several years under Emperor Varen, but the legions aren't what they once were—they've been corrupted.\n\nI retired and accepted a post as a guard at the Temple. I suppose I'll be retiring from that now too.
Well, I'll be damned. I wasn't sure it could be done. I actually suspected I was sending you to your death. I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nThis is terrific. I can't wait to tell my grandfather.
I'm withholding judgment until I complete my analysis of the pure specimens from the necrotic sacs.
Until they're all dead or the arrows run out. I think the latter's more likely. When that happens … well, I guess we'll take our chances with rope and knives. \n\nKind of tempting actually. These traitors deserve that personal touch.
I am your dearest and truest friend! I just know you'll make a fine addition to our organization. But is there something else I can do for you right now? I do have places to go and things to … acquire, if you take my meaning
A bounty on your head can be difficult to live with. As long as the bounty remains in force, the Guard will hunt you down.\n\nAnd when they catch you, you have only two options: pay your bounty and relinquish your stolen goods, or attempt to flee.
Try fleeing to the nearest refuge. That's usually what I do. If you can't get away, the Guard usually give you an opportunity to pay your fine.\n\nEnforcers give you nothing but an axe in the guts. Best to avoid them.
Sometimes you acquire something that's just too good to part with. However, if the Guard finds you with a stolen item, you're back in hot water. But the fence knows how to turn an illegal item into an item that's free and clear.
We're a group that the city Guard in towns across Tamriel have contracted to help in the keeping of the peace.\n\nThere's a book that explains it all, around here somewhere.
The provost at the Enforcers chapter will pay for anything you've confiscated from criminals.\n\nNow, the Guard funds are not unlimited. You might have to wait a bit before the money frees up.
I was struck by an arrow. Don't be fatuous.
The Lord Warden! Those Twilights—all claws and curses! \n\nAll I did was steal a loaf of bread, you see? No harm done. I was almost out of the prison … the guards had signed my release. By the Eight, they'd signed it!
Once it's done, get moving. The Prophet will know where to go, but he'll need your eyes, and your protection.
In days of old, the Dragons ruled the world through their powerful servants, the Dragon priests. Now that I think about it, this could depict the time of the Dragon War.\n\nLet's find more of these remarkable images and see what else they can tell us.
Some Orcs have a fondness for foreign culture. We don't have any love poems, but I enjoy the sonnets of the Redguard poet, Borasad. He's visiting Wrothgar now.\n\nAnd I noticed that Rigurt thinks hunt-wife Yatzog smells good. See what perfume she uses.
I first encountered the phenomenon back in Glenumbra. Oh, the ones back there were a little different, but Reach magic is Reach magic.
Reach magic invades nature the way a plague violates an infirm body.\n\nIt changes its host, taking hold and letting its corruption grow stronger. It creates defenses, barriers that can't be easily overcome. It needs to be weakened before we lay siege.
Of course I can. I do it all the time. And I'll have you know that I'm right about fifty percent of the time!\n\nFine, fine, we'll do things your way. But I'm going to keep an eye on those two.
Isn't it obvious? Look at their evil demeanor, their villainous whispering. I bet if we rattle them, they'll run off and lead us right to the hostages!\n\nWatch. I'll just let loose an arrow. That should put the fear of Y'ffre into the survivor!
You're just like the others. Seems the only person who believes me is my husband.\n\nBut he's an idiot, so what he thinks doesn't prove a thing.
I know it sounds strange, but the Riekrs behaved like a raiding party. I even saw their leader bark commands in some gibberish language.\n\nIf I don't salvage this, make things right, I'll bring shame to my mother. She's the hunt-wife of our clan.
They headed toward the cave up in the cliffs the last time I saw them. Right after that Riekr got the drop on me.\n\nShould've been back by now. Maybe you can find them? I'll make my way back to the camp. As soon as my ears stop ringing.
You met Avreg, did you? We look nothing alike, but he's the best brother I've ever had.\n\nI was trying to find the other hunters when Winks decided to go exploring without me. Stupid cat isn't afraid of anything. Hey, wait a moment. Who are you?
No. I am forever leashed to my mortal shell. Already my perfect children grow deaf to my call.\n\nEnd it, then. Close the pressure valve sustaining me and free me from this withered cage.
Point down
Well, mostly. I did almost get caught that last time. Scared the leaves off my tree, if you catch my meaning. I dove down here to hide and wait for you to arrive.\n\nWorked a lot better in my head, truth be told.
As soon as I start the process, poison will begin filling the room and those cell doors are going to swing open.\n\nI'll try to be quick, but with an injured arm, I can only work so fast. Just keep the prisoners away from me and stay out of the gas.
You have an annoying habit of focusing on the negative aspects of a situation, do you know that?\n\nLook, the sphere didn't kill anyone. I think it came here to help.
Ah, my apologies. I couldn't reveal anything until you said the proper words.\n\nTake the stairs down into the storage area. Look for an opening in the wall. It leads to our most private set of rooms.
Since you're paying for it, I don't see why not. It's good, strong stuff.
We had precious little warning that the pack was coming, but it was enough. We set up traps to slow or even kill the invaders. Rock falls, spikes, bear traps, that sort of thing.\n\nTread carefully in there.
The moot? No, our warriors are already in place. When the chiefs attend the moot, we will eliminate them and bring unity to our people.\n\nInstead, I want you to join the warriors heading to the inn. Help them capture Bazrag before he can escape again.
Does that justify what you've done? Does that make you feel better?\n\nI thought Bazrag was bad. That Solgra betrayed us. But you … you're worse than either of them. Would you sacrifice me, too? No … don't answer that.
I admit I never trusted you. But you've helped our people. You deserved better than to fall to the forge-mother.\n\nI dragged you back here before the Vosh Rakh arrived, healed you as best I could. Now get out of here before the soldiers find you.
The chiefs have already headed to the moot and Vosh Rakh guard the keep. If you want to survive, you have to leave now.\n\nI don't want to fight you, but if you decide to go after the king … well, I am sworn to protect my beloved.
Yes, he's the Orc opposite Shinji—which is why this can't be <<1>>'s resting place.\n\nThough venerated by Wrothgar's Orcs, Baloth was little more than an opportunist. Why would an Orc mercenary's tomb honor the Redguard who "murdered" him?
Yes … yes, I'm all right. Just need to catch my breath. You have my deepest, deepest thanks. I only wish more could have been saved.
Just down the path here. He found what looks to be an old smuggler's bolt hole in the rocks.\n\nSkordo sent me back so I could tell you all about it. He's waiting for you over there.
In this tomb are the items I used to win over <<1>>'s trust.\n\nReturn each to its proper home, so you may return to yours.
I'm well aware of that! I'm counting on the start of the moot to keep them distracted, but I won't take any unnecessary chances.\n\nBesides, I was supposed to be dead by now.
Trinimac will reward my service!
You're going to let me live?\n\nThe forge-mother was right. You are a coward. There's no iron in your spine. You can't win, outsider. Trinimac is on our side, after all.
Not much. They're rather secretive, keep to themselves. They apparently wear masks whenever they gather. And I've heard rumors. They've been linked to trouble in the west. \n\nThis sect is rather new, from what I've been given to understand.
Oh, did he now? How typical.\n\nIf that lech has a fiance, then I'm the Queen of Daggerfall! That pendant is mine. It even has my initial engraved on the back. It was a gift from my parents. It turned up missing shortly before the storm.
Really? Why, that's ridiculous! Who would … oh. You spoke to Azeeda, didn't you?\n\nListen, she's just upset. We had a few intimate moments during the voyage, but she wanted more than I could give her. This is just her way of punishing me.
Well, not exactly. Those expensive engineers I hired built in override timers on the locks. If you don't close the valves fast enough, the trap resets.\n\nWe built it to hamper escape attempts, remember? It's not supposed to be easy.
It is not. All that matters is what the <<1>> represents.\n\nMalacath demands strength … despises weakness. The relic is a symbol for his followers, a holy mandate. This is why the Winterborn must never recover it.
Because you're not an idiot. You're not an idiot are you? Sorry.\n\nI'm looking into a plot. The plot. Molag Bal is looking for something. Something powerful. I fear that if we don't find out what it is, we'll all pay dearly.
We all are.\n\nBut that's barely relevant at this point. Let's focus on the Daedra, all right?
It's the thin air up here. But whatever you did made the weather calm down, so we followed you up. That's when Kharsthun and Lady Laurent started arguing.\n\nKharsthun thinks the shrine would be a better location to display the Armlet than the museum.
Yet he still remains. You should have finished the job.
Apparently, the Sublime Brazier is a relic the emperors use to light the Dragonfires—those mystical flames that keep the Daedra from entering our world. \n\nBut it doesn't make sense. The Dragonguard should know about this—should be protecting it.
Are you the king's social secretary? No? Didn't think so.\n\nMy appointment is my own business. You should mind yours. Now leave me alone or I'll call the guard!
No, you can't help. Either he shows up or he doesn't. But what's wrong with you? Do you always stick your nose into other people's business?\n\nSorry, sorry. I get surly when people are late for appointments.
In my pocket, of course! That's why I think I was pickpocketed!\n\nLook, I understand you're trying to help, but there's nothing you can do. Just leave me alone! I just … I just have to think.
Even the unworthy want to bend before the mighty Malacath!\n\nMalacath is the god of curses and the betrayed, the protector of the Orcs and the provider of the code. For every broken promise, he gives us battle. For every grudge, he gives us blood!
Well, it's a bleak world out there. I hope you'll forgive me if I'm not all sunshine and butterflies. I can't remember the last time I saw the sun, and I don't think I even remember what a butterfly looks like.
Kurog dreamed of a united Orsimer nation. Of all Orc clans standing shoulder to shoulder as equals with the other races.\n\nDespite everything that happened, I think he's going to get his wish.
Fascinated would be a better word. How did it happen? How is the scroll involved? Why is our immortality limited to this building, at this time?\n\nSo many questions. Answering them could take years. I only hope I have the opportunity.
Lucky, I guess? And worried. What if it's permanent? I welcome any chance to take these Daedra down a peg, but I don't think anyone wants to live forever. If nothing else, you'd get bored. Right?\n\nStill, I'll fight as long as my captain needs me.
I'll give you a bottle of Kurog's favorite ale. I'll give you a whole damn barrel of the stuff!\n\nBut only if you let me attend his funeral. I want to honor him. Say goodbye. Let me do that and I'll make sure you have plenty of the ale he loved.
The Vosh Rakh? No, I do not adhere to their misguided attempt at worship.\n\nI am a true priest of Trinimac, blessed by the holy sword Penitent and favored of the warrior god!
Antidotes, potions, herbal remedies … anything I can scrounge up. It's not pleasant. If the corruption doesn't kill me, these remedies will.\n\nThat only gets me so far, though. It's really about willpower. And even that has limits.
Some exiled Nords came to our land centuries ago and built the barrow to honor their powerful skald king. Or was he a conquering warlord? A renegade necromancer? I never remember that part!\n\nAnyway, whoever he was, they buried him in the barrow.
We'd be going in unprepared. I try to avoid that whenever possible.\n\nWe need to read this message from The Rat and allow time for Egnatius to decipher the scroll. Captain Caudex did mention sending some of his people ahead to prepare defenses though.
Sent her in with a squad of Orcs to deal with the harpy nests on the towers. Figured if the nests were on fire, the distraction would allow another squad to get in and put an end to the briarhearts.\n\nBut both groups have disappeared without a trace.
Of course.
Of course I am. Caudex insisted at first. I think he was trying to be chivalrous … or something. Because I'm a woman, I mean. He's an idiot. Anyway, he'd go mad within a week. Too much of a people-person. \n\nI'm the obvious choice.
Looks that way.\n\nWe did good work, you and I, but it's far from over. The city is still overrun, and without me there to leave severed heads on cultists' doorsteps, it might get worse. Look after the people. Eight know they can't do it themselves.
Pardon my intrusion. I assure you, I do not seek to meddle in your alliance's affairs. I am looking for a compatriot of mine. She'd be dressed as I am. Reclusive… a bit abrasive at times. Have you seen her?
Eager? \n\nI'll be happy for the master, of course, but just between you, me, and the endless void, the Barons Who Move Like This are not the easiest Daedra to coexist around. Haughty. Demanding. And they don't have much respect for tutors.
Her work seems to be going well, but it's a long process. She has the patience of a stone statue! I don't know how she can stand dealing with all those rules and regulations.\n\nMe? I'm taking a long break in this comfortable tavern.
Ha! Yeah, that was a hoot and a half!\n\nBut enough with the reminiscing. It's time to make some new memories! And this land of Orcs and ice has plenty of adventure for both of us. I'm sure we'll run into each other again sometime.
It is a beautiful piece, crafted of delicate gold and inscribed with my lovely Alani's initial on the back.\n\nThere is not another like it for a thousand and a thousand leagues!
The Dragon priest mask! An early one, no less. I was sure there would be one here. All that digging through old tomes and scrolls was not in vain. It will be a crowning glory in my collection.\n\nCouldn't have done it without you!
It was not … oh, all right, Perhaps my initial investigation caused a bit of a problem. But now that the Dragon priest has been vanquished, the problem will take care of itself. \n\nAll's well that ends well.
"Great Phrastus, I find your books far superior to a festering boil on a troll's wangle."\n\nGood day.
Ah. You're the "associate" she mentioned in her missive, then? I had a feeling. It is a great pleasure to meet you. \n\nThis business with the Dragonfires is going to keep me very busy. But then, The Drake of Blades never made anything easy.
Ah, you know me so well! I am the great and powerful Narsis Dren! I came to this barrow to undo the damage I inadvertently caused and I have no intention of leaving the job half-finished!\n\nNow, let's get back to business, shall we?
That's … not what I've read.\n\nBut we can discuss this after the tomb is open.
Shabon? She's a brave young woman. Took an immediate interest in the High Elf and his fancy ways. The Elf didn't seem to mind. In fact, I think he liked having someone strong and beautiful at his side.\n\nYou find one and you'll find the other.
I had no idea it was the Blademaster himself! \n\nIn those days I sought to learn from anyone who knew how to wield a blade. He had a way about him … an inherent confidence in movement.
Search the area and see if you can find anything that even hints as to where the marauders disappeared to.\n\nIf you happen to pick up their trail, find Chief Bazrag. He'll know what to do.
I sent him after <<1>>, our laziest echatere. <<2>> can explain the task.\n\nHe's never been talkative, but see what you can learn as you aid each other. I'll want to speak with you when you return.
Malacath never forgets. Malacath never forgives.\n\nWe honor Old Orsinium's creation and scorn its fall. My order shows Malacath we will not repeat their mistakes.
Those who cannot unite against a common enemy will fall. Thus the fate of Old Orsinium. For this, they earned my scorn.\n\nBeyond are the guardians of my wrath. They will keep you from lighting my pyre.
Bazrag wants to start a war. Damn it all to Oblivion, we have to stop him!\n\nHe has the strength to overwhelm the lesser clans, and he's no suckling cub when it comes to fighting, either. If he were to make a challenge for my throne ….
Most books are being sent to capital. The great Orsinium Athenaeum was plundered during the second conquest. The Orcs have great pains to recapture some of that lost knowledge. I can hardly blame them.
This place is enormous! Besides, you never put all your acorns in one basket.\n\nWe need to find out what the Vosh Rakh are up to and fast. Flies and I will look around out here, while you and Tal see what the high-ranking cultists are meeting about.
Yeah, I was suddenly as naked as an ash tree that had lost its last leaf of the season. Good thing we stashed our gear nearby!\n\nAnyway, the temple attack was all to place the blame on Bazrag. The chief is innocent. I didn't help a murderer!
You're right. Only made it a hundred paces before it slammed into a tree.\n\nTook half a day to saw that bloody crest out. We tried to reattach the thing, but the echatere wanted nothing to do with it.
My beloved believes that this is the only way to accomplish his dream.\n\nAs his shield-wife, I will support him. Just as I always have.
An Orc should understand. Malacath walks in your shadow and burns in your blood. Survival is what our people must understand.\n\nBut you are blood-kin to our clan. This unpleasant task falls to me, and only to me. Shatul must survive.
I doubt that. An Orc of Shatul would truly understand. You are neither.\n\nYet you are blood-kin to our clan, and your words give me the strength to do what must be done. Shatul must survive.
Yes, the final touches are being added even as we speak. Repairs to the market stalls and main gates will make Orsinium a shining example of what a city should be.\n\nI just wish the king were still alive to see his dream come to fruition.
What? Of course it is. Every Orc, deep in their heart, yearns to be thrust into Malacath's coals. To see their grudges and fury folded and hardened on the Anvil of Ash!
I don't know … poison, ritual sacrifice, time when she slipped away from the clan. Anything that connects her to Boethiah.
I'm a priest of Trinimac and I always will be, whether we have a temple of our own or not.\n\nThese people, they've become my family. I'll stay and help the new king for as long as he needs me. And if I happen to give a few sermons, who can blame me?
Arrgh. Not your fault. Something about this mountain—like it's possessed. Doesn't want us up there.\n\nBut to Oblivion with that! If I want to climb a damn mountain, I'm gonna climb it! No pile of rocks is going to tell me what to do.
There's so much I want to tell you. To thank you for. I've learned so much from you. Out of everyone here, you're the one person I never lost faith in.\n\nI wish I could just go and follow you around forever.
I serve my <<1>>, as you serve <<2>>.\n\nBut … you don't exactly serve him, do you? Arakaul, wasn't it?
Oh, no. This was a special order. A custom job.\n\nI suppose it's less useful in your line of work. Duck feathers aren't going to turn a blade or deflect an arrow. Still, you won't find a finer garment! And handsome, to boot!
I am a Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood. I speak with the voice of the Night Mother. I act with the hands of our Dread Father, Sithis.\n\nI have an offer to make to one so skilled in the art of murder. An invitation, if you will.
Who knows why a young woman in the prime of her life would throw away everything to take up with a bunch of religious fanatics?\n\nI suppose it had something to do with that job that went sideways when I had to kill Josseline's best friend ….
Forward? Believe me, this is my shy and unimposing side. After all, we wouldn't want to give my beloved Cimbar the wrong idea, would we?\n\nFind me later and I'll show you what forward really looks like.
This just got much too serious for my taste, darling. Let's talk about something, oh, I don't know, more decadent. Like how I'd be nibbling on your ear if Cimbar wasn't here.\n\nHe's watching, isn't he? Maybe a little nibble is in order, hmm …?
Really, a—wait a moment! You're talking about Kireth, aren't you? She's the worst carpenter to ever heft a hammer, and that includes the drunk ones!\n\nI had to pay someone to fix what she repaired. She did more damage to my ship than the storm!
We're looking for a relic called <<Ac:1>>. We slip inside the treasure room, grab our prize, and depart before anyone knows the difference.\n\nAfter that, we split the proceeds and go our separate ways.
Hmm, I dislike them equally. <<1>> would keep it in his pocket. Were you subtle enough, you could take it from him.\n\n<<2>> would certainly leave it upon her bedroom dresser. Slip past her mansion's servants and house guards to retrieve it.
Nobody! Well … I sent word to the Thieves Guild of Abah's Landing. They were interested in acquiring <<Ac:1>>.\n\nAbah's Landing was to be our next stop. But why would this "Iron Wheel" set an ambush here? Are you certain you've never heard of them?
With what? They can't look to <<1>> for help. She hired the Iron Wheel to recover her dowry. When they did, she stopped funding them.\n\nAfter what we took from the Iron Wheel, they'll barely have enough to ship <<2>> to Taneth.
Let me see here … "and guest"! This is good, the invitation allows for a single companion.\n\nOnce you select your guest, you should visit the Diamond Thimble. If you aren't clothed in one of <<1>>'s outfits, you'll stand out like a sore claw.
You don't "have" to dress up … you "get" to dress up.\n\nBut your companion will need to acquire an outfit as well, so go on! I'll be over here.
Because I never sleep, I never stop moving, and I'm a born killer! Plus, my haircut kind of looks like a shark's fin.\n\nI run the best gang in Hew's Bane, handling protection, stolen goods, and what not. Or we will—once we get our grotto back.
Professional? No, my heart, it is nothing so cold. This is a vocation. To be a Cantor is to live a life of wine and prayer—full of dozing and bathing and joyful music.\n\nBeauty is too great a thing to be caged by profession, no?
Excellent. I learned something of my own—the palace is riddled with hidden passages. The palace is full of Iron Wheel sentries, so we may be able to use them as shortcuts.\n\nAnything else?
<<1>>, head of the Thieves Guild? You say he betrayed his own people to steal a dowry, for some mad plot to marry a noble of Taneth?\n\nIf you are bards sent by my cousin, your imaginations are sorely lacking. Why not say <<1>> rode a Dragon?
Mmm. Adara'hai is one of Azurah's purring daughters. On most nights, we Cantors lounge beneath the stars and sip Topal wine and sing the seventeen Khaj'ay Sahaalas. Other nights are … much less pleasant.
Of course.
I'm not entirely certain, of course—one can never be certain of these things—but I think I've discovered the location of a major relic. \n\nIf I'm correct, it belonged to <<1>>, founder of Orsinium, and creator of its Bear-Rider cavalry!
You'd tell my uncle? That's not very friendly of you.\n\nOh very well! I met a Khajiit woman in Riften, when I was drinking at the inn. She paid me to deliver the letter to the Dark Elf lady here. Never got the Khajiit's name, though. Sorry.
Oh very well. What's a few more moments when I get to spend it with a deadly assassin?\n\nWhat else would the Brotherhood like to know?
This one is no longer the young and brave Khajiit that fell in love with Velsa, and it took a long time to even discover she might be in Abah's Landing.\n\nNow I am old and my mind isn't what it once was. Velsa would never even recognize me.
Our sellers aren't official guild members, so they're only getting a cut of the earnings. You take too long or set off too many alarms and they're going to high tail it out of there.\n\nHazard pay isn't exactly included in their cut.
It's nothing.\n\nI … it's nothing.
No need for violence! You're as bad as the Iron Wheel, you know that?\n\nWell … not that bad.
<<1>> thought his plan to steal the dowry was "almost flawless." But "almost" won't bring our friends back.\n\nHe didn't have the right people for the job. But I do.
A secret passage? Velsa always loved secret passages! Let's go!
We'll be here. Bring him back safe and sound.
Take these letters. I don't want her family's agents to come looking for her yet, so I forged them to explain her absence. Just plant them in the Velmont Mansion and that will give me all the time I need.
Ah, you're the one that Walks-Softly brought to our charming little hovel.\n\nWell, let me be the first to welcome you to the Abah's Landing Thieves Guild. We may not look like much, but we used to be significant. Divines willing, we will be again.
Faradan helped me search and he found Tashmin in Skywatch, in far away Auridon. But bounty hunters have taken him prisoner, though he committed no crime. \n\n Faradan believes the bounty hunters are working for House Dres.
Well, she's no legend like Nicolas was. But then again, nobody is. We all miss him terribly.\n\nZeira, on the other hand, she's one of us. She isn't afraid to get her hands dirty. I appreciate that in my guildmaster.
A true genius never guesses. Not when every problem, no matter how complicated, can always be solved through dedication and analysis.\n\nI'll figure out who actually stole the dowry. It's just a matter of time.
I was biding my time, determining how best to perform my duties in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nBut as soon as I got the word that Zeira was re-forming the guild, I was back here in two shakes of a horker's tail.
Interfering foreign bastards! They have no business in Abah's Landing! If I had my way, I'd slip a vial of poison into the chief inspector's tea and be done with the matter.\n\n<<1>> says that's not the way we do things. More's the pity.
Somewhere in <<1>>. The Iron Wheel's preparations to depart causes much distraction. There is no better time to slip among their ranks!\n\nBut I am not a part of your guild. You would know best what to do, of course.
I shall tell you a secret. Once, crime was kept to a minimum by the Thieves Guild of Abah's Landing. But the Thieves Guild is no more, or so I have heard, and now the cutpurses and footpads run wild and free.\n\nSo, no. Not a safe place. Not at all.
Hmm. Excuse my attitude, but you have to understand. Cimbar ….\n\nAnyway, I've been hunting the Black Dragon. On my own. Got so close I could hear her voice. But I had to break off the hunt. I didn't want to wind up dead, you understand.
The Primate says regrets are as numerous as the stars in the sky and they shine brightest in the darkness.\n\nBut I don't want to talk about religion anymore, do you?
The Black Door will pose a question: "What is the flavor of fear?" Reply, "Sublime, my Brother," and the Sanctuary shall be opened to you.\n\nOnce inside, seek out Astara. She has additional instructions for you.
No, no. The guild has more interest in gold that still glitters. Old tunnels simply make for good shelter from prying eyes, unless they know where to look.\n\nThese recent arrivals are sure to have set snares and sentries, so waste no care on ghosts.
I'll need an explanation.\n\nAnd if I'm not satisfied, you can join "<<1>>" on the other side of the gate.
Inside this mausoleum. When they expanded the catacombs under the Cathedral some years back, the floor of this crypt collapsed. If you're squeamish, don't worry. Somebody was kind enough to relocate the bodies.\n\nI had no trouble expanding the hole.
Yes, the Anvil Lighthouse. Just up the way. The sender ordered me to direct you there after I handed over the letter.\n\nI'm glad I found you. After looking for the woman with the eye-patch all day, I figured I was in for a late night.
I prefer to convey my orders directly, so that nothing gets lost in the translation.\n\nYou know about the Order of the Hour? The religious warriors that protect the Kvatch Cathedral? They've expanded their mandate and now pose a threat I can't ignore.
Yes.
Very well.\n\nWe both know my part in what happened to the Thieves Guild. I won't beg for my life, if that's what you're expecting. If that's what <<1>> wants from me.
Ah, a ruse is it? You're not supposed to leave the Imperial City! I understand. Never fear, Emperor Varen, my lips are sealed.
I've never had a partner.\n\nI mean, on all the other big jobs I've done—which I did alone. Quite successfully. And most of the people I interviewed thought the rendezvous was too far away.
He can explain. It's the sort of work I'd normally turn down, but he always pays. And he stuck with us, even after the Iron Wheel's raids.\n\nHe's welcome to trade gold for worthless trinkets as long as he cares to do so.
You don't think it's strange the Iron Wheel knew exactly which nooks and crannies to plunder? They nicked most of our wealth and people in three days!\n\nThe dowry heist was bad luck for the guild. Shouldn't rob a tomb when there's fat pockets aplenty.
Our old guildmaster. A mentor, and a friend. He planned the dowry heist that would have seen us wealthy beyond our dreams.\n\nBut he's gone. I lost him in <<1>>'s family tomb. He is … sorely missed.
There should be guards throughout the homestead. We're looking for a gatehouse—once we're past the portcullis, the manor shouldn't be much further.\n\nThat's where we'll find the <<1>>.
Maybe I'm just that good?\n\nA few ink stains on my fingers, a furrowed brow and … three-hundred and three, three-hundred and four … could you not watch over my shoulder?
Twin, if you could believe it. I love her, but she drives me crazy. You would not believe how much she can spend on cosmetics. "Work related." Uh-huh. Half, maybe.
I'm not sure what to believe, but the Black Dragon certainly implies that in her journal.\n\nWhatever the case, only a master assassin could accomplish something as far-reaching as purification. The Black Dragon's skills clearly mark her as such.
We really couldn't afford to lose those ingots. Thank you. You have acted with honor and we'll do the same.\n\nInform Raynor he can come by and work on our forge. If he really can improve its operations, we'll compensate him fairly.
Nothing! Nothing!\n\nDuly noted! I promise never to make such implications again! Is there anything else you want to ask about before you start hunting the murderer?
That's excellent advice, friend! I'll stay in the market until closing time and then I'll head over to the Gold Coast Trading Company building. That place is built like a fort!
I met some of them when they came to accuse me of sending the threatening baked goods. As if I'm the only baker capable of making sweetrolls in the entire Gold Coast!\n\nThey ran. They hid. They avoided others. And then they died, each and every one.
You wound this one. What has Raz done to make you so wary?\n\nYou could hunt this killer on your own, but where's the fun in that? Raz helps you, you help Raz, and everything turns out well in the end. Let's continue this talk in private, though, yes?
Among the blackmail, I noticed the name <<1>>. He's a "claw-cutter"—a thief who robs other thieves. Wouldn't you know? He's signed on as our master of heists.\n\nNow, and don't strain yourself … who should you speak with next?
It was supposed to be a simple run. Pick up silks and spices on the way back to Vulkhel Guard and turn a tidy profit. But the Governor's taxes are going to bankrupt us.\n\nEven dead, that woman vexes our travels.
Already have one, hero. Raz wants the Wood Elf and I to stick close so he can watch out for us. We'll gather the rest of the targets and get them to safety.\n\nI'd prefer to let the killer find me and finish this, but the cat is very insistent.
Dozens. Hundreds! The problem with having so many ideas is that it's like these books behind me. They just pile up, and you can't possibly read all of them. So you read what you can and try to focus.\n\nThis might be why I'm not getting enough sleep.
Damn right, you do. She's crazy as a cracked mudcrab! All her talk about fate and the future. And what she said about me. I don't have a daughter. I hate children! It's never going to happen.\n\nAny way you look at it, Louna has to die.
I'm told that the target has a treasured pet named "Lucky." Pathetic sentiment. Our Dread Father has nothing but scorn for the tamed and the weak. Slay this beast in his name.
<<1>>. Just a poor fool who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He bumbled into a particularly heinous Sanguinary feast while the revelers were not wearing their masks.\n\nHe saw too much. Kill him.
Who do you think you are to question my actions? If you must know, Astara sent me. To look into the Order of the Hour's activities.\n\nSiege weapons, new recruits—they're building an army out here.
As blank as the stare in a dead man's eyes. But go ahead and see for yourself.\n\nI'm curious to find out if the Listener is right about you. If you can see what's really there.
There is a small house to the south. Near the Order of the Hour's Tower of Judgment. It's one of the only private buildings that's not along the main road.\n\nClearly the recipient of these notes must be hiding there. Raz can feel it in his whiskers!
That is fair! Raz feels the same way. Raz hates it when the little Elf tries to help with the Queen's daily riddle.\n\nWell, if you decide you need assistance, just ask. Otherwise, Raz will follow along and watch how your mind works.
Adventurers are overflowing in two things: interesting experiences and excess treasure. I get to follow along for a fraction of the risk and make a decent living saving you all the trouble of transporting goods.\n\nAlso, you tend to be very fit.
I wish I knew. I've studied the stars my whole life. I've heard them speak—but now they're silent. It's eerie. \n\nAll I know is when the Guardians disappeared, three powerful beings started attacking Craglorn. They call themselves the Celestials.
Thank you. We have a lot of work to do. But first, you must become an official member of our order.\n\nEnter the circle of stars and accept our blessing.
Prepare yourself!
We're all from the past. I'm just from … farther past.\n\nI can explain better what's going on if you free me and help me stop Tarish-Zi and the Anka-Ra. And maybe find me some clothes, as well.
Certain Nedic writings suggest this isn't the first time the Celestials have appeared in Craglorn. \n\nThey're legends mostly, but there's truth in them. They describe Apex Stones that connect the Celestials to Tamriel in some fashion.
The city lies in ruins and the Blackcaster mages run rampant over the corpses of the dead. Every moment that Yamanu-ko continues to draw breath is a moment wasted.\n\nBut I understand. This situation is far from normal.
Minerva was one of Arch-Mage Yamanu-ko's apprentices, but when the others went bad, she didn't. \n\nI can't imagine how many people would have died if Minerva hadn't intervened.
Even so, I have no right to gloat. If Zal'ik had taken my counsel, our people would have been slaughtered by the Yokudans.
I have thought long on whether and how the effects of the curse can be reversed.\n\nFor those whose flesh has rotted, there is no cure. But for those still in the early stages, I believe I have an answer, but I require something in return.
Feels foolish, asking you to risk your life when all I have to offer is a thank you. But you have to understand how much this means to us. And to Craglorn.\n\nI wish you luck. We'll remain here and wait for your return.
We are one and many, both. We share many things, but we cannot talk to each other except when in each other's presence.\n\nI know I have spoken to you, but I do not know the details of those conversations.
Oh, just a few days I reckon.
The first atronachs we summoned were ancient. They could communicate, to some extent. They didn't speak, but we heard them in our minds. \n\nThey commanded the others and we controlled them. With a gem we saw in a dream—the Gem of Celestial Command.
For the moment, but I have no doubt the Serpent will continue to try to gain control of the Mage's magicka—just as he continues to try to gain control of her aspects.
They've been making a nuisance of themselves in Belkarth for the last few days. Claim they need to speak to Hara of the Star-Gazers immediately.\n\nOf course, Hara hasn't been available, so they came here to wait.
Take this relic, the Seeker's Sight. It is a compass of sorts, one that is connected to all aspects of the Mage.\n\nBut like the Mage, the relic is broken. When you repair it, it will recognize our other aspects and lead you to them.
Heh, if only I could. I thought I'd gone mad. I did go mad. \n\nHara tells me that it was the Celestial Warrior who pulled me through time. I believe it, even if I don't understand how it's so.
Well, out of all of us, Kasimir was the prodigy. He was only nineteen years old, if you can believe it!\n\nBut summoning the atronachs was Dorian's idea. Or rather, his dream.
I don't know. It doesn't seem possible, does it? All I know is, she found me and brought me here.\n\nSo, you see, I owe Hara everything. I'll do anything for her. The Star-Gazers are my family now.
Haven't you guessed? The Court uses the most deadly predators to create the mantikoras. And there are few predators more dangerous than Men and Mer.\n\nNow, let's rescue the prisoners and remove this corrupt creation from the face of Nirn.
Hmph. Mind your tongue, outsider. Slander isn't tolerated in Dragonstar. Besides, filthy miners and old dust-wives can't help but lie. It's a known fact.\n\nWe only hire the most honorable warriors and caravaneers. Our clients deserve nothing less.
Indeed! Why just protect when you can control the entire supply line from start to finish?\n\nUnfortunately, the trouble with the Iron Orcs and the Scaled Court strains our resources and costs us gold. But make no mistake—we honor our commitments.
The catacombs extend beneath the once-grand Nedic city and into the Dragontail Mountains beyond.\n\nBesides containing the city's dead, ancient documents suggest the High King also used the catacombs to hold clandestine meetings and travel in secret.
Former member. \n\nI won't deny my involvement. Their beliefs and mine were once aligned. This era we live in, it's diseased. Contemptuous. A change would be welcome. Still, what the Court is doing … this is not the way.
I don't understand all the intricacies of magic, but she seemed genuinely concerned. It had something to do with Aetherial energy. I remember her mentioning that quite often.\n\nBut other than that, I just know that the disturbance is bad.
No? You don't think they're merry? I admit it might be a stretch, but you can't fault a writer for taking artistic liberties, can you?
Of course. It's good to have another woman in my life. She's as cold as a frost troll's arse, but she's starting to warm to my charms.\n\nI have a certain way with people. It's a gift.
Exactly. Don't give me that look. There's a market for the items we sell. Supply and demand. \n\nIf we weren't selling them, someone else would be. That's commerce.
Well, let's be honest—those savages aren't guild scholars. The second we catch wind of an attack, I send these brick-skulled mutts into the bushes. We hit them with a hail of arrows and finish off the stragglers with axes and flails. Simple.
Oh, you can, can you? Then let's see how you handle this.
Oh, not too much, really. I need you to find a set of slaver clothes so you don't look like one of the prisoners. Plus, we need the gate key or we'll never make it to the docks.\n\nHere. Take my spare lockpick in case you need it.
Oh? Let me see that. Submit to council … Argonian slave freed … services to House Telvanni ….\n\nWell, well. I've always known Sun-in-Shadow to be ambitious, but this is quite the master stroke. I shall take this to the council and send for her.
Difficult to say. Slaves are a valuable commodity. I suspect they would either kill us outright or sell us back to our previous masters.\n\nThe sum we paid to Khartag was meager—too meager for the Camonna Tong anyway. They will not take us home.
Oh, can you now? Well, that's a whole different discussion. If you've got the coin, I don't see any harm in letting you pop in for a look around.\n\nSo, what do you say? Willing to make a donation to the city's constabulary?
The Order of the Eye works within the Mages Guild to research unexpected effects of the Planemeld. The borders of Tamriel and Oblivion continue to blur.\n\nFor example, relics appear where they should not. Especially those of the Mad God.
Bandits. I commend you for springing to this mer's defense, but you should be cautious. \n\nI'm investigating some … irregularities in Suran's justice system. I fear the town's lead constable, Marshal Hlaren, may be arresting people without cause.
When I accepted your offer of assistance, I didn't expect you to be this thorough. \n\nYour bravery in descending into that dreugh infested mine alone and slaying … whatever it was that was killing the pilgrims is commendable.
If you're offering? I suspect Ashlanders are behind the disappearances, but I don't have the numbers to chase them off. \n\nIf you can sneak into their camp near Molag Mar and find me proof of their involvement, I could finally get some reinforcements.
Are you questioning my expertise? Ancient Elven is like a second language to me and scholars across Tamriel revere my ability to make sense of historic gibberish!\n\nStill, I could check my notes again, just to be sure ….
Of course! His Black Snail mercenaries have been resupplying there. That must be where he's headed.
You haven't staked a claim on today's dungeon. Return when you're committed to exploring new ground and I'll offer you the pledge.
In a clearing to the southeast, but that can wait.\n\nI trust you've seen what Halinjirr and I were growing in there. Moon-sugar. In its raw form, it's a crude narcotic. But if you refine it, it becomes something truly odious. Skooma.
Oh, a hundred blessings on you, walker! It is good to see that not every Dark Elf in Vvardenfell is an uptight prude.
Of course it did. Probably had his preserved toe for good measure. I'm not interested in bones. I'm looking for blessed relics sent as gifts to his beloved family. Heirlooms they buried with them in this tomb. Can we get to the exploring now, please?
Relics of Oblivion. To say more than that would take many hours. Time I do not wish to devote to conversation. I'm sure we both have work to do.
Oh, I have, but Benar tells me nothing. It's just "secure more buyers" and "hire more workers." He gets dreadfully annoyed when I press him about my concerns. Like, why do we need so many miners? Even the townsfolk are starting to talk about that.
I was his apprentice, but that was years ago. Spent time working in the Clockwork City. That's where I learned about energy transference, Dwemer engineering, mechanical symmetry—made me the Dark Elf I am today.\n\nBut I have a question. Who sent you?
I will not invade an ancestor tomb. No Ashlander would be welcome in such a place. They are as unclean and treacherous as the Three.\n\nYou may test if the trespass of outlander feet is of less offense, but I will remain here.
Not a pleasing thought, but it's an explanation I can accept. We can only hope the world never sees the like of the true Ruddy Man again.\n\nIt's gone for now, and we've avoided a feud with the Ashlanders, so let's try to look on the bright side.
Reachmen and minotaurs! Like none I've ever seen. They cut out their hearts and put the blood red rock we mine in their place. It turns their skin to stone and their blood to fire.\n\nAnd that's not even to speak of their infernal Forge.
Your instincts serve you well. Chodala's path took a dark turn. However, my sight clouds when I look too closely. Sotha Sil built Sunna'rah, but he did not create it with this vile purpose in mind.\n\nYou must act on my behalf—and Vivec's.
Incarnate Aduri was a champion of my people. She defended us against great threats. But when she grew to love war for war's sake, she proved she wasn't the Nerevarine.\n\nWhen Chodala proclaims that war is the answer, hand me this scroll.
We did, thanks to your efforts.\n\nGot to admit, I'm shocked we all made it out of there alive. Daren probably earned himself a limp, but on the whole I'd call this a measured success.
You sniveling little s'wit. Do you know how valuable—? Never mind. What's done is done. But don't expect any extra coin from me now. You'll have what was promised for killing Malur and not a drake more.\n\nThis had better buy your silence as well.
Where to?
Well?
It will allow us to stop Chodala? Then of course I'll help you.\n\nSince the Tribunal's dogs took my weapons, I'll need to replace them. Meet me at the ruins when you're ready.
My brother … travels. We have not heard from him for quite some time, but I sense that he remains safe and in possession of his full power.\n\nFunny. He always wanted to discover the limits of our divinity. Perhaps I will solve that mystery for him.
It's a wonder and a miracle, all brass tunnels, glass domes, and giant gears. He was inspired by the work of the Dwemer, but the Clockwork City is pure Sotha Sil. He made it to forge the future and reshape the world. I learned a lot there.
Attracted the attentions …? Never mind, I don't want to know.\n\nI'll miss this place, but Vehk knows I'm not much of a farmer. I'm just glad I got to thank you in person. Your partner, Mertis, already paid me for the deed to the property.
Veya fled after a family … disagreement. She's run away before, but I'm concerned that she might have something more permanent in mind this time. And more dangerous.\n\nVeya knows how to evade the House Guard. But, as you said, she doesn't know you.
So you're a scholar as well? I certainly wouldn't have predicted that.\n\nBefore the Tribunal showed up, we Dunmer worshiped the Daedra. They raised no small amount of havoc, but they also left us valuable gifts. Gifts like the stones.
The savages barged into the deep chambers. Seemed to know about the hidden passage and everything. Stole the relic the cultists were praying over and ran for the hills.\n\nAs a matter of fact, that's where I'm going—as soon as it's safe to leave!
I couldn't make them out, just saw them from afar before I spotted Nevena. Seemed to be searching for something. That statue maybe?
I don't know, but it doesn't matter. He's developed a method to grow vast quantities of moon-sugar in Vvardenfell. That's a dangerous skill. Too dangerous. Can you imagine what would happen if the Camonna Tong crime family got a hold of his notes?
Halinjirr's no Daedric Prince, but his work could be just as destructive. Please, just do the right thing.
So you retrieved my … stolen energy. You … stopped Barbas ….\n\nNow … return what is rightfully mine ….
This is the port town of Seyda Neen, on the island of Vvardenfell. We fished you out of the burning wreckage of a slaver ship near Firemoth.\n\nIf you're not a slaver, why were you dressed as one?
Oh, that sounds just like my Narsis! Sometimes he has so many thoughts going through his head, he can get distracted.\n\nHis work in the Dreloth tomb is very important. So if you can make sure he's all right, I would really appreciate it.
Sure is. You looking for work? Nah, you're the adventurous type. Only time you'll lift a pick is to bash in some beastie's skull, am I right? Of course I am.\n\nWhat brings you out here to the arse end of nowhere?
That was poetry in motion! Not only is my organization getting choice assignments again, but we're starting to recover some of our prestige.\n\nSpecifically, these Malacath cultists interfered with House Telvanni, so they had to be dealt with.
My brother, Chodala, is the Ashkhan of our tribe and I am his ambassador. I act as a go-between among the tribes. Chodala wants to unite the Dunmer and calmly end the era of the bickering Houses. He hopes to convince the tribes to follow his lead.
By answering a few simple questions, such as this one.\n\nHouse Indoril holds what cherished institution to be most precious?
No! There's no need to involve the governor's deputy. Or the house guard. When they start breathing down my neck, my scales shrivel right up!\n\nI did notice someone near the lighthouse that night.
Part of the fun is the suspense.  \n\nMenaldinion was ingratiating when he first came here. I realize now he was getting a lot of information out of me. Suffice it to say he also revealed some interesting facts about himself too.
Goodness, I thought everyone knew that. They are the ones that grow the widest tops, and tend to have a smoother skin. They are all over Vvardenfell and Deshaan. The moss I need is not common. Look for wide topped parasols. The moss likes the shade.
Try not to mention that when the guards haul you away.\n\nI'm sorry, but you'll be better off in a cell until all this is over.
Oh, you do, do you? And why in Oblivion would I tell you anything about that?
The captain serves House Redoran with honor and dedication. He's out doing his job. \n\nIf Brivan had anything to do with my son's death, he would have reported it to me. He'd have no reason to keep such news from me and the other councilors.
Two. Kanzin and Muz-Shah. Both powerful soothsayers in their own right.\n\nKanzin vanished a week ago, pruning his sugar canes. His fellow votaries told me that he showed no signs of distress. He simply walked out into the field and never came back.
Veya's young, bored, and stubborn. That makes for a volatile combination. She wants fresh air and freedom. I can't blame her for that.\n\nI can blame her for assuming I'm not aware of her little excursions. I thought I trained her better than that.
Danger's a relative term. Especially when you're dealing with relatives.\n\nVeya can make her own decisions. If she wants to risk getting caught by House Redoran, that's on her head. Especially since she knows they've been searching that area.
Ha! That's a good one! That Tribunal nonsense is almost as funny as some of the things I heard in Wrothgar.\n\nSay, if you want to get together later, I know a couple of bawdy stories that I'd love to share.
The tribes rejected him. Azura set her face against him. Now Chodala's seeking aid wherever he can find it. That makes him more desperate than I imagined—and more dangerous.\n\nWhy he decided to solicit Malacath, the God of Curses, I have no idea.
Perhaps, but I don't think so. The Oathbreaker prefers a more direct approach. He isn't one to hide behind convoluted schemes and plots.\n\nStill, if Malacath agrees to support my brother, we'll have one more problem to deal with.
Councilor Eris Releth oversees Redoran operations in Balmora and the surrounding countryside. He's very influential, very powerful. \n\nUsually the councilor doesn't allow his passions to get the better of him, but Veya is his daughter, after all.
My silt strider can take you to Balmora or Vivec City. She's fast, friendly, and almost never snacks on our customers.\n\nAlmost never.
If the place has a port and a dock, I can take you there. Where do you want to go?
Wonderful! I'll decipher its portion of the clues and finalize the associated section of the diorama at once!
That's a bit out of the blue! But it just so happens that my wife and I have been discussing a move back to Balmora.
I'd consider it, but my wife would never forgive me if we left without knowing what has happened to our son Seythen.\n\nHe went off adventuring. We've had no word in days now and Ninave is worried sick.
And I'll figure out how to get this door open. Just in case. \n\nYou know, attending a House Redoran council meeting was always a secret goal of mine. Right after getting a lusty Argonian maiden to scrape my flesh raw with her abrasive tongue.
No one just wanders into a Council Mouth's office looking around. I should report you. \n\nWhat are you really after? And do be honest. We've already wasted enough time here.
I only need him to survive long enough to sponsor me. He won't break ground on his tower anytime soon. Plus, there's a rumor that Dratha suffers from some mysterious illness. It could be Firuth's doing. You never can tell with the Telvanni.
The situation is wound dangerously tight, but I believe the gears revolve around you. Once you leave, I should be perfectly safe. Or, at least as safe as I ever am in the midst of all these experiments. \n\nYou however …. Stay vigilant, my friend.
My man-servant Stibbons? He's lazy, drinks too much, and requires detailed instructions to accomplish the simplest of tasks. But his fish stew is delicious, I'll grant him that.\n\nI regret letting him read my collection of Investigator Vale mysteries.
Of course we do! I specifically waited for you to arrive because I figured that would be the case.\n\nStill doesn't mean I'm happy about blurring the line between helping Veya and performing my duty as a Morag Tong.
As I said, the atelier's the workshop where Sotha Sil used Sunna'rah to experiment with his own divine energy. The reservoir located inside was specifically designed to contain such massive power.\n\nAs far as workshops go, it's a masterpiece!
My dear Maraya clings terribly to her people's mistrust of magic almost as much as her natural severity … and sword. She seems to think that setting off hundreds of flashy magical projections in the city would be a public menace.\n\nSilly, isn't it?
Sure. I've got a few minutes.\n\nAh, who am I kidding? I've got plenty of time. What do you want to know?
By breaking it down to its very essence and then rebuilding it again.\n\nI need you to destroy these spirits until you find one powerful enough that its essence remains. Bring that essence back to us and we'll do the rest.
Sharz is getting some rest and Lord Thanlen is trying to figure out how to weasel out of paying us, but if Galgalah is banished, and he was the controlling force behind the haunting, it'll clear soon. We were successful.\n\nStill, it wasn't worth it.
I don't have much in the way of specifics, but the fact that the tax offices were raided in several regions in a relatively short period of time, I'd say they have numbers.
Surely an adventurer of your stature isn't frightened of a single Dremora? Summoning Daedra is no more dangerous than taming bears—and even you dull-witted Orcs can do that.\n\nBelieve me, it's quite safe. I'll send it away as soon as I'm finished.
A bribe? Vehk's head, you really want to see him don't you?\n\nAll right, fine. Fork it over, flat-head. And keep this quiet, all right?
The moons are kind. I knew you would not betray a fellow child of Jone and Jode.\n\nWe stored Gothren's trinkets in crates nearby. The smugglers will groan at their absence, but we would rather face the wilds alone than go back to Tel Aruhn.
Wait, are you saying you don't know who Divayth Fyr is?
The Telvanni were expanding the workshop into the caverns beyond this chamber, where the rift came into being. \n\nIt seemed a trick of the light at first, like a carnival mirror, then it began to tear. Wider and wider, until … things spilled out.
Apparently it sang a little song and all of my "well-respected" sailors just went belly up and ran the ship ashore. From what I can gather this isn't the first time it's happened either.\n\nReally, I've never heard of something so outlandish!
It didn't seem like a bad idea at the time. What good is a queen without a colony? We sprayed just a smidge of pheromones here and there, and kwama started rushing in!\n\nThe issue was getting them to stop. We're still working through that one.
Finding useless ruins is the family business. My own mother currently heads our research team. She insisted I put the notice up, if you must know.\n\nHonestly, if it was up to me I'd be a fat, happy baker right now. Instead I'm just a scrawny coward.
Sotha Sil's private domain? It's said that the place holds the secret to re-making Nirn … I suppose that would interest Barbas and his master, Clavicus Vile.\n\nBut Clockwork City can wait. The moonlet hanging above us? Not so much.
Blessings of the Three upon you.
That's one I won't soon forget. Poor Veya. I was her mentor. I should have seen what was happening to her early enough to help.\n\nBut I wanted to ask you something. Why do you keep showing up and sticking your beautiful nose in my business?
It certainly sounded that way. The Hound said something about using Vivec's energy to open a portal. Why would he—oh no!\n\nThat much power could punch a hole through all of Sotha Sil's defenses, allowing Clavicus Vile to enter the city!
I'll be celebrating the mine's return to glory once our Queen grows up and our miners aren't fighting off the effects of crazy songs.\n\nFor now, I'm celebrating the fact I don't have a Dunmer thorn in my arse anymore.
Sadrith Mora is up on the eastern coast, so you could walk, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nTalk to Synda, our local navigator. She can sail you up there on her next trip. That's how I was going to get up there, until I missed my delivery time.
After I added together the variables, the only logical response was to do as Azura asked. Sotha Sil's safeguards mean nothing if we allow Vivec to die and Vvardenfell to be destroyed.
My thoughts have not yet settled on a definitive answer. Some other Daedric Princes, perhaps? But that's a problem for another day.\n\nGo forth, my friend, and get the signet. We have a ceremony to perform!
I sure did! I had my doubts, but after my fourth kill I felt like Pelinal himself! Exalted, you know? Plus, my superiors noticed, and I'm getting extra rewards!\n\nToo bad they wouldn't let me drain the whole bowl. I could take on an entire legion!
Only during the period of our celebration! Then it seems to imbue warriors with a holy fervor for righteous carnage.\n\nIn fact, I overheard some soldiers say it doubled their normal contributions to the war. Doubled! Praise Pelinal!
Usually the Reachmen come to pillage what they can before they're chased off, but this clan is leaving nothing behind in their wake. They're here to hunt us. To conquer us. I think they're raising an army.
Reachmen are barbarians. Raiders and scavengers. They don't build. That Forge is something from ancient times, maybe not even built by mortal hands, but they're working it all the same with their foul Reach magic.
Not just the Reachmen! Take a look at my kin. Honest, hard working Nords, never held an ax for more than splitting wood, now they're clamoring for blood! Crazed and feral.\n\nNot me! I'm not going to let it happen to me.
I know a great many mages. The person I don't know, of course, is you. Why are you asking about Adeber?
Not really. I think my shadow may have peeled off some of my animus. My soul, I mean. Or maybe just some of my magical aptitude. Either way, it's something I'll miss.\n\nDon't blame yourself. You did keep it from killing me, after all.
Yes. I take it that you're unfamiliar with our order? That's hardly a surprise. We once served as advisors and teachers to the greatest kings and emperors, but no longer.\n\nWe retreated to our hidden isle of Artaeum, content to study in seclusion.
It was until the Reachmen corrupted it with their vile rituals. Our wards still glow with the power the Divines, so this place might yet be cleansed.
Oh, yes.\n\nItems of power always introduce some measure of peril to the world. This is doubly true with Daedric artifacts. They exist to carry out the dark intentions of their creators, you see? They turn even the best intentions to malice eventually.
If we knew for certain, we wouldn't be sending you to make a deal with a heretical Ashlander, now would we?\n\nChodala must have something to do with Vivec's energy loss, but the how and why remains a mystery. That's why I must examine that staff.
The truth is, I need Sovor as much as he needs me. I think the only way I can safely extract Bolin's soul from the gem is to offer it something in exchange. Who knows if I'll ever have another willing subject.\n\nCan I count on your assistance?
Of course.\n\nWe use scavenged alchemical tools to filter out clumps and impurities. Once we distill the remaining fluid, we add it to other substances to make many important things—fuels, lubricants, even cooking oil.
You dare question the sacred duty that has been placed before me? I'll have you know I'm … I'm ….\n\nWhat am I doing here? What is this place?
A new apprentice? Really? But what does Chirrhari know of such things? This one works in the dark and grows fungi, molds, and mosses. The lector keeps me too busy for other concerns.
A voyage that only a few have ever undertaken. We will travel to Sotha Sil's peculiar experiment—the Clockwork City.\n\nI have inquiries to make. You will assist me.
Of course. Lector Naril tasked each of us with a different experiment. I'm attempting to grow plants without the benefit of the simulated sunlight. I haven't had any success so far, but someone has to tackle the difficult experiments, I suppose.
Some daft talking crows!\n\nAfter that terrible business with the Shadow, I returned to my office to think. I arrived just in time to see one of those disgusting birds make off with the artifact! I panicked and ran here to hide.
It's not my place to question his decisions. He ordered me to find you, and I obeyed.\n\nLord Fyr values diverse perspectives, but he has few mortal peers. So he often breaks bread with … unusual people. Perhaps you strike him as unusual.
They proved useful. Raynor's theories need some work, and Kireth's refusal to listen to reason caused me no small measure of anxiety. But on the whole? Satisfactory.\n\nProvided that they follow my lead, I might call on them again in the future.
Not anymore. In the old days, sure. He was easy to please because he was never around.\n\nThese days? He changes his mind about something every night. Constant meetings, new dictums daily, adjustments to factotum patrols. It's a nightmare!
The Clockwork Apostles are a group of scholars dedicated to Sotha Sil. They're the defacto rulers of Clockwork, given that their God of Mysteries doesn't get out much.\n\nNaturally they would be concerned that their drinking water is in danger.
Well, I suppose … that I had a connection at all?\n\nWhen I arrived in Clockwork, I was immediately drawn to the Apostles. I knew they could help me strengthen not only my magic, but also my technical skills, which are already quite impressive.
Right, right—don't let me keep you. I can't imagine how demanding Divayth Fyr must be. Better you than me, that's for sure. Keep your nose to the cogs and you'll be fine.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm off to flip two dozen switches. Again.
Hmm. Normally, I'd say we should simply kill them all and take the key by force. But it seems these birds have a real talent for hiding things.\n\nDaedra and cultists tossed the district for hours, and from what we can tell, they didn't find anything.
Well? Which one should I use to woo my sharp-eyed love?
Reflecting. Permissions registered.\n\nI completed the cognitive archival process and data retention is within acceptable parameters. Unfortunately, my current tok-plug storage quantity equals zero. It must equal one for vocal emulation to proceed.
False assertion. This is not a tok-plug. \n\nFortunately, I located a tok-plug in a mnemo-crate outside my immediate visual range. Your assistance, while appreciated, is no longer required. Please ask the deceased resident your questions.
The Halls of Regulation is filled to the brim with steam, and ventilation fans are used throughout the building to help keep the air clear. Unfortunately, one of these fans is rapidly slowing down.
Secondly, unlike other factotums, it openly speaks of its components. Trust me, I've interrogated many of these machines in the name of my research. Perhaps as we reconstruct its mind, it will tell us details about its creation.\n\nAnd thirdly ….
Our time together really opened my eyes. I realized how integral you were to my initial success. Not every task can be accomplished alone, after all!\n\nSo when I began having trouble maintaining the Halls, I sought the guidance of the Apostles.
I have to. For their sake, and for the memory of my mother.\n\nI need to show them that their fate is in their own hands. I received the same dire prophecy, but I found the treasure and changed my destiny. So can they, if they're willing to listen.
I am whatever the people need me to be. A guardian. An oppressor. For some, too distant. For others, too meddlesome. I am the canvas upon which they paint their dreams and resentments. A vessel for their hopes and doubts.\n\nA mirror. Nothing more.
Zero.\n\nFarewell, and good luck.
A home-cooked meal, Argonian pottery, or information. Since I'm a terrible cook, and we're worlds away from Black Marsh, I think I'll go with the third thing.\n\nThis Brass Fortress is brimming with gossip—I just need to listen for it. Wish me luck!
Evaluating query. Query assessment complete.\n\nI'm sorry, but I am unable to comment on statements categorized as theoretical. A wealth of information pertaining to matters theoretical can be found in the city archivox.
Mephala believes … she can reach Artaeum … through me ….\n\nThese bindings … you must find a way … to break them ….
Lector Naril developed it using techniques he still refuses to share. The simulated sunlight provides nourishing energy that makes most of the plants we grow thrive.\n\nNot my plants, mind you. Oh no. That would ruin the experiment!
The Everwound Wellspring. The only place in all of Clockwork City where actual plants grow and blossom. It's a miracle, thank Sotha Sil! Or Lord Seht. Or whatever the crazy Dark Elf calls himself these days.\n\nI hear the carrots are as tall as trees!
Underwhelmed? By me? Count your blessings that I have other matters to attend to, mortal. I have half a mind to show you just how powerful I am.\n\nThis city is mine! If you wish to dwell in it, I suggest you learn respect!
Have you forgotten so soon?\n\nI came to the Clockwork City in search of a Daedric artifact. Our misadventures in the Pneumatis and this mysterious relic share a common point of origin, I'm certain. Now it's just a matter of rooting it out.
I met him at Kinlord Milunthel's party in Alinor. We had similar ideas about the Queen's decree and I recommended that he lead the monastery.\n\nSummerset isn't a stew pot, and the various races aren't ingredients to be sprinkled in like so much spice.
Mara bless you! Losing Haladan was awful. I still see his bloody face with my waking eyes. The only thing keeping me sane is the knowledge that I might spare his reputation and the friend he dearly loved.\n\nThank you for this kindness.
Had he only spoken to us …. Do you see now? The bitter fruits of heedless magic? This is what happens when you turn away from tradition!\n\nRegardless, it appears you were right. Emile did not kill Haladan. I will nullify his conviction.
<Nothing happens.>
<The ward dissipates and the book's contents materialize.>
This one only knows what Lector Naril told her. He said that Gathal injured himself while performing an experiment. He never recovered. It was a tragedy.\n\nIdrono pays much more attention to gossip, so perhaps he can tell you more.
Oh, it's quite simple, really. Toss one in the air and relax your mind. Your hands will do the rest. I've used them a number of times and never cut myself, and I'm about as coordinated as a drunken mudcrab.\n\nI'm certain you'll impress a sponsor.
Just stand at that podium like we're up on stage. Then use your best announcer voice and talk me up to the crowd! Tell them there's no one half so clever as Clever, and that they've never seen anyone like me!
I'm well aware of what she believes. I wonder, though, if either of you have ever considered what Larydel wants.\n\nDo you truly wish to force Larydel onto a path he does not wish to walk? Do you believe that best serves the Sapiarchs?
I suppose there's no denying that now, though I'd ask you, please, don't share it with the others. When I joined the House of Reveries over a year ago, I gave up being Larydel. I am Alchemy, but my sister … well, she had other plans for me.
Why now, after everything?\n\nFine. I'll listen, if only to give her a piece of my mind for keeping my brother from me. If Larydel is truly set upon joining the House of Reveries, he should have told me instead of running away. I deserve a goodbye.
Huh. So Talerion and his lackeys haven't found him either, eh? Color me surprised. I tried to help the kid, but if he didn't even find my note …. He's in worse trouble than I thought.\n\nYou carry yourself well. Maybe Mother can use you.
Yes, this one has been exploring the Daedric connection as well. But Raz hates Daedra. In Raz's experience, very little good comes from dealing with Daedra or their cultists.\n\nAnd this revelation brings you to Rellenthil, yes?
Oh, did you? Well, let me see it then.\n\nThe Insatiable, is it? Who writes this rubbish? Grisly rubbish at that. I'll admit the methods are similar to our case, but this still doesn't prove the presence of an actual Daedra. Where did you find this?
Yes, I imagine you do. You've earned that right. What in particular do you want to discuss?
Ah, sorry about that. Location magic isn't always what one would call precise. \n\nI can tell you that all these locations are somewhere within Summerset. That should hopefully narrow your search.
Nocturnal betrayed the other Princes? That's … actually, that's rather typical, from what I've read.\n\nWithout the Heart, without the Ritemaster, what are we supposed to do now?
Ogres may not be the friendliest of creatures, but I was never bothered on my first trip to this mountain. The disease must have enraged them, caused them to turn aggressive.\n\nWhat a senseless death.
Perhaps it was for the best. This illness looks absolutely gruesome. At least their suffering has been put to an end.\n\nWe can't allow this disease to spread to the rest of Tamriel. Come, let's keep going.
No idea. A cult of Meridia doesn't usually make a big splash, but here in Summerset? Well, they don't look kindly on Daedric cults. Even the nice ones. Not surprised someone wanted them gone.\n\nWell, no matter to me. Long as I get those tokens.
You're right. Even without the Ritemaster, we can still do this. I can take the Resolute Diamonds and return to Artaeum immediately.\n\nBut … but … well, I'm kind of at a loss as to what we should do next.
I am afraid I cannot speak with an apraxic exile. It is forbidden. You, however …. She wouldn't know you from any other lice-ridden refugee. No offense.\n\nGo ahead and use this passage to the underground. Seek her out and find out what she's hiding.
Interesting. The Stuffed Goat represents stoic bravery and she never breaks any rules. How could she? She's dead! Anyway, she stands for all the same things as the Divine Prosecution.\n\nYes, I think that's the perfect gift to give to the Justiciar!
Well, there's a story there. You see in light of the Queen's decree the Illumination Academy has been inviting guest performers from all across Tamriel for their latest conclave, and of course I received an invitation, so I hopped on the first boat.
She'll be secured in the inner paddocks until order is restored. This act of sabotage will not be easy to recover from.\n\nYou claim you arrived after the incident?
Not exactly, but it's obvious to me that you believe that's what happened. I need to see for myself. In any event, there's no harm in approaching Mephala's shrine.\n\nI'm just a little concerned that it took me so long to open this door.
Every eleven years, two Sapiarchs are selected to undergo a long and extensive ritual to attune them to the Resolute Diamonds—the keys that open the Crystal Tower.\n\nThese sentinels guard the diamonds and utilize them to grant access to the tower.
Using the Crystal Tower and Sotha Sil's technique for utilizing life energy? Then we really are doomed. Without a way into the Crystal Tower, we can't even attempt to challenge Nocturnal, let alone try to stop her.
Mephala … Prince of the Secret Arts …. She sought my diamond … but also seemed very interested in … the Golden Knight.\n\nI fear … she's taken him … to the Spiral Skein ….
Unfortunately, I'm just not sure.\n\nNormally I'd blame the cultists, but I doubt they'd have this kind of power. These statues are ancient, imbued with old magic. I don't know what matter of mage could awaken them.
Unless he can conjure up a stone club the size of an ox yoke, I just can't imagine it. I'd tell you to examine the body yourself, but the Sapiarchs already burned it. Convenient.
Name's Lodiss the Rock.
Two trivial concessions, nothing more. First, just as Vile sends his Hound, I want you to take my earl, Leythen, into the Crystal Tower. And second, I wish a private meeting with Sotha Sil after reality has been saved.\n\nDo we have a deal?
Bloodletting, I think. These cave vermin poke and prod us whenever Arillas needs something to offer his Saviors. To what end, I don't know. Maybe they're vampires … or Wood Elves.
I spoke to Sapiarch Soraturil. If Emile makes a full confession, the Sapiarchs will let us handle the details of his imprisonment.\n\nI've arranged for Emile to return to Stormhaven. A familiar setting, sympathetic guards … it's the best I can do.
The Keepers marked my body with runes of restraint before they locked me in the tomb. After I … expired, my soul tried to escape. But even now, centuries later, I am tethered to that husk.\n\nIf you burn away my body, you also burn these runes.
Oh, my family has been here for generations and generations. Before the Queen's decree, outsiders might have been rare, but we were not unheard of.\n\nOur business has grown and gets better every day. That's why I sent for my cousin. We need the help.
Oh, just that the honor of lady-in-waiting is usually reserved for other High Elves.\n\nMistress Felanwe doesn't seem to mind though. She likes to keep me motivated by reminding me how insignificant I am and how unsuited to this role my people are.
Naliara … quit? I suppose I cannot fault her. Capture by vile Goblins was simply too much for her delicate spirit. \n\nBut without her records of my spontaneous, inspired verse my recital is doomed.
Favors are the currency of power here in Summerset. But don't concern yourself too much about it. Rolumdel will probably just want help with some minor legal matter or another. Nothing that you and the Nord won't be able to handle.
The Divine Prosecution enforces both secular and religious law. We're charged with maintaining the moral integrity of the entire island. As such, we conduct many different types of investigations, including those that deal with Daedra.
We never meant to take such a direct role in events. We're observers. Watchers. We lend a hand, guide fate, but never directly shape it.\n\nBesides, I need to return to Artaeum and take up the mantle of Ritemaster, at least for a little while.
On an interim basis, until we get beyond this crisis and can make a decision for the future.\n\nIn the meantime, I want to atone for what the Ritemaster and Leythen did. I owe Summerset that much, at least.
Justiciar is my rank within the Divine Prosecution. It means I have more authority and responsibility than a bailiff, but not as much as a chief justiciar or a magistrate.\n\nI tend to investigate criminal infractions and adjudicate legal disputes.
Newcomers often erroneously reach that conclusion. It defines an aspect of my role, but not the entirety.\n\nJusticiars not only render judgment, but also embody the righteousness of law. Pity I'm forced to work with newcomers, though.
I sense Darien in Summerset's northwest region, but Leythen's magic prevents me from identifying a more precise location.\n\nPlease. I need your help. The Resolute Diamonds are proving more difficult to unravel than I imagined and there's no one else.
You know, it may be silly, but I suppose I came here to step out of his shadow. If I could be the one to crack Ebon Stadmont, well, perhaps that would be enough.\n\nAnd then I was trapped in the past to serve a mysterious being. Or I would have been.
I suggest he read our Guide to Altmeri Culture. He can read, can't he? There's a copy just there on the table.\n\nIf he meets the preconditions and notifies my second, Fandilol, I promise to duel that filthy glan'nt at the determined place and time.
Do you know how long this marriage arrangement has been underway? Decades! Decades worth of work, all gone if Niralin smears her name through Wood Elf muck.\n\nWhy, I'd rather suffer a thousand cuts than such a wound to my reputation.
I should be thanking you. You had no reason to trust me, yet you did. And you gave me a chance to see my wife … to reconcile with her in a way.\n\nNow, go and beat Nocturnal. I have faith in you!
Tell her I'm going to go be with our daughter.\n\nTell Val … that we will … we will wait … for … her ….
From what I've been able to observe, the smugglers have entered into some kind of arrangement with the Sea Sload. They occasionally leave prisoners for the creature to toy with.\n\nUnfortunately, Grog is just the latest in a long line.
Time is of the essence. While you go south to aid Miriya, I'll return to Alinor and bring what we've learned so far to the Battlereeve. It splits our forces, but I don't see any other way.\n\nGood luck and may the stars light your path.
I certainly hope so. I might even send word to Oriandra. See if the Psijics are interested in helping.\n\nWe won't let Summerset sink, my friend. Not on our watch!
Yes. I was rejected when I was but a babe. One look upon my face should tell you why. \n\nI was raised by the priests of Stendarr. Stern mer who did not much care to cater towards the whims of a child. It was a cold upbringing.
No! It couldn't be. We care for these animals like they were our kin. No one I know would harm one of these poor creatures, let alone do something like this.
He did. Perhaps I deserved it. But all those people—an innocent girl, a naive young mer … a dear friend. They paid the price, while I still live. I don't know if I'll ever make peace with that.
Well, you're the right person for the job, right now. Time and circumstances, my friend. Time and circumstances. I know you won't let us down.
Yes! Investigator Vale, at your service.\n\nHave a puzzling crime to report? Well, I'll sort out your issue soon enough. First, I need to expose the sticky-fingered pie pilferer. It's clearly one of these two.
Yes, the Altmer have a few peculiar notions. But as luck would have it, I heard that Queen Ayrenn has just issued a decree to open Summerset to immigrants and visitors. That's the perfect excuse for you to investigate the island.
The map will show you the approximate location of each time breach. I apologize. Our visions, while powerful, are not always specific.\n\nMake your way to each X on the map, then use the Augur of the Obscure to discover the anomaly's exact location.
If you can believe it. I admired him as an opponent long before I fell in love with him. He was brave, tenacious, dare I say reckless. He had pride, but not the empty sort that puffs up most High Elves. He'd earned his command. I could tell.
What a hateful accusation! Tilcalar told me he was going to send them back where they came from. I had no idea he planned to kill them. I give you my word. I just wanted the newcomers to go away.\n\nAnd to find out he worshiped Daedra. How crude!
Clavicus Vile, Mephala, and Nocturnal joined forces to threaten Nirn. It appears their ultimate goal is to take control of the Crystal Tower for a reason we haven't yet determined. Leythen is part of the Court of Bedlam, their mortal servants.
Wild reef vipers are large, toothy ambush predators. Dangerous, but easily taken by a skilled hunter. It's the ones the Sea Elves train as pets that you'll need to worry about, but there's slim chance finding one of those.
Your friend's dead. If these Saviors really are vampires what chance do we have against them?
The Maestro's notes said the ancient words were etched into a massive stone. I expect you'll need to travel deeper into the forest to find the exact location.\n\nI can't translate the words the Ritemaster heard until you find that stone.
Our Princes plan to do away with the laws imposed by other powers. They want to remake Nirn, reshape it to better suit their every inclination.\n\nOf course to do this, all obstacles must be cast aside—including the other Daedric Princes.
As much as it pains me, I must concur. We'll just have to make sure that once we recover the Heart, it isn't allowed to fall into the hands of the Court of Bedlam or their Princes.\n\nDarien's outside. Talk to him, then meet me in the Dreaming Cave.
My kin feel I'm wasting my life on a footnote. My parents even threatened to disown me if I continued my search, but that only spurred me on. I want to know why this branch of the family was all but forgotten.
Many times. Loudly. Repeatedly.\n\nIf we trade our ship, there will be no choice but to settle down. An honorable life in the sun is all this one asks. It's what Renzir wants too. He just needs the right push.
She did? Why would she—you must understand! \n\nIn Summerset, there is no opportunity for a Khajiit. The High Elves only expect the worse from us, and yet, the only life we can make is one within the shadows.
They took her away! Said they had to scrutinize her qualifications, test her knowledge of culture and etiquette. But I haven't seen her since!\n\nMy work suffers, so of course I complained to the monks. Now I have to gather my own shells!
Don't bother asking me! Mostly, because I have no idea.\n\nI would have died, had the Spirit not saved me. And it wasn't too bad. A supporting role, at best. I'd make sure the loop continued, make sure Andewen kept researching. Again and again.
Very little. And that's by design.\n\nEven now, three-hundred years later, Mannimarco's influence lingers over that place. The air is thick with the smell of old books and rot. It is a place of evil. Pure and simple.
It means just that. We took our island of Artaeum and sent it someplace else to better promote meditative study and contemplation.\n\nWe maintain an interest in Tamriel, though, hence my appearance here during your time of need.
That rootarse best still be by the road. She owes me for this!
As I said earlier, changing the past has far-reaching consequences. For all I know, healing Fletch could have dire consequences to our present.\n\nI would have had to weigh his life against the potential impact of that change. Quite the somber thought.
A research exercise that needs to be concluded. As soon as possible, as well as possible, and with as few distractions as possible.\n\nGiven the assistants I must work with, my goal can only be attained with strict motivation.
The College is breathing down the Sapiarchs' neck, so he's taking it out on us. And as a lowly assistant, I have no room to complain.
Your flaws are showing, newcomer. Don't you know that the Altmer of Summerset each have a purpose and a function? I can no sooner ask a farmer to abandon his field as I can alter the course of a flowing river.\n\nIt simply isn't done.
To be frank, at this point I'll take what I can get.\n\nAs a justiciar of the Divine Prosecution, my orders are clear. Do whatever it takes to make sure these contracts get completed. I never shirk my duty, and neither should you.
If you ask my compatriots, they will claim we are after an indrik, but unless they're attracted to the stink of wine I doubt we'll be seeing one today.\n\nProbably for the best, such a majestic creature shouldn't be subjected to this.
I suggested it, but she just stands here, looking at me expectantly. So I apologize and she tells me I'm not doing it right, or something, like I've got to beg.\n\nI don't even see how I'm to blame and this Elf wants me to beg for forgiveness?
If Cloudrest is known for anything, it's the Welkynars. \n\nThe fact that they were able to capture something as dangerous as a Sea Sload tells you of their might in battle. Especially one as powerful as Z'Maja.
The fact that she's a Sload should tell you the most of what you need to know. She's cunning, powerful, and filled with hatred.\n\nI've never seen the likes of her shadow magic before, and I hope I never do again.
The smugglers have a shanty set up on the ridge overlooking the bay. I'm pretty sure the captain keeps her stuff in there.\n\nIf you're going after the journal, well, good luck with that. I'm getting out of here!
I will never tell you, you guileless, flop-heeled buffoon! You don't deserve it! None of you do!
It does stretch credible belief, and she's suspicious enough as it is. She can enjoy her next meal behind bars.
Yes, it hardly merits intervention at all. I'm declaring the birds abandoned property. The Argonian may go.
What a friend! You're the best. I love you, not that Elf. He won't even dance with me!\n\nTo you … person!
A Daedric Prince has part of the tower crystal? How? No, don't tell me. I'm going to have nightmares about this as it is.\n\nWe're in the midst of attempting a hastened attunement ritual to replace the tower sentinels. I should get back to it.
Probably wants to make some kind of a deal. That's his bread and butter, you know.\n\nYou can do what you want, but I figure you're even more angry with Nocturnal for the way she evaporated your friend and took the Heart of Transparent Law.
While we have never been formally introduced, the Proxy Queen is quite familiar with the reputation of the Psijic Order and its Ritemaster. She will adhere to the ancient dictates and provide the assistance we need in this matter.
I didn't feel comfortable with my past identity. Being a mage, being a man, it all felt wrong.\n\nBut everyone in the troupe understood that. They encouraged me to become who I truly wished to be. I'm not even the first member to change my gender.
Well, I don't think she's particularly pleased about the whole affair. She's always had a dream of us becoming great mages together.\n\nShe's promised to let me sort things out, though. To figure out my own path. That's all I can ask for.
There was another Storn in my village. Stone drunk at all hours of the day. He once fell in a mead tank and had to drink his way out. Practically a village hero after that.\n\nI was just Sober in comparison.
Not just here, but across all of Summerset.\n\nIt's a personal matter to some, and not everyone is comfortable talking about it or educating others. But I've met many wonderful souls who've transitioned, within and without the House of Reveries.
The darkness she's summoned here saps the life of all it touches.\n\nShe can also conjure shadow creatures which serve her. She used that magic to create … copies of my companions. Dark reflections.
Hannayel mentions something isn't right here. That she plans to hide in a quiet room. Very smart. It seems the Sapiarch knows that someone is hunting her.\n\nThe list of specific books in a specific order, though. That's the key, Raz thinks.
She was right. We are stubborn and stolid. If we continue to believe our way is the only way, we're going to unprepared for the changes ahead. The Queen's decree will bury us.\n\nConvincing the Divine Prosecution of that? It'll be a long, hard road.
<The book returns to your hand.>
<The book returns to your hand.>
I'm fine. I wish that he'd stop, I don't know … hovering.\n\nI won't lie to you. I'm disappointed that we won't have the opportunity to study the staff and its time-distorting properties, but that's ultimately his decision. I will abide by it.
Maybe. The leadership seems confident enough. As for me, I'm just happy to have the opportunity to see it!\n\nNow, you should probably check in with the Loremaster. With any luck, our scryers have found the remaining fragments already.
That was the plan, yes. But as he may have told you, separating the pieces has proven difficult—even for our most powerful monks.\n\nIt looks like we'll have to study the staff after all. I'm sure I don't need to tell you how exciting that is!
For the time being. Let's see what's through that opening.
Leythen's reports became less frequent. Then he stopped sending them altogether. I'd know if he was dead, but he could be a prisoner. Or hurt ….\n\nMy main concern right now is the threat posed by the Daedric Princes. Leythen … will have to wait.
It's hard to say.\n\nOnce you have a few conversations with it, you'll see what I mean.
In accordance with our current regulations, each deputized citizen may accept a single contract from each justiciar every day. You are encouraged, of course, to check back regularly for new assignments.\n\nDoes this kind of work appeal to you?
I know. If it hadn't been for you and Talomar, I'd probably be dead, Lotus would be a monster, and nobody would be the wiser.\n\nIt was nice feeling important for awhile, but wow it's stressful.
Yes. A disastrous deal.\n\nShortly after I left, the Longhouse Emperor, Leovic, put out a call for an Alik'ri trader to transport a shipment of arms across the desert. Afarh leapt at the opportunity. He used our entire estate as collateral.
Why, everyone.\n\nThere are many voices within my troupe, all passionate, but not always cohesive. I simply lend my ear and give wisdom when needed. A voice of logic when many are led by their hearts. That is all.
I am truly sorry, initiate. It pains me to send you into such peril alone.\n\nRest assured, we will keep a close eye on your progress. Once you have rendered the staff inert, we will come to assist you immediately.
Do not mourn its passing, my friend.\n\nIn truth, arcane power is the least of the Psijics' gifts. The true might of the order is found in wisdom, prudence, and right action. I can pass that on to the next generation of mages no matter what.
Our deal! What else?\n\nWhen we set out, I held you to a promise. You said if I helped you, you'd try to keep me out of the Psijic vault. Well, I helped. So …?
Ah, the hero demurs. Well, I suppose we'll find out soon enough.\n\nBut enough of that. This might be our last farewell, mate! What's the custom? Lifting a vessel full of that swill you pour down your face-hole and saying something saccharine?
Ha! I knew you were clever.\n\nIn answer to your direct question, yes, I know what you'll do. But I want you to look at me when you say it. So you're also saying it to yourself, see? A moment of truth and self-reflection! How exciting!
Oh. Well that's great! I nearly have everything I need to complete my epic of the war fought between the Goblins and High Elves here. All that's left is for me to uncover the site of their most pivotal battle.\n\nCome! Let's make history!
Swimmingly, though I think Silurie's brashness is rubbing off on us. We never got as close as you did to the organization's leadership, but while you were lopping off the heads of the hydra, we were sweeping its legs out from under it.
I don't, for the most part, but I'm trying to be more open minded. There is some merit to it, if you look deeply enough, and a good investigator should leave no stone unturned.
The Sapiarchs are the sages of Summerset. A college comprised of the finest minds in Altmer society. Each Sapiarch is devoted to a single area of expertise. Together, they maintain the greatest collection of knowledge in the world.
Doesn't matter what I believe. What I know is that she's incredibly dangerous.\n\nOur reports indicate that she has the ability to compel other werewolves to do her bidding. Even somehow attract them to her. That's why the Moon Hunter Pack is so large.
Sometimes, the Archivist's experiments would have … unintentional effects. Often, werewolves would break under the agony. In their rage, they became nearly unstoppable.\n\nSo a poison was made to quickly end their lives.
The Hunting Grounds may be full of danger, but my tribe hails from Valenwood. Dangerous forests and elusive quarry are part of our everyday life.\n\nI just hope you aren't foolish enough to underestimate us.
That makes the area you need to search considerably smaller!\n\nFind that ship and stop Margus before he completes the ritual that unleashes the curse. I'd really rather not see Murkmire destroyed, thank you very much!
A little …? Oh! Har! That's a good one!\n\nWell, looks like we've reached the dregs, so a deal's a deal. Here's your salt. Don't be a stranger, eh?
Oof. I think that one could use some work, friend! Har! I'd help, but we've run dry.\n\nBest take your salt. Do yourself a favor and stick to the adventuring, eh?
I think our Goblin squatters helped themselves to some of the construct's parts. We'll either need to get them back, or find suitable substitutes.\n\nFollow my skeevaton through the door Ranja's unlocked. If we're lucky it'll sniff out what we need.
The Khajiiti sea captain, eh? Ha! Everyone wants to work with Jimila! \n\nI met her a few months ago. I needed a reliable ship to carry Alik'ri trade goods. No small thing, what with the war and all. Jimila made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
So they are! How good of you to join us, little croakers!\n\nLet's go inside, beeko. Our happy chorus must be fitted into the vossa-satl. I envy them their new lives of pampered luxury. We should all be so lucky!
So the Dead-Water tribe helped you after all? What a fascinating development. Between your heroism and Jaxsik-Orrn's raw strength, I'm sure you showed those brutes what for!\n\nI hesitate to ask, but what did the Blackguards learn about the Remnant?
All part of the process. Adding your juices to the mix helps the reagents dissolve into a solution. Been trying to recreate the effect in a flask, but it just curdles and ruins the whole batch.\n\nSometimes traditional methods are best.
The makings of a grisly display. Do not trouble yourself with concerns of desecration. When we return to the Hist, the flesh remains as a gift to Sithis. Its purpose fulfilled, it returns to the swamp to form something new.
Not as many as you would expect. Most Argonians from Murkmire are more interested in the here and now. They believe that the past is dead and gone and best forgotten.\n\nMe? Oh, the past has always fascinated me. That's why I joined up with Concordia!
Xukas will try to take this burden on himself. But his tribe—all of Murkmire would mourn him, and many long years may pass before he returns. The marsh would grow darker without him.\n\nIf I pass, my people will not mourn. And neither should you.
I have heard many claims regarding the accuracy of her predictions. She is frequently sought out by farmers, sailors, and the like … perhaps a little too sought out.
The ceremony bonds those who have chosen to lay an egg together.\n\nMany dryskins compare it to a wedding. This is not entirely accurate, of course. While there is always respect between the bonded pair, romantic feelings are not strictly necessary.
Who would want to kill Haxara? That makes no sense … and who killed the Veeskhleel?\n\nDon't tell me you think Haxara killed this ojel. She averts her gaze from our cookfires for pity of the creatures on the spits. She could never have done this.
Why do the Blackguards do anything? They are driven by whim and desire. Though the ones who occupy the Teeth seem more like rabid dogs, than raiders. Perhaps the call of Sithis the Destroyer has whipped them into their frenzy.
They were on display in the sacrificial chambers, before the temple was overrun by the Blackguards. I cannot say if they were moved by the caretakers, plundered, or shattered to pieces, but I trust you will find them if you are meant to.
No. That would be cruel. Our spirits go to the Hist when we die. We could not bind the spirits to the bones, even if we wanted to. We're not necromancers!\n\nMaking use of bones honors our dead and gives purpose to their bodies after they die.
How the Blackguards ended up becoming bed mates with a vampire coven, I'll never know. Though I suppose like begets like.\n\nThe champion calls herself Lady Minara, though I'm not quite sure what she's the lady of.
With utmost disappointment I admit that Naga lead this band of despicable outlaws. Blackguards cause trouble throughout Murkmire, but some have targeted the Naga-Kur tribe.\n\nIf they fortify Echoing Hollow, they will be unstoppable.
Once, I watched over the Xinchei-Konu, learning its secrets and sharing its wisdom.\n\nNow I speak the dark words of Sithis, traveling the tribes and spreading its wisdom. A similar task, truth be told.
As I thought. Very well. I'll need evidence if I'm to properly judge. Speak with the two claimants, Nurhei and Paheiza. Seek their truths, yes, but also their lies. Both will help my decision.\n\nIt also wouldn't hurt to check the farm itself.
She demanded the war-chief give her the position. You see, Chukala was her egg-brother. She wanted to honor his memory by teaching novices the things Chukala believed.\n\nThose instructions killed many novices before I intervened.
Oh? Not surprising. We wrote a lot of letters to each other. Paheiza would often conduct business on behalf of her egg-sister.
Bark and birth, I nearly jumped out of my skin! Maybe I should have. It couldn't be worse than what the Skin Taker did to poor Danlai.\n\nDangled like toad jerky from a tree. Not a scrap of skin or scale left on him ….
There is a glade within the swamp, where Tun-Zee first set eyes upon his beloved. It was there that he wished the grave-stake to be placed. As grave-singer, I must grant this wish.\n\nBut perhaps you would be willing to help?
This is the Tree that Crumbles Stones; the change which breaks down stagnation.\n\nOnce, our ancestors made walls of stone with the foolish notion that we could stop that which changes. This tree represents the futility of such thoughts.
I am as sure as I ever am when it comes to fulfilling my duty to Lady Laurent. And with you at my side, how can anything possibly go wrong?\n\nI do wish I had a bottle of something strong and medicinal on hand. Two would be better, of course.
There were similarities, but I question that it was Saxhleel. Maybe once, but not as the thing we saw here.\n\nMy misguided kin meant only kindness for an unfortunate soul, but that small act could carry grave consequences for our entire tribe.
Locked away. Hidden under mud and lost memories.\n\nUnderstand, our egg-sires did not want this truth drifting free on the wind. But Xukas trusts you, so I will trust you. Go to the Wither-Vault. Claim the chime. We will learn its truth together.
Very well. I do hope you will exercise caution. The Blackguards are not particularly bright, but what they lack in intellect, they make up for in brute strength.\n\nOur friend, Xukas, for all his many virtues, is not a warrior.
Yes, I'm familiar with Jaxsik-Orrn. A very proud warrior. Hopefully not too proud. If we have common cause with the Dead-Water tribe, it only makes sense to cooperate.\n\nCompromise and collaboration rest at the very heart of all great endeavors.
The Vakka-Bok was thought to be used by our ancestors to honor the sun. I suspect that some of the sun's arcane power still lingers, giving the aloe its curative properties.\n\nThat is only my suspicion, though. We know very little of the xanmeer.
Yes, with the ultimate goal of reaching the signal totem and igniting it to show that you have completed the first challenge.\n\nTake this arrow and point it whenever you want me to use my bow. Are you ready to begin?
Me? I have never been better! It's bonding season! I mean—I, uh, I'm not … I'm not planning on it myself, but my head swims like a mudskipper so who knows where my night may lead!
I suppose that is true. If I'm to respect the traditions of Murkmire, I must respect its people. And that should start with agreeing to Ereel-Jush wishes.\n\nVery well. I shall sing the words just as they are told to me.
All is as the Hist wishes it to be.\n\nOne day, when he has grown old and thin like me, he may return to the Glade. Until then, he does the tribe's work. There is no shame in that. None at all.
Please, don't mistake my stoic demeanor for a lack of enthusiasm. All of this is tremendously exciting.\n\nBut in answer to your inquiry, yes, the primacy of these relics is a thrilling discovery. It supports a theory of mine—about the Hist.
He did not. He died in glory.\n\nMany great Dead-Water kaals raided the tomb, seeking pieces of Etra—bones or sinew to make mighty weapons. They all died. Now their corpses, and what remains of Etra's, stalk the tomb forever. Like I said … vahat.
We are born of the Hist, shaped by the Hist, and when we die we return to the Hist to be born and shaped anew. Can the same be said of this one?\n\nRee-Nakal gave her life, but can one born beyond the Hists' roots possess a soul? I have no answer.
I know! I know … I can't fix this, but I have to believe I can fix her. I have to.
Show some respect. This wreck is the Dominus Fatum, one of the most storied vessels of the First Empire. Its crew apprehended the notorious Black Marsh pirate, Red Bramman, during the reign of Empress Hestra. A testament to their resolve!
I tried to learn as much as I could when I came across the stories of the Wuju-Ka. I'm no expert, but with the dagger we found, I can replicate the ritual. I think.\n\nLet's go find the altar.
<Remains silent.>
The sap-speaker said that the souls of her tribe nest inside the Remnant, right? If Kassandra could claim the souls of an entire tribe, she might find some way to rule them, to twist them to serve some dark purpose.\n\nWe cannot let that happen.
Just a friendly keeper of the peace, here to make sure you stay out of trouble. Take my advice and I'm sure we'll meet again.
Just keep a swift pace and you'll reach the end of your journey before you know it.
I will raise many cups to you, I promise.
Ah—well, yes. She is a sensitive soul. It is what makes her such a skilled egg-tender, but—and I don't wish to speak ill—the river of her heart is so full that it does not take much to flood.
Death comes in many forms, monsters chief among them—no matter the number of legs. What you face depends on the needs of the Naga-Kur.\n\nNo matter what we ask of you, you will be tested.
One does not stop the other. Tsojei and I will hunt both Remnant and Blackguard. Join the hunt if you wish, but do not stand in our way.
Whatever is best for the people of Murkmire. I won't act without their consultation if that's what you're worried about.\n\nAgain, I may be something of an outsider, but I am still an Argonian. This isn't some purely academic matter for me.
A Shadowscale, but we both serve the Brotherhood in our own ways. I'm glad to see you freed yourself from Summerset's idea of hospitality. You'll find Murkmire far more lively, unless it kills you.
Call it advice from a dear egg-sister. You might not have been born under the sign, but you found your way to the Brotherhood all the same. I admire that.\n\nIt'll take more than the Five Tenets to protect you from the Wrath of Sithis in Murkmire.
Praise Sithis. I thought we might die of old age first.
No, I'm a Shadowscale, but they're often one and the same. We are the chisel to stone. Sithis shapes the world through us, one careful cut at a time.\n\nOr sometimes it wants the slate wiped clean and it sends someone like you.
This one's brother would want us to stay here and defend our farm! Tsazii would be a poor sister and a poorer matriarch of this family if she tucked her tail between her legs and slunk away!
I refused a direct order. Wouldn't give Saulinia my soldiers or my file on the last Dragonguard. So here I am.\n\nHow about this? You can find a copy of the report in my office. If the information it contains helps you, then come back and set me free.
Anything that Kaalgrontiid considers a threat is worth protecting at all costs.\n\nGo with Zamarak and stop the assassins before they complete their mission. May Jone and Jode guide you, my friend.
Maybe.\n\nVazbi is no investigator, but finding something like this near the gate feels like a sign. We should find the person, if only to make sure they are not badly hurt, yes?
Half-sister. And, yes, if it comes to that. Euraxia conquered Rimmen of her own accord, oppressed the Khajiit, and unleashed hordes of undead. Not to mention her damn deal with the Dragons!\n\nIf we don't depose her, I'd hate to see what she does next.
Aneshi. He served as castellan for Rimmen Palace under King Hemakar.\n\nYou can find Aneshi southeast of here, where he now cares for a shrine to the ancient hero, Khunzar-ri. Learn what he knows. Then meet the rest of the strike force in Rimmen.
I hold the title of magnate, though I have no emperor who supports me. Still, my family has led Hakoshae since its founding, and chose to take the title to reflect that role.\n\nIt has been my honor to lead this town for over ten years now.
Stop the process? Why in Oblivion's name would we want to do that? No, we just need to reach the vault and retrieve the weapon before Euraxia's soldiers do.\n\nNow go and examine that puzzle. It appears much the same as the ones you dealt with earlier.
After we finish saving Elsweyr from the Dragons. You are still with me in this, five-claw? You and Abnur Tharn both? We ended one threat but two more remain.\n\nI will go on without you, but I would rather have you at my side for what is to come.
Anequina's memories show me how she once used a Dragonhorn. The Combat Dragonhorn you gave me, it needs to be energized, have its power restored.\n\nActivate the nearby temple relic and I will charge the Dragonhorn.
I ought to bury him here for trying to kill me at the first chance he got. Again. Maybe I'll sell him as an oddity to the next passing caravan of Baandari Pedlars. He'd love that. Honestly I'll sleep better with him on the farthest of the Far Shores.
The priests, silly! You really are clueless, aren't you, plaything? How are you going to win the game if you can't even find the pieces? Am I going to have to dangle every answer in front of you like cheese-stuffed mice hanging by their entrails?
That rancid smelling thing? I can't believe my brother paid mostly honest gold for it. Probably cursed! He should just be rid of it and be done with the whole torrid affair.\n\nSpeaking of torrid affairs … well, perhaps later.
Well, you do seem to look like someone well-equipped to deal with this sort of thing. \n\nIulius owes me a favor, so I'll call it in for you. The trinket is yours. You can find it in a jewelry box behind the counter.
Hotaza the Corpulent often said: "The forgetting of friends is a grievous wrong." Wise words. Tasnasi has not visited him in some time, but this one has not forgotten her. So believe Nazdar when he regretfully declines her invitation.
Mazdurr has dedicated his life to the brilliance of Azurah.\n\nEvery morning, he sings her praises. Every night, he humbles himself with prayer. His days are spent wandering Elsweyr, spreading her fragrant word.
Dusk mushrooms? For Dagaril-dro? What a kind and generous gift to present to this old bag of fur and bones.\n\nStill, even a gift is rarely free. Speak and this one will listen. Maybe even help if it is within this one's ability to do so.
He is. I know he is. But … Moons forgive me, I have such doubts. How could any Khajiit abandon Azurah completely? Especially a Khajiit as great as Arum-Khal?\n\nNo. I cannot afford such thoughts. Not anymore.
Ha! You protect me by clearing the way, walker. This one wants to take a moment to study this gate, in case we must fix one later.\n\nVazbi will be safe. You will stop worrying, yes?
After such a successful investigation, Mizzik is hopeful that more clients will come forth.\n\nWe live in turbulent times, walker. Dragons, tyrants, necromancy. There is no end to Elsweyr's suffering as of late. And yet so much is overlooked.
A mistake? No. I trust her instincts. She will make a good queen for our people.\n\nBut Khamira lets her emotions get the better of her, and she can be reckless. I worry that those tendencies could end her rule before it truly begins.
Yes, I read the reports. Zumog Phoom and his necromancers, working for my despicable half-sister. Such magic leaves behind a miasma of stench and decay. It leads to the mountains to the west, but I can't pinpoint an exact location.
You paint a troubling picture, my friend. Still, we need to celebrate every victory we achieve. I fear such triumphs will be few and far between.\n\nDo you have anything else to report?
Of course, walker. There is nothing more wretched than a hunter with no beasts to hunt.\n\nThey will conserve what we have and protect what remains until the calves have calves. Only great fools would do otherwise, yes?
Not much. I never got around to reviewing the report. You can read it yourself, in my office.\n\nFor some reason, this rumor of a last Dragonguard inspired Euraxia's ire. Maybe because the legends say they were once renowned Dragon hunters?
He blames our pacifist ways for all our troubles and has renounced them. Rakazsa believes embracing our nature as vampires is the only way to protect us from harm, but all he'll do is make enemies and draw them to us.
Zamarak says many things. This one's words jump out of their own accord, like fish leaping from a stream. Pay them no mind.\n\nWe have much to do, walker. Now is not the time to dredge up events that happened long ago.
That's not exactly true. If my power wasn't depleted … well, let's not digress. I'll go to Riverhold and warn Gharesh-ri. We'll make sure the city is ready for the attack. \n\nMeanwhile, you find out what's happening at the Desert Wind Adeptorium.
We came for an ancient secret … protected by the Grand Adept. She put up a good fight, I'll give her that.\n\nZumog Phoom seeks the location of the Betrayer's body parts. I learned where the dismembered corpse was hidden. Now, please, help me.
Euraxia's court necromancer, Zumog Phoom, seeks to bring back a villain from the Moon-Singers' most ancient tales? By Jode and Jone, to what end?\n\nNo matter. Our immediate concern must be the defense of Riverhold. We cannot afford to lose it again.
Who do you want to know about?
I could think of a million things I'd like to do to him, but I'd have time for nothing else. If I had to pick one thing that'd make him most miserable, it'd be watching me win all the accolades he hoped to rob me of.\n\nFront row, Quintus.
Maybe not the most distinguished mage in Elsweyr, but the best Tasnasi is likely to get in the Stitches. She spends more time with her head in a bottle than a book, but once she's dried out, she'll be invaluable for reaching the vaults unnoticed.
Stave off boredom, for a start. Egging a few vagrants to fight for a limp purse is the closest thing one gets to the coliseum around here.\n\nThough it is fun watching brother dearest try to squeeze more gold from this toad of a town.
The Goiter's Gulp? The only thing vaguely resembling a tavern from here to Riverhold. My dear brother and I are the new management.\n\nYou would think the sixth-generation owners would be smarter than to use this place as collateral but here we are.
It's hard to do even when you're not hung over, even if you've had a complete education from the Mages Guild. I mean, I've done it before. A couple times. And it largely worked out fine.\n\nSo, let's give me the benefit of the doubt.
Ha! "Years may befall the river, yet it still flows." The Red Koan is clear.\n\nYou see a frail old cat, but Nazdar is a proud practitioner of the Whispering Claw. You will see.
Was there someone in particular you had questions about?
Because it was our family who founded it.\n\nMy ancestors wished to create a place of safety and peace, where Akaviri traditions could continue to be passed down and honored. A goal I still strive to respect to this day.
"Can and should," wrote Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, " and knowing the difference between them is the cornerstone of wisdom."\n\nWith Vole's ministrations, Nazdar will be back to his former self in an hour, perhaps more. Do not worry for him.
Cud, that's what Khasda calls him. Had him since he took over the Stitches, but I don't know his story. Not exactly the talkative type. Always chewing something.\n\nIf it comes down to it, I'd fight dirty—Cud's all muscle, I'll bet.
Queen Euraxia's tyranny made the Khajiit wary. I don't blame them for that. I just want to show them that not all Imperials are tyrants. That they can trust at least a few of us.\n\nIt will come—as long as we don't turn on each other first.
That is not a tale that Zamarak wishes to tell. Not right now.\n\nBesides, the Grand Adept wants to talk with you. Best not to keep him waiting.
You didn't hear this from me, but he's a thug who thinks he's a king. Sits in Meirvale Keep, counting coin and letting his thugs run the Stitches into the ground. Well, deeper into the ground.
Yes. It is by her letters that I know of Cicatrice's suffering.\n\nShe was a talented alchemist, and hoped to develop a cure for the flu. However, this was many years ago. I do not believe she was successful.
She's simply telling him what he wants to hear. Subterfuge was never Grundwulf's strong suit. That is the crux of the problem, it seems. He longs for the days before the fall. When there was no need to hide and glory was measured in Dragon blood.
Came to that conclusion by yourself, did you? That's what they called me. Has a certain ring to it, but I always preferred my more grandiose titles. Champion. Slayer. Dark Knight.\n\nWhen I am made whole, the cats will pay for what they did to me.
I often wondered who Cadwell was before he became a Soul Shriven. I know the tales of the Betrayer, but I never equated the two. The Cadwell we know is so … not that.\n\nWe'll deal with Zumog Phoom after we save Riverhold. Anything else to report?
I have to find proof that Peryite is responsible for the flu. Or at least something that can be misconstrued as proof.\n\nGather accounts of the flu and I'll join you. If not, I'll stay right here and die in my own filth. Just like Peryite intended.
Zamarak wishes that were so, but if wishes were moon-sugar we would be buried under a mountain of sweetness. If this one had not failed a long time ago, none of this would be happening.\n\nNow Zamarak must perform this rite.
My egg-mother attempted to develop a cure for the Knahaten Flu when it first struck Cicatrice. I am sure she kept meticulous notes about her progress. \n\nSuch research will be vital to learning what happened here.
It is true that Mazdurr is trapped within this cage, soon to be sold off to vile slavers. But it is also true that you have arrived to save him, in this, his hour of desperation.\n\nAzurah watches over this one, always. And so he is never afraid.
The world you see is just a small fraction of all that is, my friend. Realms of Oblivion, pocket dimensions, the Aetherial plane …. The Aurbis is incomprehensibly vast, but many pathways between realms do exist here in Tamriel.
What do they teach young people these days? You've never heard of the great Abnur Tharn? Advisor to emperors and battlemage supreme? No? Well, take my word for it, I'm a very important personage.\n\nYou should feel honored to meet me.
Yes. You're not going to scold me like Caldathir, are you? It's just a frog! A single, hoppy little frog. What harm could that do?\n\nAnyway, he's the one who made me kill the poor thing! And for what? A water-breathing potion. I can't even swim!
Well, news of Euraxia's death has reached her mercenaries. For the most part, they've decided that Zumog Phoom is their new leader. And they're willing to do whatever the Dragons say.\n\nI suppose they think that's better than being eaten.
Aneshi's wife was kind, generous. She cared for me and my siblings as though we were her own children. She could be firm, too, when discipline was required.\n\nPrior to Gharesh-ri, Zaima was the best teacher I ever had. Well, Zaima and Aneshi, both.
Sizenza's prophecy about the Dragons was no deception of the Skooma Cat, and her prediction that they will swallow Jone and Jode weighs upon this temple and all our realm.\n\nWe look to our Moon-Bishop for answers, but none are to be found.
He went berserk. Little rascal started climbing the walls! And I mean literally climbing, like a cat up a tree.\n\nWhile Ak'an was busy prying Eljhan off the ceiling, I slipped my bonds and went out the window. Easy as sneaking past a moth priest.
You are right, five-claw. Violence is never the best way to solve a problem. It only leads to grief. As the adepts say, when an enemy strikes you on the right, also offer him your left.\n\nBut these musings are mist. Let us check on the Dragonguard.
On the edge of eternity Azurah watches over the Gates of the Crossing behind the Lunar Lattice. It is a twilight realm where death's tide reaches the afterlife's shore. Khajiit must pass through it before they reach what waits beyond.
Rakazsa is no fool. Arrogant, but no fool. He knows you are not easy prey, so he did not raise his hand to you alone. Now that he is pursued, he will seek safety among the clan and wait for us to fight on his terms.
Paradise, walker, where Khajiit who followed the true path of the moons lounge in the gentle warmth of the sun on dunes of purest sugar. A place I will never see.
Alkosh is our protector, walker! Though many have shamefully forgotten him, he ensures the steady movement of the moons. Without him, Jone and Jode would be locked in place and terrible things would slip through the Lunar Lattice!
Probably. But she has no reason to believe that a small strike force is attempting to breach the palace defenses. With the destruction of the weapons platforms, she should order her soldiers into the streets to repel our militia.
Well, when the name includes the word ignominy, it's a safe bet that it's nothing good.\n\nI found a reference or two to Mafala, the Clan Mother of Dark Secrets. Probably something to do with her. Gives me the shivers!
Of course not. I simply borrowed it for an indeterminate amount of time. And now you can borrow it from me to shower the battlefield with the brains of your enemies!\n\nI don't recommend literally showering in anyone's brains, by the way. Too slippery.
The adept and the prefect volunteered to scout ahead. They haven't returned.\n\nThat means it's up to us. We must stop Zumog Phoom from reanimating Cadwell the Betrayer.
Somewhere ahead of us, on his way to the temple sanctuary to make the Moons move.\n\nI need to finish my attunement before we face him. So, please, five-claw, let us get on with it.
I'm hazy on the details. To be honest, I'm hazy on a lot of things these days, but I know Tasnasi can't show her face in the Stitches and it's not just Khasda that'd like to see her dead.
Comfortable? No, of course not. But life is full of little concessions.\n\nBy all accounts, pride and malice corrupted Arum-Khal's soul completely. He's beyond redemption. That doesn't leave us many options.
No. I lack the strength to take hold of the Moonlight Blade as I did before. If Azurah still has a use for me, she may pluck me from this place. If not? Then, this is farewell.\n\nStrong will, sword-wielder.
Of course Lyrrsazhi keeps an eye and ear on her honey pudding and the big adept!\n\nThey returned with whispered words about how they eluded a Dragon and reported to Queen Khamira. Then they left the palace and went their separate ways.
Yes, for as long as Hakoshae will have me.\n\nAnd even if that changes, I'll still do my best to help this town however I can. This is my home, no matter who my ancestors were or were not. I realize that now.
Is Rajhin a god? Do gods not have those who spread word of their deeds? This one is but a humble servant to a more deserving master.
Me? No, no. I am not so skilled a thief as to fleece a favorite of Rajhin! Though if something is missing, he may have shown you his disfavor for interrupting his tale.\n\nBest we continue, lest you suffer another loss!
The ancient structure rises out of the jungle far to the southwest.\n\nTo think, a place known primarily as a pilgrimage stop and historical curiosity may turn out to be the site of Elsweyr's most crucial battle yet.
Because he looks like a Gordon. I'm sure you'll agree when you see his face.
We're just catching up on old times! Not that it's any of your business.\n\nYou like butting in so much, why don't you go bang heads with an echatere? Or a wall?
Only loose fragments. The width and breadth of Arum-Khal's soul … it would burst the heart of most Khajiit.\n\nIt will take much more than slaying these Shades to bring an end to the Dark Adept.
There are those among the troops who need the healers more than I, but perhaps a few hours in the soothing springs will restore my strength.\n\nI'll need it, too. I have much to do to help Khamira restore Anequina to its former glory.
Hmm. Are Khajiit born under a forced eclipse candidates for the Mane? I'll need to ponder that. What's this? Kaalgrontiid! I must travel to Pellitine at once.\n\nAttend the ceremony. Say your goodbyes. Then await my message. I will send for you soon.
Around. Someone needed to check on Cyrodiil and try to hold the pieces together. With the central government disbanded and the Imperial City a smoking ruin, any semblance of order has gone the way of the Dwemer.\n\nThe people deserve better.
Right, right. Sorry.\n\nAccording to the legends, adepts of the Hidden Moon Order trapped her up there in that shrine, trying to straighten her tail, as they say—to bring her back from the darkness and make her whole again. Did not work, though.
Well, Ri'hirr has never met a wizard who dines on raw camel meat, but anything is possible, yes?
Pellitine is known for its jungles and ports. The kingdom's large plantations made up a great deal of the moon-sugar trade. And skooma as well, of course.\n\nHowever, despite their differences, the two kingdoms were able to unite to form Elsweyr.
On to the next life, I suppose. Perhaps to my lady, Azura, herself.\n\nWherever they go, they go together. And that is an encouraging thought. Well done, my friend.
The visions strike Cadwell more frequently now. With a greater sense of urgency. Tharn believes Zumog Phoom seeks to reassemble Cadwell's dismembered body. I want you to stop him from completing that task.\n\nThe Betrayer of legend must not be reborn.
As always. The Dominion could use more soldiers!\n\nI do hate to be away from battle for so long, though. My hands are just itching to pick up my bow and rejoin the fight.
This one is still Moon-Bishop, despite her failings. Though her clowder chose to lay the blame for what happened upon the Skooma Cat, Sizenza knows her weakness allowed him to corrupt our minds.\n\nShe still has visions, but she gives no voice to them.
No, five-claw, you give this one much too much credit! He simply suggested some worthwhile offerings. And behold! Through your deeds, Rajhin's humble servant has the makings of a temple of his own. How better could you have honored him?
Once the tables turned on Khasda, his underlings scattered like rats. Those who were loyal to Dasalzo are glad to see them go. Aside from Jubani's complaining and the Avernos' wandering hands, Tasnasi has nothing to fear.
It will hold open a tiny gap in the Lunar Lattice, so our temple might slip between the Moons' shadows! Nestled between Jone and Jode we will surely be safe from the Dragons!
Before you eliminated the Usurper Queen, you heard her talking to the Dragon Mulaamnir. She indicated that they had located the Moon Gate to the southwest of Rimmen as the Dragons had requested.\n\nThe Moon Gate of Anequina lies in that direction.
Not just that. I pieced together his ultimate plan.\n\nKaalgrontiid boasted he would become the equal of Akatosh. And your dealings with Laatvulon and the Cult of the New Moon suggest they were preparing for an ascension.
According to the legend, this new moon presages a time of darkness and the birth of a new supreme being. Kaalgrontiid seeks to make the prophecy come true.\n\nDamn it, I won't have my legacy tarnished by a mad Dragon I inadvertently released!
Ah, the confidence of youth.\n\nVery well, then. Let's get on with it. We still need to find the source of the magic that's protecting this island.
Your aid and this handful of jewels.\n\nFirst, you must bribe Renmus's scribe <<1>> to put us on the schedule. You'll find her in the tavern. Next, you need to speak to <<2>>  in the city's outskirts, just south of here. He can forge our credentials.
You make an excellent point. The Empire no longer exists but Senchal continues to need us. It would be dishonorable to turn away from our duty.\n\nVery well. For Senchal and its people, I will agree to Queen Khamira's terms.
No, but I can guess.\n\nTuro may act the part, but he's not a romantic. He's an opportunist. He won't kill those scallywags if he thinks he can profit off them. Check the caves near the Dream-Drowner—his slave ship. Any luck, you'll find them there.
Quite correct. A former student requires my assistance, but I cannot do what is necessary on my own.\n\nFighting the Dragons that plague Elsweyr seems an impossible task, but the Dragonguard once successfully hunted them. We seek their wisdom.
My entire life. Before the flu and the fires. Before rogues and Imperial thieves brought their corruption. Before everything was overgrown and left to rot.\n\nThis one remembers being proud to live in Senchal.
I'm glad to hear it. I knew Za'ji wouldn't let you down. I'm coming with you. If this Dragon is going to attack Senchal, I want to help defeat it.\n\nBesides, I'm sure you could use an extra hand.
Hmm. Very well. I will join your order.
The Order of the New Moon? Strange. I've heard the Khajiit speak of Bright Moons, Dark Moons, even a Hidden Moon. But I do not know the significance of a New Moon.\n\nWhat about the green stone you saw in the quarry? Did you learn more about it?
Good. We get in, we find out what we can, and then we get out. And if we're lucky, we'll find Lahini along the way.
Of course, me being such a friendly, cheerful type. We'll see what's going on here in Southern Elsweyr. Maybe help out with this Dragon problem they have. \n\nNever fought one of those big boys. That'll be something to boast about.
That it's an exclusive, invitation only…. wait a minute. That is a strange question. I've already been vetted by Lady Ghisiliane's aide.
And lived to tell such a glorious tale! I hear they were mighty battles both, filled with fearsome vampires and fiery destruction. You have proven yourself a worthy warrior, ready to hunt down the Dragon Vahlokzin.
Interesting choice of words there. As it happens, the Dragon hasn't attacked us, but its presence is doing something unwholesome to the land. He's blighted an entire valley near Valenwood.
Regardless of the risks we face, we have a duty to Tamriel to retrieve this Dragonhorn. \n\nAs a blademaster and captain of the Dragonguard, I am quite up to the task of helping you take down this Dragon.
Despite our past differences, the general did come through when we needed him. I extended an invitation and he decided to accept.\n\nOf course, he mostly came to find out what we could tell him about the floating island.
The Sea of Ghosts doesn't suffer fools. Never has. But now, some dark magic's driven it mad! Great gales whip around this island, breaking masts like kindling-wood and drowning sailors by the dozens.\n\nHigh King Jorunn sent us to investigate.
Daini, why can you not just—? Safik's sister is wise and prudent in all things except this business with Turo. You must understand, he hurt us deeply. She refuses to let it go, even as we try to escape this place.\n\nIs she coming soon?
When Za'ji lived here, he used this cove to get away from mother's constant nagging. It was also a good spot to bring the lovely sweetmeats, yes?\n\nBack in the day, Za'ji even snagged a key to the back chambers from a sleeping Moon-Priest.
I did what any proper battlemage would do … I hid. As you can see, I'm in no condition to take on Kaalgrontiid by myself. So I watched … and waited.\n\nHow did you get back here, by the way?
Each pulley features an icon—a bird, an hourglass, or a Khajiit. This riddle must hint toward where to position the two pulleys of each icon.\n\nRemember, "Khenarthi flies overhead. Alkosh stands in glory. The Mane bows before their greatness."
Focus on Vijari. You should see the dro-m'Athra's darkness clinging to his soul. It clings to other things as well. Things closely connected to it. Find them and the tonic will allow you to see the impressions it left on our world.
And cut out the middle-man? Perish the thought!\n\nMiddle-men are the beating heart of commerce and industry! Guybert is a middle-man, Guybert's father was a middle-man, and one day, Guybert's indolent son shall be a middle-man as well!
The dangerous kind! But the greater the danger, the greater the rewards, yes?\n\n<<1>>  offers tasks that you can accomplish alone, and <<2>> seeks groups of heroes to challenge more powerful foes. Believe Tsaraba—they both pay well!
Yes. The others busy themselves with dusty old tomes and fancy rituals. Feh. Chizbari has no stomach for that foolishness.\n\nDid we come to this place to talk or to make war? This one says, get on with it!
Another ship was seen heading toward the island. I'm not sure if its crew are friend or foe, but we must be prepared for the worst.\n\nWe can set sail immediately. Or perhaps you would like to take a moment to become familiar with the crew?
Not yet.\n\nI have a contingent of soldiers stationed at the west sentry tower, just northwest of Senchal. They can let you know the current location of your fighting Dragons.
Let me see that …. Oh, this is terrible! If the smugglers go through with this plan, they'll ruin my uncle's reputation! No one will ever buy his gourmet moon-sugar again!\n\nOh, friend, could you go across the bay and recover the last of our cargo?
Merchants! Weavers! Fishers and farmers! There were no stories of heroes, no glorious tales of adventure. All Za'ji saw in that mural was a life too dull to contemplate.\n\nAnd so this one ran away and never looked back.
I wish I could call it an act of simple altruism. Alas, I cannot.\n\nWith the sudden rise in necromancy, the demand for undead repellant has gone through the roof! A welcome windfall for mages such as my client.
You mean other than the cultists that were trying their damnedest to disembowel us?\n\nWait a moment. You're going back there! What in the Two Moons could possibly warrant a return visit to that awful place?
Let us hope not, walker. Cleansing the Temple of Seven Riddles was a feat this one isn't certain she could repeat. Whatever we face, Adara'hai is sure she can overcome it with you at her side.\n\nOnce more into the darkness, my friend.
More than a simple storm. That much is certain. They were building to something. I'd bet my axe on it.\n\nHopefully the mages back in Windhelm can decipher this scroll and get a better idea of just what they were planning.
Just legends.\n\nJa'darri wore a divine mask, filled with the power of Alkosh. But during her greatest battle, it failed her. She died and joined the Dragon King of Cats beyond even the Sands Behind the Stars.
In times of great need, Ra'khajin was trained to obtain the divine mask from the Halls of the Highmane. Through grueling trials and tests of will, he would prove himself worthy.\n\nAnd then he decided to become a Dragon Priest. Youth these days.
Embarrassing, I know.\n\nI'd spin you a yarn, but you know I'm no good at lying. I got baited into a brawl in Anvil. Somebody called me "Skordo the Soup Spoon." Can you imagine? I let a lot of insults roll off, but poking fun at my name? No way.
One of Za'ji's favorites!\n\nThere once was a Khajiiti warrior, blessed by Alkosh himself. She fought a mighty demon, drenched in ice and death. Though the warrior was able to trap the demon away, she did not survive the battle.
I simply explained the facts. What we know, what we've done, what the cult plans to do.\n\nI can't really pinpoint what exactly convinced him, though I have a feeling he's been considering this alliance for a long time.
Are you planning to rob it?\n\nOh, do say yes. I'm a little bored. I could bring you down before you took seven steps. Maybe eight.
His newfound voice sent Orgnum's storms to the ends of the earth, but even his normal speech meant ruin for all who heard it. He could no longer live at court and risk the lives of others.\n\nHe saved his beloved Sunhold, but was forced into exile.
A Nord cleric in Eastmarch named Breda runs most of the festivities for the New Life Festival. You can find her tent outside the gates of Windhelm, just down the road a little ways.
It's a large cult that's fanatically devoted to Laatvulon. They wish for Dragons to rule over Tamriel once more, and don't care what atrocities they must commit to make that happen.\n\nThere's also the mysterious stone they mine. Aeonstone.
<You are about to enter a Group Dungeon. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
But there's still Dragons in Elsweyr. Cruel, terrible Dragons who want nothing more than to kill and destroy and conquer.\n\nAnd I won't let them. As the Moons are my witness, I'll hunt them all down. Every last one.
Who wants an old rag. No one. The lizard lady behind the bar here might use it to mop up drinks. All its good for. You take it. Maybe Dancer's luck will change.
Oh, yes. She screeched and scowled at Za'ji's blasphemous disregard of his chores every time he returned home.\n\nEventually, mother realized the less we saw of one another, the better it was for both of us.
Dragons have returned to Tamriel. Many fear them, many hate them. But the Order of the New Moon understands the truth.\n\nThe Dragons are destined to rule this land. To fight against them is to die. To join them is to thrive.
This one secured passage on a Nord merchant ship bound for Mistral. Plenty of opportunities there for people like my brother and me.\n\nI owe the ship's captain, Sormund, just a few drakes more. Soon we will turn our backs on this place for good.
That's not what she means. Thinking about what nearly happened to her love fills her heart with anger. Outrage. A desire to make sure no one else must endure such a thing.\n\nKa'ishka understands now why her sister chose such a dangerous path.
This one has seen the strength you and Adara'hai have. You helped Ka'ishka find her own courage to stand against the darkness. She has the strength now. She only needs to know how to use it.
There's more to figuring out this magic than just watching from afar. I need to know exactly how they go about creating them.\n\nWith your help, we can learn everything about that here in this camp.
Granny garbage, or something. I'd prefer to forget.\n\nI thought I'd wind up stuffed and on her mantel with her other precious darlings. Better that than the ones still in the basement. Half of them were just zombies stuffing parcels day and night.
In addition to the refined netherroot brew, Fenn needs information on the Icereach Coven medallions. Plus, we're hoping to learn more about the big storm the Gray Host has planned.\n\nHelp Fenn and Svana at the other camps, then meet me in Solitude.
Sister Balra? The same witch that killed the merchant back in Riften? I'd definitely like to get my hands on that one.\n\nLet's go.
Yes, so Lyris mentioned. Harrowfiends, she called them. An ominous name. And that Sister Balra claimed she was turning me into a monster.\n\nWhat else did you learn about the Icereach Coven?
Not so fast. If we rush down as a group, they'll be on us like a snow bear on a horker. You go ahead. Try to cross the bridge to the main entrance. It's well guarded, but you're more than capable.\n\nOr you could try the alternative.
Isn't it everyone's?\n\nIn my experience, alcohol, in sufficient quantities, can solve any problem. Give me eight—no, ten—wagons of ale and I'll have this entire east-west rivalry business sorted in less than a day!
That's certainly what Tzinghalis's notes imply. Despite how it looks, a plan is formulating in my mind. I think I can create an elixir, but I'll need more of this refined netherroot brew. And we need to solve the mystery of the coven medallions.
Reach witches spreading lies laced with dark magic. No doubt they enthralled Bjora so she'd betray her family.\n\nStranger, if you're willing, I need your weapon once more.
He did. But for what purpose? He told me his name is Fennorian, and that he comes in peace. Hmph. Mischief of the damned.\n\nWe must watch him carefully, wayfarer. Creatures like him cannot be trusted.
I assembled the museum for just this moment, but I think you deserve the honor of placing Petraloop on its podium.\n\nAfter you display the lute, perhaps you could read "Nel's Hidden Loves?" I could use your skill in recovering the other instruments.
No reason not to. Head there while I circle around from the other direction in case they're already on the move.\n\nJust be careful. I'd rather not lose another partner before we actually figure out what we're up against.
Fine, yes. Uncomfortable, but fine. I've done a serviceable job of cleaning my wound. I should have no trouble getting to Solitude, at least. Barring any unfortunate encounters with rough-hewn furniture, I'll be fit to travel after a bit of rest.
The Reachmen leader, Vund, is an alchemist. He created a powerful alchemical reagent. He's going to ignite the reagent and collapse the cavern.\n\nHe's down there now, but there's still time. We need to warn Captain Hingrid!
Damn those Reach witches! And damn my father for being so … so … obstinate!\n\nBut what does the coven want? Are they planning to kill my father? What else can you tell me about this threat to our kingdom?
Not as well as I'd like. Then again, I'd like to cast every single one of these hag-born maniacs into the sea.\n\nLosing comrades in arms … it's a terrible feeling. I just take solace in the fact that we'll all drink together in Sovngarde.
Here, take these.
Never before in my memory. We Nords of Karth have endured raids from the Reach for generations. They're barbarians who pillage and kill anyone who has what they want. Captives just slow them down.
What? No! I … I didn't even consider that.\n\nNo, Lyris wants to do this. And it isn't like we have a whole lot of options. Let's get moving.
Must have been terrible. I can't imagine being stuck down here, afraid that something is lying in wait in the darkness. \n\nWas there anything else?
We don't, but it's all we've got. Even if they aren't connected to the Icereach Coven, taking care of a few of Svargrim's problems might earn us some good will.\n\nNow, let's go check out the back alleys and the Lonely Troll inn.
Finally a bit of good fortune. Thanks, traveler. No matter what you find in the barrow, I need to know. Tell any survivors you see to meet me here.\n\nHafskjar's the only family I have left. If I've lost him too, well …. Just hurry back safely.
Someone needs to warn the people away from Karthwatch. As the last of the Jarl's guard, the duty falls to me.\n\nLook, I'm desperate to know if the survivors made it to the barrow. Whatever gold I have is yours if you'll find out what happened to them.
I heard mention of the Druadach Mountains, but I doubt that was anything more than a false trail. Most of these mining concerns like to keep the true location of their hoard a trade secret.\n\nIs that it? Are you a competitor out to steal their mine?
Not that I can think of. But what does it matter? Svargrim brought the Gray Host down upon us. He's bringing a harrowstorm!\n\nWe need to evacuate the city while there's still time. Some of us will survive if we flee now!
More witches. And this shadowy ally.\n\nIf they really want to claim Skyrim for themselves, they couldn't have chosen a better time. The kingdom is sundered in two. The Skald-King's busy with the war in Cyrodiil. We're vulnerable. Plain and simple.
Oh she died. Very sad. And she never told a soul where to find the instruments. But while reading "Nel's Hidden Loves" I realized it held clues to their locations!\n\nIf we recover them based on her clues, I'll be a legend!
Good. A moment's carelessness can invite the monsters' fangs.
Here, you take the Spirit Summoning Whistle. When I spread the salts, you blow it, and if there are any spirits remaining in the area, the tone will force them out of hiding!\n\nIt's a big responsibility, but I know you're ready for it.
Spirits, of course! Ideally, the ones that have been terrorizing these poor people.\n\n My mentor and I have been given the important responsibility of investigating the mysterious disappearances down here. We're supernatural specialists, of a sort.
The Swords of Solitude militia. Oldest volunteer army in the hold. We've defended the people of Western Skyrim for generations. The high king's soldiers can't respond to every petition for assistance, so we lend our aid for those willing to pay.
Rigurt remembers his Argonian friends taking him into the darkest part of a stinky cavern. At the very back, Rigurt spotted the mushroom. Smelled it too. \n\nIt should not be hard to find. Keep your eyes and nostrils open, friend!
Wouldn't surprise me. Huge underground castle, hordes of minions, obvious megalomania … she fits the type.\n\nThe bad news is purebloods wield far greater power than an average vampire. The good news is … well, I guess there is no good news. Sorry.
My father, listen to me? When horkers fly, maybe, but probably not even then. He gave up on me a long time ago. \n\nI'm sorry. I'm no use to you. No use to anyone.
A parent's betrayal cuts deeper than a sword. But Svana's strong. Stronger than she's been given credit for.\n\nAnd Solitude's going to need that strength in the coming days.
Claudina seems intent on going back to Blackreach. After we help the poor people of this place rebuild, we'll head there. \n\n\nSpirits may not have been the culprits of what happened in Dusktown, but that doesn't mean they aren't down there!
We've enjoyed much progress, thanks to you. The clan is stronger than ever before and our petty squabbles are done away with.\n\nIt's far from perfect, but at least we're working together now.
I do. She's an impressive young woman. Is Western Skyrim ready for Svana? That's the more pertinent question.\n\nSolitude shuns the outside world while Svana reaches for it. We'll have to see how that works out in the end.
Scoundrels like Narsis always try to buy their way out of problems. Then again, a repair like this is costly. Hmph. Very well. It's there on the table.\n\nTell that scaleless idiot that if I find out he stole a scroll, he will be sorry.
Some scholars believe the Dwemer were able to communicate with one another over vast distances through fascinating headwear called miters. \n\nI happen to have one in my possession, and I plan to activate it with the power nodes.
Hmph. Forgotten already? I was the youngest swordthane ever named, when High King Svartr dubbed me. No one could stand against me in all of Haafingar.\n\nI suppose being jailed all those years has thinned my reputation along with my bones.
The thing eats, doesn't it? We know it's smart enough to move lairs, avoid people who can kill it, and use snowstorms as cover.\n\nI've tested the mixture myself. It was all I could do not to eat the dead flesh I poured it on. Still makes me nauseous.
Glad to hear that worked out. With any luck, Fenn will produce a working elixir in short order. Then we can stop worrying about the harrowstorms and concentrate on defeating the Gray Host.\n\nWhich reminds me. Go to the Blackreach camp and aid Svana.
No. No. I will not tell you what is not yours to know. At least, until I can see what causes these attacks.\n\nCome back with the samples and you may learn more.
It's a school, of course. The very best, by any credible assessment. At least it was. \n\nUgh. What I wouldn't give to walk those halls again. This frigid annex is a very poor substitute. Very poor indeed.
You were? Then you saw what they did. Is it so unlikely it could happen here?\n\nAnd I have so many questions to ask you! But, later.
As much as it would please me to flay the flesh from your bones, I have more pressing matters to attend to.\n\nBut know this. As I felt each death, you shall feel it when the harrowstorm takes every life in Solitude. You shall feel it when you fail!
No. Just objects. Fortunately, it's allowed me to continue my research into the Ayleids. It's even given me a few other routes of inquiry. Meridia's shrine on Mount Kilkreath, for instance. \n\nI've got to believe something out there can help us.
You're right. I may not like it, but it's true. I'm sure I cast a good ward, but there are just too many unknowns. I don't want to seem overconfident or brash.\n\nI'll tell Gabrielle everything I learned, but I'll let her decide what to make of it.
No, it was larger than that. Smarter, too. No bear could have gotten up onto the deck and stolen our people from their cots like that.
If you can call it that. Got waylaid by his round-toothed lackies heading into the Circle of Champions. Had two broken ribs, three smashed fingers, and a poisoned gut wound before I even raised a weapon to him.
I'm not a mage, but I can try.\n\nGo with Lyris. Find Svargrim. If this doesn't work, you'll need to stop him before he unleashes the harrowstorm on Solitude. With a storm that big, they'll have more than enough power to resurrect the Gray Host!
Still think you're mad, but I appreciate that you're willing to check on Havil. He's a grumpy old coot, but he doesn't deserve … whatever this is.\n\nYou'll need a key to the house. One of the farmhands should have one, if you can take it from them.
She found someone? I didn't think there was anyone left in Solitude who won't flinch at the merest suggestion of magic. Fighting the Shademother won't be as simple as slaying your typical hagraven, if there is such a thing. She's far more powerful.
That, at least, will be simple. Simply hold it before the fallen victims and pray for Arkay to deliver them from evil. It will consecrate the remains and release any lingering spirits from this world.
All I know are whispers. They say Maxten kidnapped Freiwen and forced her into the ruins.\n\nNaturally, the Jarl dispatched the guards to rescue his daughter. But just as they arrived, a tempest of ice arose that froze the soldiers where they stood.
Besides the looters, there are a number of strange adversaries up ahead. Most of them seem rather lost and confused, but nonetheless confrontational.\n\nIf you could clear a safe path for us, Kireth will stop fretting, and I can do what I do best.
Well, maybe not patterns in the formal sense, but shapes that align with the object you're excavating. These shapes can guide your efforts.\n\nJust remember to be careful! These are priceless antiquities we're digging up, not turnips.
Rebuild. I'll work with Mugha and the others to improve our processes in the mine. Reiterate the advantages while taking their concerns into consideration. \n\nShowing Mazog mercy is just the first step. I have a lot to do.
Ha! Is that right?\n\nWell then. Sounds to me like you could be one of the Undaunted.
Could be that the Elves our ancestors fought soured our taste for magic. Or maybe there weren't enough skalds singing about wizards going to Sovngarde. Might be that Nords just prefer their natural talents.\n\nEither way, magic isn't popular here.
We knew that vampires were working with the coven. And Old Mjolen and I can say with certainty that the feral harrowfiends are byproducts of harrowstorms.\n\nYou think the assassin was one of the vampires in league with the coven?
Precisely. The spell turned my knowledge of the natural sciences against me. Crafty, yes? A lesser intellect might have evaded the trap entirely. How's that for irony?
Because I don't trust the security at the palace. Vampire or not, the assassin had too easy a time getting close to the queen.\n\nBesides, Svana feels comfortable at the tavern. I figured she needed some comfort after watching her mother die.
He was. For a time. Struck me as something of an obsession, if I'm being honest.\n\nFifty years he's been at this Maelmoth business. Fifty years! Can you imagine? That might be a reasonable period of study for an Elf, but for a Nord? It's untenable!
Rigurt samples meats from all across Tamriel. Some squirmed! Some barked! Some fought! But it was in Greenshade that Rigurt ate the finest cuts. \n\nI don't know what kind of animal it came from, but Farethor said it honored the Pact!
Of course I am! I just need a moment to reflect.\n\nAfter tasting that meal … I don't think I'll ever be the same again.
Who can say? Western and Eastern Skyrim split on bad terms. No point trying to put gravy on that pig. But while the East has prospered, we … well. Life's not bad. Could be better. Jarl Morryn and Rigurt will tell us how much better it might be.
They started off faint, like a low murmur. As the storm grew, we could make out words. And laughter. Like from a child.\n\nThen we saw the spirit in the storm. A young woman running toward us through the field. I've never been so scared.
Indeed! Count Verandis provides a safe haven for our kind and teaches us how to live with our special gifts in a manner befitting nobility.\n\nIt can all be a bit suffocating, but without his rules we wouldn't be any different from feral beasts.
I may have crushed a family heirloom under a millstone last year. I'm here in Solitude now hoping to wait out the ire of said family.\n\nIn my defense, it needed to be done. That thing was cursed.
As I said, she was a conjurer of death. From what I have seen, her magical understanding is incomplete. This curse is wild and sloppy. She approaches power like a babe crawling into a giant's camp.\n\nA shame that Freiwen became caught in it.
Thanks, I won't forget this.\n\nNow untie me so I can get my sorry hide out of here.
Made childhood in Summerset a real treat, let me tell you.\n\nWant to see a High Elf's face light up? Put them in a room with someone they perceive as fundamentally flawed. It's gross. But also hilarious. We're so insecure, you know?
No, no. Practically everyone does.\n\nI was born with a twisted spine. It makes walking … well, impossible, to be perfectly honest. The chair grants me a degree of mobility I wouldn't have otherwise.
It sounded like she was trying to convince him to sacrifice someone for her immortality. That's worse than anything my family ever spoke of. No one ever mentioned a woman. Hagridden was never married, that I know of. Who was she?
That was always a mystery to me. I was told he forewarned the Reach of an attack, but no one ever said why he betrayed his own soldiers. It never made much sense to me.\n\nI feel betrayal in my heart, but … he sounded astonished by the accusation.
Yes, of course. Narsis Dren is always true to his word.\n\nIf you assist me in following the clues laid out in Maelmoth's journal, I will gladly share the wonders of his Mysterium with you.
Yes, of course. Narsis Dren is always true to his word.\n\nIf you assist me in following the clues laid out in Maelmoth's journal, I will gladly share the wonders of his Mysterium with you.
You're right. We will. But part of being an Orc is starting with less.\n\nWe'll find new deposits. Maybe stretch our operation to the hills east of the stronghold. The Nords won't like it, but you know what I say to that.
I spent so much time thinking about this moment that I don't know. There she is, but things have changed. She has changed. We need to get to know one another again.
I don't want to do that until I have more information. Verandis and I … we're …. Look, I'm not just going to run in there and hurl accusations at him. Especially about something this serious. \n\nI want to figure this out before I confront him.
Ard Caddach and his people carry on and life continues. The deaths, though … the soul has been ripped from this place. They still don't fully comprehend what happened.\n\nI doubt they ever will.
An excellent idea, though you might have to get creative to reach the very top.
Yes, we grew up together in the Ghostsong clan. I was furious when the clan banished her. I almost followed, but I couldn't. The clan needs my protection, especially now against the Gray Host.
I suggest you try to use a shard to propel yourself through one of the void portals.\n\nThe risks are significant, but if we can turn these strange pockets of energy to our advantage, we have to attempt it.
I don't know what to think. Maybe he was forced to join them, or lied to, or tricked, or—you know what? Speculating is pointless.\n\nWe have an island to find. Let's get on with it.
It's somewhere inside or beyond an old Dwarven ruin? Wonderful. Good thing I brought my construct-busting axe.
More than ready. I've sworn my blade to thrones and causes, but my blood and bones are Nord. If Rada al-Saran thinks he can ravage my homeland and get away with it, he's about to be very wrong.\n\nBesides, who else is going to watch your back?
Becoming a briarheart is considered a sacred, worthy tradition to the Reachfolk—if done appropriately. It's not inherently evil. \n\nThe Thornroot clan defiles the ancient ritual by abusing it for their own selfish purposes.
Truthfully, Svana. When we learned that Markarth suffered an attack like the one you narrowly prevented in Solitude, she insisted that we offer aid. Ostensibly, to stop the Gray Host, but it seems we're a bit late for that.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to give Verandis an earful.\n\nI think I heard the ard calling for you when we were talking to Arana. They're making some proclamation in the audience chamber. Better not miss your accolades.
No, we did everything right. There has to be something interfering with the ritual itself. The offerings were made. Something else is at work here.\n\nDo what the shaman asked. Examine the ritual pyre and see if you spot anything unusual.
Bah! You speak with that half-giant's tongue. What business is it of yours what I do with my land? I gave that parcel to Mannimarco years ago. It was his to offer to Molag Bal as he pleased. Why dredge up such dealings now?
Everything I'd heard about Arkasis paints him as an egotistical, self-proclaimed genius and obsessive dabbler. I don't see him agreeing to mass produce these husks himself. He'd think it's a waste of his talent. There's got to be more going on.
It's a bit easier to follow than Arkasis's scribbling and it's in Old Aldmeris. Theories on the nature of souls. Their connections to each other, the world, the planes of existence. Heady stuff.\n\nSomeone wants Arkasis to study this, but why?
That's because you aren't a vampire or a werewolf! Hold on, I've got just the thing. Here, a blood pendant. It lets me share some of my vampiric essence so you can see the sigils too. It's perfectly safe.\n\nAt least, Fennorian said it was harmless.
I did just say they were unspeakable, yes?\n\nApologies, it's just so hard to think back on. They kept us in cages. Barely fed us. Mindless fiends would stagger by our cells, growling. A strange creature would come by and whisper an unnatural language.
Extremely similar. Well, I suppose most prisons look the same. But you're right, these felt more like livestock pens, just like those in the Keep.\n\nWe need to find out what Lady Thorn did with those prisoners. And what she offers the Ashen Lord.
The Reachfolk possess a distinct culture that you'll see during your time here. They also enjoy the same capacity for virtue and evil as Bretons, Nords, and the other peoples of Tamriel.\n\nAnimal skins don't make one a barbarian. Actions do.
I appreciate the sentiment. The Ravenwatch seeks to build a world where mortals and supernaturals can live together in peace. The Gray Host has a different idea, which is why I've come to stop them.\n\nI give you my solemn oath—you can trust me.
An appellation he earned, as I understand it.\n\nArd Caddach is said to be ruthless and powerful, a cruel leader who seeks the ruin of Tamriel and the death of any who reject the spirits—or what you and I call the Daedric Princes.
A good question. We know that Rada promises freedom to the Gray Host. He spent centuries bringing the various elements of his plan together. How the Nighthollow fit in, I can't say. At least not yet.\n\nHopefully, the answers await us in the keep.
They're both part of a broader conspiracy, but how they both fit into the overall picture is still a work in progress. Lady Thorn sent some documents to Arkasis related to whatever they're plotting. I'm hoping that's the missing piece to this puzzle.
Look at what we know so far. Arkasis' research started long ago, before the Gray Host even existed. And Lady Thorn's documents discussed a group that started the Gray Host.\n\nWe need to understand more about the Gray Host's origins.
There were. Skyrim, too. It seems that, long ago, the first clans established an empire beneath the surface. Even Verandis thought it was only a legend. But we're finding more and more proof every time we enter a new cavern down in Blackreach.
As an outsider, you may not understand. The wards are dedicated to the most revered spirits of our clan. In exchange for offerings, they provide blessings.\n\nUnfortunately, the storm disrupted the wards. The shaman sent me to restore them, but ….
That's what I said—it's unnatural! It was unlike any magic of the Reach that I'm aware of. What that storm did to our people, it's an atrocity! Whatever created that storm has poisoned our land. There will be a reckoning.
Of course she is. She's a vampire, after all. We tried to slay her twice without much luck. Quick as a spooked hare, that one, and twice as cautious. We'll have her fangs soon enough, though.\n\nYou can read? What else does that sheet of paper say?
But I didn't win. I didn't lose, either.\n\nI could not accept a draw, however. The cold reality of my imperfection. That resentment drove me to Molag Bal. It took the patient wisdom of a friend to break perfection's hold on me. Now. Your turn.
Not when your purpose is worthy. I do what I do for love.\n\nMy turn. Your ally. Are they a High Elf?
Not in and of itself. He wants me to follow in his footsteps. To see what he did and learn the truth of what he promises. In doing so, however, I will discover how to stop it.\n\nHe's baring his throat to me, confident I will not bite. But I must.
Have you lost your senses? How could you miss those storms? And the screams in the air?\n\nBands of the beasts sweeping across the Reach from here to the northern shores! Vampires and werewolves joined forces—calling themselves the Gray Host.
Incredibly so! Those lucky few who receive a response from Aetherius often keep it a secret. They do describe it as a life-changing experience, though.\n\nI choose to believe those who receive responses were in need of a sign, for whatever reason.
That is a rare and ancient tale. One not often spoken of, let alone shared with those from beyond the clans.\n\nTell me, outsider. Why does this story matter to you?
I can only speculate, but we know the Nighthollow clan had an intimate connection to the Void through the Dark Heart. It makes sense they studied it over the many years that it sustained them.\n\nI noticed an archive in their keep when we were there.
Good! Nice to see you thinbloods aren't all hare-bladder cowards after all!
Listen … I sensed something else down below … a second keystone. Find it and you'll be able to … enter the orrery chamber.
You're speaking to a vateshran of the Reach, not one of those dapple-trousered bards you find in outsider cities. The history of the Reach, its people, its relics … I know them all. Because if I didn't, they'd be lost.
The fool! That's a strange match. I knew they were childhood friends, but marriage? \n\nWhat else did he tell you about it?
All of this suffering from a broken stone. My father didn't heed the vateshran, but I'll make him hear me. This feud is stupid. The time's come to end it.\n\nIf Eslyn's ready, then let's finish this.
If there's anything this day has taught me, it's that there is a chance for my people to reconcile. Eslyn is nothing like I expected her to be. Even if we are not to be married, that doesn't mean what transpired between us has to go to waste.
Thank you, outsider. I'm glad someone approves my decision … even if they're a stranger to my land and its ways.\n\nNow I just need to hope that Eslyn won't hate me for this, and that someday the two of us can still bring about peace for our clans.
Used to be a watchtower, I'm told, but it's been a ruin as long as anyone can remember. Draugr lurk in the tunnels under the hill, but the ruins above are defensible. Briar Rock's always been a refuge for clans in need of shelter.
Any death has significance, great and small. One died for disrespecting the Lord of the Hunt, the other defending him. That is the way of things.\n\nThank you for bringing this news to me, wanderer. What will you do with the sacred relic now?
Yes. I was dying. I prepared to end my suffering when Arana touched my hand. She said my name was kingly. That my story was not meant to end that day. After that, the rest is a blur, all fire and chanting and poultices. \n\nArana had healed me.
The Hunt-Father teaches us to utilize the bounty he provides. We hunt game not only to feed ourselves, but we use every part of it to clothe and arm ourselves as well. \n\nIn this way, we honor our ancestors by living as they did.
A particularly vile Xivkyn waits for you with one of his creations. Also, some ghastly new kind of creature called a "titan." Never saw one of those when I was alive.\n\nSeriously though, watch out for those banekin. They're a sneaky bunch.
See that molten orb? Strike it with all the power you can muster! Then, take a step in the lava. It won't kill you. I promise.
Of course he cares! But while a lone wolf can be a noble hunter, few can survive for long without a pack.\n\nThere's no dishonor in asking for or receiving aid, but there's plenty of honor in a successful hunt. All that matters is we succeed.
I took a job cooking for the Starsinger clan in Cyrodiil, in the days of Emperor Moricar.\n\nI'm afraid I got caught up in a clan-feud. An assassin crept into my own kitchen to poison a feast I was preparing. I killed the swit with my own cleaver.
It means what it means. We're tied to each other now. What happens to one happens to both.\n\nThinbloods make alliances with ink and parchment. We do it with fire, and oath, and spirit-signs. I think you can guess which practice is stronger.
Well, it shares some similarities with Ayleid welkynd stones, but as far as I know, the Ayleids and Dwarves had little to do with each other. It's puzzling.\n\nMagicked stones often serve as power sources, as well as keys and even weapons.
Initially? Not even a little. There are a lot of things I've been meaning to do with Sai that should keep me occupied for a few weeks.\n\nAnd when we do get restless, I have a knack for stumbling into the next threat to the realm. We'll be fine.
I don't appreciate those sorts of dark jokes. Not when I have my family's life at stake.\n\nThankfully you only jest … right? What am I saying—of course you do.
I'm going to sharpen my sword. And wait.\n\nIf you and the noble plan to fight the Gray Host, I won't stop you. But remember—Markarth is more than Dwarven stones and high walls. It's strength. Make Arana understand that. That's how you can help.
Certainly you saw her on the way in? The Binder restrains the bleed between this realm and Oblivion. Without her and the other sisters, the great spirits would overrun the Hollows.\n\nThe effort makes her a bit off. But I hear she makes a great stew.
They are my family. You as well. I had not confided in anyone since Rada, until you took up my cause.\n\nI … I would like to bequeath my name to you, if you will have it.
The Ambitions? I heard that term once before, years ago. I must go to Tidewater Cave. I have a cache hidden there and I need to check my records.\n\nMeanwhile, I suggest you find Jirich's files. She kept them in a hidden compartment in her nightstand.
Who would remain behind that could stand against Rada? I fear that even together we would be hard pressed to stop him. We'll need every advantage for the end battle, should it come to that.\n\nPerhaps if I can learn how to call upon the darkness ….
As I approached, she demanded to know the location of the Waking Flame. I explained they took our people into this mine. That's when she offered her deal.\n\nI don't know why I said yes. I'm not a fighter. Maybe I'll die in here. But I have to try.
Nope. Vandacia made this personal, but I try to not make a habit of killing people for free. It's bad for business.\n\nYou do what you have to. Me, I'm going to find a nice mammoth steak with a side of vegetables smothered in scuttle cheese sauce.
It could have been worse. We did well against the cultists. They were not trained soldiers. And when Mehrunes Dagon appeared, we faded into the mud and grass. Dagon did more damage to his own minions than he inflicted on our forces.
Then you shouldn't have any trouble picking up one more.\n\nNow, do you mind? I need to educate this dunce on the finer points of self-preservation. Again.
There aren't enough of you to stop Vandacia. He has an army of elite soldiers, crazed cultists, and Daedric creatures given to him by Mehrunes Dagon personally. You're hopelessly outclassed.
Honest toil. Zenithar provides to those who work. Just as the seal kept out the war that raged between the trade-ministers, the cracks let in the rain, and the roach, and the rays of the sun. These were my wages for care of the anvil, and prayer.
Tiras is an incredible talent. Of the sort that only appears once in a generation.\n\nWhat's more, his family is extremely well-connected, he lives the Telvanni creed effortlessly …. I wager he'll be Archmagister one day.
Look around and see for yourself. The very fact that you stand before me proves that you didn't stop me. You didn't save the Ambitions. You didn't save anyone. I destroyed you.\n\nNow this realm belongs to my lord and master, Mehrunes Dagon.
The Sul-Xan are a savage people, Nagas who revere the forces of death and chaos. You must traverse their land to reach the pit of the outsider.\n\nThe Nagas recognize no authority other than themselves and their leaders. They do not welcome visitors.
What are you? Some sort of adventurer? Yeah. Yeah, you look the part. Sorry I was short with you. Since Igmund passed, I've had to work twice as hard and twice as long to run the inn. It's done my manner no favors.
The wards not only serve as powerful locks, they are designed to specifically keep Daedric entities such as myself from passing through them. While merely an annoyance for a mortal, to me the wards are … deadly.\n\nEnough. The Daedric vault awaits.
Indeed? Very curious. Still, I'm hesitant to take the word of an admitted killer at face value. Not with so much at stake. Regardless, their very presence still poses a threat to all of Blackwood. The sanctuary cannot be allowed to reopen.
Excuse me, you don't even know me. I—I am Annyce. I can prove it. Ask me anything.
They have a look about them, one I've seen before. It's the look of a skooma addict, sick and desperate on the street. Lost without their escape.
We already knew this concerned Emperor Leovic. And I cannot read those coded words. As much as this mystery intrigues me, it has also begun to bore me.\n\nIf we don't solve some piece of the puzzle soon, I may just look elsewhere for entertainment.
Let me take a look. Hmm. Imperial, all right. Specifically, this is Emperor Leovic's personal code. Luckily, I know it well.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have Leovic's signet ring. Without that, I can't decipher the code.
Obviously, we have to protect them. Get them somewhere safe. Especially since we're the ones who unlocked their vault and gave the cultists a way to get inside.
I am! Mostly. But yes, I have a personal stake in this. Phalevon is a distant ancestor. I grew up on stories of his battles, his magic horn—\n\nOh. Could this be about the horn?
The cultists are after the cache, too? That explains a lot.\n\nTheir leader is someone called Doombringer Eshil. And he's got some kind of scholar-lady following him around like a sad puppy.
The cultists are after the cache, too? That explains a lot.\n\nTheir leader is someone called Doombringer Eshil. I know, right? He's got a scholar-lady who follows him around like a sad puppy.
Good, hopefully he will be willing to appeal to his superiors. Regardless, I will make sure he is freed. \n\nTake this. It is a ward that will unlock the main entrance of Xal Irasotl. I will gather as many warriors as I can and meet you there.
Each nisswo is different. I choose to honor Sithis by ensuring that the unavoidable truths, such as fear, death, darkness and change are not compromised.
Because I owe them for besmirching the good reputation of the Dark Brotherhood and for ordering the deaths of my brothers and sisters. And because now I'm curious. It's like an itch that needs to be scratched.
Skooma smuggling would be my guess. I haven't seen any obvious signs in the area, but caves like this are the perfect place for shady dealings. And the idea of trading in illicit goods would appeal to Quistley. \n\nUntil he had to actually work.
Can't say for certain. She only just returned and I can't say the girl and I were all that close. I'd just assume the worst if it's all the same to you.
I—I can't say. Just a feeling in my gut. Got to watch her a while yet to know for certain. If she's like Cylle the eyes'll tell. Mark my word.
Foolish! Witless! They wish to reach the Lady of Shadows and call her attention to this place of mud and dirt. Feh! They intend to channel the power from my Court to open a gate to her realm. But her power is not theirs to wield!
A long-lost shrine that was once dedicated to the demigod Morihaus, the Man-Bull. It's said that Morihaus was the father of all Minotaurs, so I suppose I'm not surprised that people digging around in one of his old shrines angered Bhrum-Koska.
Dead? Oh, Heseph, I never wanted that ….\n\nI … I suppose I need to talk to him. Like we used to. He deserves that much.
As a mortal, you are immune to the harmful effects of the protective ward. As long as it is in place, however, it will prevent either of us from passing through the warded doorway.\n\nThat is its primary function, after all.
A shame. Boisterousness aside, he can be quite entertaining under the right circumstances. Still, it's good to see you well and still about your travels! I figured you'd have been eaten by a Dragon by now.\n\nI jest, of course. Don't give me that look!
It's a place where they can lead many lives, travel the world, and wear any mask they like without question. I can't think of a better place for Cres to make their dreams a reality. Just not quite so literally.
Once, I fashioned a thin, nearly invisible film made from dried cow spit and chitin.\n\nI put the film over my friend's privy late at night, knowing that first thing in the morning, he would need to … relieve himself.
Only the basics. My great-great grandmother lived in Gideon for a time before emigrating back to Sentinel, and she brought back all kinds of stories. Some joyful, but most tragic.\n\nI just wish I could have met her before she passed to the Far Shores.
… no knives … have you shouted … Satul-Sa ….
Oh, well they are very ripe. Pungent—er—potent, you might say. And after a few too many that porker becomes quite puissant. A veritable stench-breathing, drunken Dragon!\n\nBesides, the more you keep from him, the more Jad'zirri can mash for you!
Eveli's an adult. She doesn't need my permission to get into trouble. She's good at that. And she's good at getting out of it, too.\n\nDo I worry? Of course. But I can't tell her to go home. I did the exact same thing at her age. Plus, she's got you.
She's the reason any of us survived past the first few days here. She kept us sane. Devised a plan to escape. She gave us the hope we needed. She was like Mother Morrowind herself.\n\nI wish I'd been there for her.
I'm wagering there is a greater lode of this clouded glass somewhere in the ruin—a stockpile or something that dwarfs these other varla stones in size, potency, or both.\n\nTiras should eventually find himself there.
Argonian musicians prize singing frogs for use in their instruments. Specifically, a strange device called a vossa-satl. The frogs that live in the area around the Panther River are supposed to have a unique chirping call.
An Argonian behemoth, to be precise. He's as big as an ogre, and not quite as smart. When Xeemhok gets bored, he attacks travelers and rampages through the countryside. Someone has to stop him.
Honestly? In a lot of pain. I think that Baron Zaudrus monster did some real damage.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. Not really. I can push through it to find my father. So, let's go.
We're bound for a place called the Keywright's Gallery. But first, I need to know you can defend yourself. Hurtling through the Aurbis and falling flat on your ear left you a bit scattered.\n\nFind a weapon and we'll work out the cobwebs. Fair?
Well, uh, I don't want to risk those angry Argonians getting these creeper seeds again. So I reckon I better head to Gideon quick as I can. \n\nDon't think I want to take these seeds to the Green, either. Too dangerous. I'll set up shop in Gideon.
One place to sleep. Yet two mugs on the crate, both unfinished. And, of course, two sets of footprints heading south—into the marsh—dancing all the way.\n\nThe only way forward is to follow in their steps. Shall we dance too?
Yes. That's what we call them, anyway. They're magic trinkets that let us speak at a distance.\n\nWe found a pair of them in an Aldmer crypt back on Summerset Isle. I don't much care for magic, personally, but these stones are too useful to pass up.
He's a criminal. His primary interest is gold. This ring, for all its gaudiness, is worth plenty.\n\nLarz-Tul may not even sell it. He'll like the idea of wearing it around town. A lesson for those thinking of skipping out on their debts.
The many truths of Sithis cannot be contained within stone and walls. As a prison for the sorcerer, we valued the structure. But with that threat subdued, we shall just ignore the place and watch as it eventually crumbles to dust.
On account of all the doors.\n\nThe Gallery's full of ancient gates, each with some arcane connection to places in Tamriel and beyond. Once the gates came to life, rifts opened. You fell out of one of them. The Daedra, Shyazzel, emerged from another.
Enter and be tested.
I couldn't help myself. All these incredible volumes turning to ash—I just wanted to save something. This journal was resting on a desk as I ran past, so I picked it up.\n\nOf course, the one item I decide to save is completely illegible.
No, no. Maybe. We'd sit down for meals together and tend the farm together, but there's not much to talk about in Farmer's Nook. Another field planted, another day gone by.\n\nWas she trying to tell me something? What was she trying to say …?
I would not have suspected anything amiss had I not known of what happened to Igmund and Cylle. There was nothing sinister in his look or manner. If anything, he regarded me more warmly than he had in years. Normally, he could go days without a word.
You know, you might not have made a bad member of the Winds yourself. We could use another.\n\nThink about it.
I am betrothed! An arranged match, but a rather good one. \n\nI have a Silvelle heirloom—a ring—to present to my affianced. Or rather, I had it. While enjoying the end of my bachelorhood I, well, lost it gambling. I need that ring back.
I can tell you speak the truth.\n\nIn the name of Keshu, I claim the Breton, Faric Gemain, as my charge. I place my hand upon the Hist and swear—no harm will befall him here, and the truth of this will come to light, no matter how grim.
Only that I had no family left, and I should be grateful that they took me in. \n\nIn time, I learned that my father was the last of the Hallixes. My mother, though … I asked Lord Silvelle about her family a time or two, but he never said much.
Right. You're right. This isn't the time to lose it. There's still hope for the others.\n\nGhalor couldn't have wandered far like this. There must be another ritual site nearby. Let's go!
It's not far. Pretty much dead center of the city. The place is called Armor and Fine Garments. Keshu suggested we should ask for a tailor by the name of Percius Loche. He's supposed to know his stuff.\n\nI'll meet you there!
We go to the party! It's taking place in the gardens behind the governor's mansion.\n\nTo think, this all started because I was curious about a coded journal I found in Emperor Leovic's old retreat. We figured out the secret and now we celebrate!
Of course it does! Nothing has been easy since I found that strange book and started chasing down Leovic's secret.\n\nWell, are you still interested in solving the mystery of the Ambitions? Will you come with me to Bloodrun Cave?
Leyawiin demands, does it? Very well.\n\nThis sanctuary belongs to the Dark Brotherhood. It has for a very long time. I've been given the joyous task of reopening it. I assure you, we're a business. We have no designs on Leyawiin or the councilors.
Did he? Oh, I'd prayed that one of the guards had managed to get through to him! Elmonde must have … that is ….\n\nI'm sorry, but your companion—who is he? He looks just like someone I knew a long time ago.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Best to focus on navigating the ruin. I seriously doubt that Veyond's shown us all its nasty surprises.
An order of templars who toil on behalf of the Resolutions. Zenithar prefers peace and prosperity, but he acknowledges that they must be earned. The farmer cannot tame the land while strife rules it, so a soldier's vocation is holy work as well.
Argonian, perhaps? It sounds like it, but I'm not sure.\n\nI haven't reported to Councilor Lovidicus yet. Since it looks like he wants to talk to you now, please inform him of my findings. And tell him I apologize I wasn't able to decipher any more.
You're the one who took the job? Forgive my brusqueness. I should have known someone who looks as formidable as you would be here for work, not idle chatter.\n\nI do hope Deetum-Jas stressed to you the importance of discretion in this matter.
Thank you so much! This means a great deal to me. I've been in such a rut these last few weeks. Everything I try to write is as dull as an old blade.\n\nBut knowing the contents of that ruin will surely change that!
It is just something I sense. \n\nI was drawn here by a purpose and a feeling. I wished to study Zenithar, and there is a temple here in Leyawiin. But I also feel as though something important has happened or will happen in this place.
Have you not heard the story of how he saved Leyawiin? It's the greatest tale of all time! I actually came to Leyawiin to hear some firsthand accounts.\n\nHe just sounds so … heroic.
No, unless you count these tiny balls of goo that keep following me around.\n\nLady Laurent says she catches glimpses of other me's in the crowd, but I think that just her nerves. She can be quite tense and irritable if she skips her afternoon tea.
I have great love for him, but we have always been opposites. When we were hatchlings, I was busy bloodying my scales while he was mixing tinctures. He is brave, and he is often too clever for his own good.\n\nI worry for him.
Against any other foe, yes. She is of the Deadlands, the home plane of the very enemies we've found on our doorstep. An outcast Dremora at our side may only serve to draw the full might of Dagon's armies down on our heads.\n\nThink on this.
What is that saying among Cyrods? Love is blind.\n\nPerhaps you are right. Just as I failed to see the wisdom in involving my egg-siblings in retrieving the stone, I may not be able to see the value of patience now. Very well. I will not summon Xyria.
Don't I know. I suppose I should be more grateful to mom and dad for letting me be my own person. I had no idea.\n\nIf my father talked to me that way, I'd have pushed him off a ledge myself.
Yes, both clients emphasized this. \n\nI do not know if all crows are servants of Nocturnal, but these in particular were of special interest. Something about Arpenia itself makes it so, but you would have to ask them for more specifics.
My father was Lord Martel Hallix. And he was a traitor to the crown.
She was questioned rigorously, but the king's agents couldn't prove that she knew anything of my father's plot. Emeric spared her life. But the shame of the whole affair broke her heart, or so I've been told. She died shortly afterward.
To be frank? It's an alliance. The Bouchends have their concerns, thanks to many baseless slanders about me. But the advantages to both families are significant.\n\nI am fond of Mauriene, though. I … want her to think well of me.
Well, yes. The Bouchends are an influential Daggerfall family, just like the Silvelles. I've known Mauriene since we were children. I'm not surprised that a match was made.\n\nFunny. She always seemed to bring out the best in Quistley.
Yes, I think so. Still feeling drained, but I'm beginning to get sensation back in my chest. Really odd feeling, let me tell you. I don't recommend it.\n\nMirri brought me along to have someone she could trust, but I just ended up being a liability.
Lord Silvelle told me years ago that my older sister died. I assumed that she'd been caught up in my father's treason, or had fallen ill and passed away like my mother.\n\nI didn't learn I was wrong until a letter from an old Hallix servant turned up.
It's hilly. What, you were expecting something more useful from a squirrel?
The tailor gave me a fantastic deal on this suit. But we had to set out for this trip before she could alter it. The fit isn't perfect. I'll have to set aside time when we return to have it looked at.
They hid the switch for a secret door under that crate over there, by the wall. Clever, if one is a child.\n\nI cannot believe I thought these weak-minded fools might have a genuine insight into the dark mysteries of Sithis.
Hmm. Now that you mention it, I don't actually remember seeing her emerge from the watchtower. She must have, of course. The only way in or out is through that door.\n\nServants. I guess it's true that you never notice them unless you need them.
I'm a little surprised you have to ask. Morrowind had the most prolific slave trade in Tamriel before the Ebonheart Pact abolished it. The people they preyed on most were the splintered Argonian tribes down in Black Marsh.
I'm not sure how relevant my ancient history is, but I was appointed to the Elder Council by Emperor Durcorach himself. I helped guide the Empire through most of the reign of the Longhouse Emperors.
You mean Red Annyce, the Crimson Shrike? Then you need to head to the thick of it, sailor! As soon as Prince Vaugr's crew boarded us, she made straight for his throat!\n\nLast I saw, she was hounding the cadaver back onto his own ship!
You really do know your Dark Brotherhood stuff. It sure would have been helpful if you mentioned any of this a lot earlier.\n\nAll right, assassin. Is that what I call you now? If you're so smart, go and open the door. I'll wait.
I do not know. And did not feel the need to ask. I sag my tail with regret knowing that now we have failed. \n\nOr perhaps this was its purpose? Nevertheless, I shall try my best to fulfill the will of the Hist.
I hoped a word with the knight commander would prove that the attack was the work of some overzealous recruits, but he's refused to see me or return the relics taken from my temple.\n\nI can offer more than blessings for their return.
Need is such a specific word. I do not need anything, little mortal. I am quite content to find a new distraction and leave your pitiful world to the Prince of Destruction.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to open the vault, I shall aid you as I can.
Yup. And Lyranth thinks they could arrive here at any moment. Let's look around.\n\nOh, hey, one more thing. The book sort of started to tingle the moment we entered the vault. Just thought you should know.
It may fly in the face of common sense, but I think Cres might have the makings of a fine Player. They're a bit … unrefined, but taking on a new role seems to come naturally, and they'll never forget their lines.\n\nI could sponsor them to the House.
That is what I want to hear. A little confidence like that around Stonewastes and perhaps Naxhosa would not have rolled over us like a boulder.\n\nWe should hurry before Elossi changes her mind.
Hurts, but nothing a little magic won't patch up. I wish our retinue had fared as well. That ambush cut them down before they even knew what hit them.\n\nYou're ready to face the sort of enemy that can kill trained soldiers like that?
Let me see that. Hmm.\n\nThis letter names the maggot I killed. Devastator Rullen. And it mentions Greenshade. I wonder what they're doing in that miserable place?
That this Sister Celdina had the audacity to order the cultists to steal my relic. And she gave them the damn blade that incapacitated me.\n\nShe calls the relic a portal key. Claims it leads to some sort of base in Oblivion.
<Placeholder. Replace with RST 13357>
The cataclyst initiative proceeds apace. Sister Celdina continues to make adjustments and improvements with every version of the device.\n\nI understand we're about to witness a new demonstration. I can't wait to see it perform as intended.
Yes. Creatures such as this are usually content to reside in the Evergloam, never turning their sights on Nirn.\n\nAnd it can be no coincidence that Nocturnal's Summoning Day has just passed ….
That … we have not yet determined. But I have a plan. You must follow one of the groups of cultists, trail them to the portal, and take their key.\n\nIf the portal key works like the keys to Fargrave, you'll also need the code to operate it.
The Bladebearers are notoriously wary of outsiders. And they distrust Kyn who have more flexible views about honor and proper behavior than they do.\n\nI walk my own path. Some Dremora find that strange. Ask me if I care.
Yeah, I noticed that straight away. Maybe they were part of a set and this one was Emperor Moricar's? And look, it has some weird runes etched into the surface. It might be important. Hold onto it.\n\nWhat about that journal?
I think so! It's possible there might not be anything left to find, but that's the only place that map could be pointing to.\n\nIt has to be worth a visit! I'll mark its location on your map.
You're a wary one. I consider that a mark in your favor, considering some of the characters I've seen pass through Fargrave's many portals.\n\nAll right, what do you want to know?
Next we need to … think Selveni think …. \n\nWe need to find the statues. There should be an altar in here that's used to locate statues in the Folly.
What? Oh, we'll use it to find the statues of Ordinator Nilera and Grandmother Sovisa. From what I heard in Wretched Spire, the altar is as a sort of dowsing rod. It helps Daedra find the statues they want to sneer at. \n\nThe Folly is very popular.
I don't know. And what does it matter? However we met, I just hope Elegian can tell me who I was before this mask was adhered to my face. \n\nIt would also be nice if he can tell us something useful about the Riven Cataclyst.
They're no less dangerous than they ever were, I don't have the power to destroy such things. The miasma of Daedric energy will accumulate again if these objects remain together, but this should stop the damage until they can be dealt with.
It is one of the seven hundred and seventy-seven impregnable citadels that house Mehrunes Dagon's legions. Nokvroz commands the garrison, protected by a cabal of Dremora blood adepts.\n\nThat's why we need Arox once we get inside.
Soon, you will visit a dark place of lava and fire. Keep your weapons and your wits sharp.\n\nDo not ask Zahsbi for more information. He cannot say.
Then the coward could have done it himself! \n\nIf he wanted to repent, he didn't have to wait for me to dirty my hands. Martus tainted everything he touched.
I came with the spire. Crashed down after being ripped from my beloved Mournhold and flung into Oblivion.\n\nNever really understood how I, or any of us, survived, but I stopped thinking about it.
Bother? You mean, anger? Upset? These aren't experiences that I have. My … moods are set. Fixed. I am who I am. Who I will always be.\n\nEven my search for freedom from mastery is eternal. Living here—just a temporary success.
Madam Whim didn't charge you, I hope. She usually lets you sample her wares for free the first time. After that it gets expensive.\n\nThe Shambles is a big place, but now we know more than we did when we started. Did you also make contact with Tilgo?
You don't know? It is Nocturnal's holy day, the 3rd of Hearth Fire. It is the day we are able to summon her to Nirn. \n\nPerhaps something else was brought along with the Night Mistress.
I extracted knowledge from them. Coercing cooperation however I could. Sometimes subterfuge was enough, usually it was not. Our methods were better left to the imagination. It left scars on them and I both. Eventually, I sought reassignment.
Dagonic codes? Easy as ripping the ears off a Banekin! Arox is fluent in the many tongues of the Deadlands. No code can hide its meaning from the Mutilator's eyes!\n\nSpeaking of eyes, we should leave this place before the Collector looks this way.
I can't imagine she's eager to run into us again after stealing the powers of the Ambitions. Though, that would be a normal reaction, and she doesn't exactly have a history of being predictable.\n\nI think it's impossible to say for sure.
I have some amount of skill at magic that reveals secrets and hidden things. It wasn't too difficult to help the Anchorite make sense of the memory that welled up when the Collector examined her mask.
Oh, very much so! Arox has been there many times!\n\nThe city walls are impenetrable, even by magical means. But I know of one specific location that would allow Lyranth to portal us through, if she is still a part of this.
Just look around the city for sparkling balls of dancing light. I understand they can be quite beautiful. Or find my servant, Hezehk. I sent him to investigate. Either way, you'll run into Lyranth or not. She's stubborn, even for a Dremora.
Business, as always. Clients come and go, and come again. Oblivion will shudder for a time with the echo of Mehrunes Dagon's defeat, but it changes little for me.\n\nThe House of Whims will always provide for those who have need of it.
I am … not shocked by this news. Mortals do not always know when to back away. This makes them exceptional employees, but does decrease their already limited longevity. \n\nYou said you have the gem he was sent to retrieve?
They hired you and you don't know about the Shambles? It's not the safest place to visit in Fargrave, that's for sure. And it's full of rival gangs. If the Errants don't find those shipments, then the Vanquished or the Invisible Web sure will.
No sense standing on ceremony under the circumstances. You can call me Vitellia. I was the caretaker for the Dread Cellar. The prison's been abandoned for quite some time, so I was assigned to try to keep it from completely falling apart.
<You are about to enter a Group Dungeon. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
I escaped a terrifying clan of Reachmen and Minotaurs that kidnapped me. They've been raiding villages and dragging away anyone they can.
Of course, master! The very foundations of this plane trembled with your might! A legion of Daedric eyes and ears bore witness to your victory! Dagon will never forget such a resounding defeat. It was my honor to be a part of something so monumental.
That's a complicated question. All of them, if you want to get technical about it. Everyone wants the best for their big day and many would say that I'm the best. \n\nThey're right, of course.
Gather a few lucent crystals. Preferably a charged lucent. Then we can activate that displacer so you can get up to the balcony.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if you place charged lucents in the discharge labrums above, that will open the cell door.
Was it in good shape? No. Don't tell me, I'll just wrap up here and check with Vaveli myself. Go to her and collect your well-deserved reward my friend. \n\nBy Sotha Sil's grace I am going to learn something today!
If anyone had told me a tale of marching on Destruction's Solace with a band of mortals led by a daedrat calling itself Arox the Multilator, I would have laughed at the absurdity of their tale. Are you ready for this journey?
Bits and pieces, but when the memories stir, the pain kicks in. If I try to focus on them, actually make sense of them, the mask … burns? It hurts me. Like it doesn't want me to remember.\n\nSomeday I'll look into those blank spaces, but not today.
Tephilaz makes his own choices. He is unbound just as I am. If he wishes to walk without me, then so be it. I would not stop him. Though, obviously, it was foolish.
As a Dremora, I'm bound to a higher order. Some bow to the liege they serve. Others hold nothing higher than their own word. \n\nThese mortals … coerced me. I can't deviate from what I agreed to, no matter how badly they try my patience.
He might be able to explain how his Bladebearers came to be at Burning Gyre Keep. If Rynkyus knows more about the Waking Flame's activity in the Deadlands than we do, perhaps he can tell us where Sister Celdina and her device are hiding.
It happens more often than you think. \n\nI should just be handling the Saraathu Tong's finances. But, when you work for a group that transports items between the planes, those finances are tied to the goods. Missing goods mean missing funds.
She's right. Someone wants violence. I can't allow that. Don't know our protection's source. Chaos might end it. I need the mortals alive.\n\nProtect them. Speak to them for me. Learn what they know. And if lives don't interest you, I can pay coin.
Mortals. How did your kind make it into Fargrave when you don't know the rules? The Stricture? The Grasp? \n\nFine. The Stricture's the usual legal drivel. Don't damage Fargrave. Don't kill anyone who doesn't agree to it. That sort of thing.
Gaps. Loopholes. Places to foment discord. Dance a jig along the legal line. \n\nIt's easy for you mortals. You get to choose whether you abide by the Stricture. Daedra have to be a little more clever. And worry about the Grasp.
I wanted to see all the holy sites of the Divines, but there are those who take offense to visitors. I pray to Stendarr and the mercy he is known for that I will be able to resume my journey. If that is not his will, then so be it.
Everything I know about Deadlight is rumor and conjecture. It is a plane that suffered some great cataclysm in the ancient past. A realm forgotten and lost to time.\n\nI had hoped that Madam Whim would know more, but she claims the place is a mystery.
Grandmother Sovisa died protecting me. Ordinator Nilera fought Mehrunes Dagon himself to keep me safe. The Tribunal—yourself included—sent me here to save their spirits!\n\nBut I am nothing like Sovisa and Nilera!
My grandmother served the Temple. When Ordinator Nilera died fighting Mehrunes Dagon, she rushed outside and picked up Nilera's sword. \n\nShe—she wasn't very good at fighting. But she managed to hold the hoard back until you and Almalexia arrived.
I will base my judgment on the flesh's utility. What tasks it can perform, what price its various organs might fetch in the marketplace, and so on.\n\nIt appears to be capable of movement.
Done what before?
Just give in? That's insane. My entire being would be scattered across infinite time and space! But … I suppose there was a positive reaction when others near us stopped resisting change.\n\nI … I'll have to trust in the Eleventh Force.
The Grasp of the Stricture. They're an order of Daedra—mostly Dremora—who serve as arbiters and interpreters of the Stricture, a magical covenant that allows Fargrave to serve as neutral ground for all Daedra.\n\nThey enforce the laws, to a point.
I doubt Nokvroz had the imagination to use Fargrave's unique properties in such a way, but the potential for unintentional disruptions was within the realm of possibility.\n\nRegardless, you've changed things for the better. We all owe you our thanks.
Normally, we cannot. But with our essence drained, nothing remains to return to Oblivion. Nothing to reform.\n\nYou need to know. They have another stronghold. A place called Deadlight. But if you seek the Riven Cataclyst, it's in the fort's citadel.
Yes, master.
They may wear the garb of knights, but the ruffians who assaulted me carry themselves like robbers and outlaws.\n\nWhoever they are, they're dangerous. Be wary of them and may the wind guide you.
Tarrinore's wounds need tending to and I could use something to calm me down.\n\nAfter that? Someone needs to sort the scoria, set up camp, and gather our provisions for the night.
There's supposed to be a cavern farther down the bay, big enough to harbor ships. That's probably where the freebooters were dividing their loot and stashing their treasure. Whatever calamity befell their fleet probably occurred there, too.
No, thankfully. Our trial will be to reclaim the Gilded Lute of Captain Brenvale. The story goes that he went down into the castle crypts years ago, hoping to use song and steel to subdue a spirit. \n\nHe never returned. Hopefully we'll do better.
The entire archipelago sits atop the bones of an ancient volcano. Sheer cliffs, jagged reefs, and dangerous currents make Amenos a perfect site for a prison. \n\nThe only safe landing on the isle is the dock at Amenos Station.
Just a moment! You won't get very far without the key to the deep crypts. Which I just happen to have! Hah!\n\nUm. I tell you what. When that thing surprised me, I may have dropped my sword. Return it to me and I'll slip you the key. What do you say?
Cross your heart ten times and seek a temple, lest you find a druid curse on you as well!  \n\nYou feel that rumbling? I wager this old cavern didn't care for that rotten magic either.
Before I engaged in two of my three favorite activities—eavesdropping and thievery—I heard the jailers talking about a bounty placed by the Green Serpents prison gang.\n\nThey're offering a reward for three nobles that washed ashore in the jungle.
Just some old ruins, so far as I can tell. Not the worst place for a secluded hideout, if it weren't crawling with yaghra. Too far from any shipping lanes for pirates to bother with though.\n\nWhatever they're after, it's not plunder.
So Lady Arabelle informed me. I hesitate to accuse anyone, but perhaps you should join me at Castle Navire.\n\nAll the nobles of High Isle will be there. And if my retainers did see something at the castle, perhaps you can determine what that was.
I half expected to find our young Nord prince sitting atop a pile of dead Serpents. But no such luck.\n\nLet's take a look around and see if we can find anything that points to where the Serpents might be holding Jorunn's pup.
Yes, but is that druid acting out of malice or ignorance? Either way, if the Evergrowth succumbs, then the corruption will increase and spread out of control.\n\nWe must take this news to the circle elders. Meet me in our village.
Hah! I could make a career of it, if I thought I had the patience. I'm still not sure how Jakarn got entangled with this whole affair, but you can be sure a pretty face is involved.\n\nLet's just hope the poor fool is still alive.
Help me investigate. Search the village for any signs that a druid is involved in the corruption. Look in the huts, ask my fellow druids. Someone or something here will lead us to the source of the corruption. It has to.
Ryvana's ritual is somewhat involved, and I'd like to help her prepare. Can you gather some reagents that we'll need?\n\nShe requires three bloomingsong flowers and an azure torchbug before we can begin.
You come to the Trial of Constitution. How much pain can you endure, challenger? We shall soon find out.\n\nFind a way to unlock the exit without dying. None have passed this final room since before Lady Garick sailed.
Not much, I'm afraid. He's an alchemist in Summerset. And he's interested in creating potions and powders that protect against fire.\n\nThat was all Tarrinore and I needed to know. We asked around about him, confirmed the job, and came here.
By using the summons we found in Mistmouth Cave, naturally. Take Jakarn with you and present the note if anyone tries to stop you. Once inside, confront the Ascendant Magus and disrupt whatever plan the Order has in motion.\n\nSimple as that, dear.
The entrance I am aware of is in the northern part of the grove. I will meet you there.\n\nI have never been in the Undergrove, my friend. I have no idea what we might encounter down there. So be on your guard and ready for anything.
I'm afraid that's out of the question. I'm sure you have good intentions, but our dispensary is full of sensitive—even dangerous—materials. It's imperative nothing there be disturbed. Lives depend on it.
Well, I'm hoping to avoid that scenario. But if it does happen, I'm not sure. He's an odd one. I'm too old for him to punish and he's not really the type to dole out discipline anyway.\n\nI think he'd be disappointed. Which is so, so much worse.
I'll survive, not everyone was so lucky. We'll be digging graves tomorrow. Hopefully not for the Overseer. Or his daughter. \n\nPlease, follow her. I can't do much to help against the Hadolids now.
One of the Breton noble houses. They govern Amenos Station and the prison stockade. The whole island is technically under their jurisdiction, but no one cares about the jungle. Well, except for the mines.
Oh, nothing violent. A trusty named Yvara likes to make camp on the platform over there. All I need you to do is steal something from a jailer and place it in her bedroll. Simple as dirt.\n\nDo me this favor, and I'll tell you where to find Valentyn.
It was stolen. Now the weavers of this town feel slighted and their hands rest dejected. \n\nI fear Stigthar and his rowdy band of Greycloaks are behind this. Pah! Ruffians and thieves who steal the work of others. Their idle fingers besmirch the awl!
Valentyn said he needed to check something past the big tree, near where the waterfall plunges down. Head north out of the stockade until you see the river, then follow it toward the falls. My guess is you'll find him in the clearing to the west.
When our pursuers cut us down, we rose up from the sea again and again. We couldn't be beaten, so we were buried. Bound here by that fool's pact until our bodies rotted and moldered away.\n\nPlease, you have to end it. Free us from this.
Valessea crafted them from a master medallion. Lady Arabelle says they're crucial to the success of our mission, but I stopped listening when I realized they weren't worth any gold.\n\nThey're invitations of some sort, but she didn't tell me what for.
I asked the same thing! Lady Arabelle said, and I quote, "Don't be foolish, dear." She really knows how to wound with her words. \n\nIt has something to do with Valessea's enchantments. They permit the wearers to enter a protected location.
Remember Damard's letter to the steward? The Ascendant Order ship, Nereid's Song. It's waiting for the steward in a hidden cove. We just need to commandeer it and sail to All Flags like the rest of the ships in their fleet.\n\nCan I count on your help?
Once you've cut all three mooring lines, climb aboard. We'll do the rest.\n\nAnd don't pull your punches with those Ascendant Order bastards. I lost a lot of good sailors when the Spearhead went down in their storm.
Just wanted you to know. I worked it out with Lady Arabelle. She considers my debt to her paid in full. I think she may have confused me with you, but I'll take it any way I can get it!\n\nSo, go in and enjoy the party. I'm sure I'll see you around.
Ah, Jara? Or was it Jhaka? You're referring to my has-been money maker, I assume. \n\nSadly, you're too late. I sold him a few weeks ago. He was getting slow, complained about being sick. People don't pay for a limp-fisted brawler.
You might not love this, but trust me, it'll be fun! I used to do this trick with Song and Silverslip whenever we needed some extra coin. \n\nI'm going to turn you into a monkey. Then, you run up to Varvisi and distract her so I can pinch the bracelet.
Indeed. They were called Kestrin's Blades. Curiously, they disbanded sometime not long after we were accosted by them in Skywatch. \n\nThough they no longer operate, this one found the name of one of their captains, Guruz.
Oh, take them down with as much violence as possible. That goes without saying. But try not to take on the entire Order by yourselves. Good help is hard to find.\n\nIf you can expose the Lord or Magus's identities, that might be enough to defeat them.
Not even close! I am Count Damard Dufort and you are too late to stop me. If only Lady Arabelle were here to see this. \n\nAh, but she is! My knights found her outside. She now faces justice in the dungeons below. If you hurry, maybe you can save her.
Father never let me get close to one, so I've only seen them from a distance. They're covered in thick shells and have beady eyes. They seem to really like the shoreline and tide pools.\n\nHonestly, they don't frighten me.
If my wife was successful in her negotiations with House Mornard, she'll return with enough sentries to replace the ones we lost. With the Hadolids calmer due to Meryline's song, my sentries will be able to fight them off in due course.
Somewhere where no one knows who I am or who my father is. When I leave, I don't want to feel like I'm still proving myself to him. I'll be an adventurer in my own right.\n\nMaybe Khefrem or—or Summerset? Ships sail to those shores all the time.
Let me see.\n\nThere's that Ascendant Champion again. Lady Arabelle will want to hear about this. But I know this place, Sareloth Grotto.
She pounced upon the angry lumber like a kitten eager for play when last he saw her, so Za'ji made great use of the distraction, as he is sure she would have wanted.\n\nHe expected she would come signal to Za'ji when it was safe to come out, but ….
He showed back up in town flashing some merchant house signet ring. He said he'd gone straight. Spent big, charging everything to the house.\n\nChow-Chow, the cook, knew something was fishy and got the owner involved. Kiv bolted, and I got fired.
Ah, success! You've saved me an awkward discussion with my client, friend.\n\nI thought you'd come through, so I looked up their course. Captain Marso sailed for Rivenspire.
I did. And … agh. I can't believe it. She's been impulsive before, but this? Running around pretending she's Investigator draighing Vale?
Excellent! Hopefully we have enough information now.
Peace conference? Is that what this is all about? Za'ji received orders from the crown. I guess we were conscripted. Once I learned that our passenger was Queen Ayrenn, I was dumbfounded that she chose the Perfect Pounce.\n\nProud, but dumbfounded.
Yes! Kiv owed money to someone named Vetitia Marcott. She's part of a minor noble family here in Rivenspire. Apparently they were a part of King Ranser's traitorous army during that terrible civil war.
Hah, that's a funny thought. I don't think so? But we can ask her. \n\nThe hilt itself is classic Iron Knot. A historic trophy from a mighty warrior who fell in single combat at a crucial battle. And changed history with his blade.
Right now I should say those trees that are blocking the path!\n\nI, Langley LeTarte, arrived here first. My faithful second shall aid me in removing the trees. Then we shall proceed into the woods. You two will just have to wait.
I think they used to be? But no, these days anyone can join. Even non-mages who want to learn the ways of Y'ffre.\n\nJust another little quirk of life on High Isle.
I bet the city does, but that's not our job. We're meant to be traveling back and forth to Amenos. Making sure the prisoners are transported safe and orderly. They're our responsibility.\n\nWho knows who's watching them now?
Unfortunately no. The wards are just to keep the unstable magic inside the bounds of Tor Draioch. That way, I can work on a counterspell without worrying about the original spell spreading.
Magister Irin knows what he signed up for. Taking me on … I'll admit, it's no small feat. But he's never judged me for being the way I am. Which is why I don't want to disappoint him by ruining his tower with unhinged magic. \n\nHe does a lot for me.
Yeah. Read up. We keep an official Roister's Club rules guide right there on the bar. Have a look any time you like.\n\nOh, and try not to spill your ale on it. Damn sea-legged locals don't appreciate a good leather-bound book.
No, friend. We know the Wyrd and we respect their beliefs—druids and wyresses are two branches that grow from the same tree. But we are called to be in this world, not to withdraw from it.\n\nSome circles see it differently, of course.
Well, I used to. Then Lady Arabelle put me to work chasing stolen medallions and rogue knights all over Tamriel.\n\nI guess she's not so bad once you get to know her. Maybe I'll be my own boss again when this is all over.
Yeah, of course! We should start with rankings.\n\nLook around. Every player you see has a place in the Roister's Club rankings based on their experience. That rank determines who they can and can't challenge. It's banded, see? Like a … layer cake!
Attack? No! My claws are dull, see! \n\nI've been told that one with scales like mine is threatening travelers near here. That may be why they walk by and do not hear my cries for aid.
Well, I'm not quite sure. I've never been good about keeping a clear account of such things.\n\nAs soon as we're all done, I'll bring the matter up with Lady Arabelle. She must have a record in one of those journals she's constantly writing in.
I suppose you would call it our doctrine, our religion. The True Way represents a life guided by natural principles and the value and willfulness of nature. All of nature comes from Y'ffre, and the druids are the arbiters of Y'ffre's will.
The druids of this grove belong to the Stonelore Circle. We revere nature, but believe that all cultures have a place here. Some of the High Isle folk refer to us as the friendly druids. We rarely evangelize, letting our work speak for itself.
The alliance leaders, right. I keep meaning to try to find Queen Ayrenn, but every time I get started, more of those prison mongrels rush out of the jungle and attack me.\n\nI love a good fight as much as the next sailor, but I'm exhausted!
Precisely! Since we also know that the Ascendant Order is still looking for the missing royals, we'll use them to point us in the right direction.\n\nInvestigate the three sites on the map and learn everything you can, my dear. Leave no stone unturned!
The Hadolid's origins are a mystery and not my concern. Dealing with their infestation is my priority. Nothing holds them at bay. \n\nEnough talk, our tasks require attention. Go. Find my missing supplies.
She sleeps in the next chamber, but soon she'll awake with my curse.\n\nThere's a vial of my blood in the laboratory across the hall. We can use it to create an antidote. Release me. Please?
If he's not in the library writing verse to annoy fair maidens, he's usually toiling away in Commander Jourvel's offices.\n\nWhy, what has he done now?
Draigh, no! I never thought my knighthood would be quite like this, true. \n\nBut we've righted so many wrongs together. I wouldn't change my decision for all the treasure in Gonfalon Bay.
Well, in my defense, I didn't know it was owned by the Duforts when we played there as kids.\n\nWe also didn't go looking for knightly relics! Which, now I wish we had.
Yes, yes! I mean, we sort of put her in the carriage, because she couldn't stand by then. And we told the driver where to take her, because she wouldn't stop singing.\n\nBut that is about right.
That name is familiar … yes! That was it. I thought he worked for the inn, so I asked him for something for my friend. Dessert seemed very expensive!\n\nWhen I asked him what else we owed him for dinner, he said he was good. So we left.
I did. And thank the Divines, she won the favor of a knight. I saw the witch at Isobel's knighting ceremony, and she gave me a sly wink. Our bargain is met. And my daughter is safe. \n\nThanks to you, second. And Dame Veloise.
Adusa-daro took on almost all of Verandis's duties—I don't envy her for that. Fennorian and I do as much as we can. \n\nFennorian's had the hardest time of it. He still volunteers to investigate every rumor of evil that reaches us.
Emeric is nothing if not reliable. Look at the way the dead Serpents are laid out. Isn't it obvious? He left a trail to follow. It leads directly into the cave just up the path.\n\nGo ahead and look for him.
No. We Stonelore druids know that we can't force our beliefs on anyone. We strive to do our best and practice the way we see fit. We welcome all who want to join, of course.\n\nBut my sister and the Eldertide want change regardless of its price.
Look, I may have exaggerated my distress when we met, but everything I told you is true. They grabbed Valentyn for no reason. And if we don't get him out, he'll be lost forever.\n\nIt's not just the dangerous currents that make Amenos a prison.
It's simple! You find my husband before they process him, escort him to the location I marked on your map, and we all get away before the jailers notice a thing.\n\nTrust me. Valentyn and I have been doing stuff like this since the moment we met.
When Duchess Elea Dufort assumed her father's duties a few years ago, she ordered a complete renovation of the structure. I'm sure she wanted to protect trade in Gonfalon Bay, but she spared no expense in rebuilding the lighthouse.
You were quite stern with them. Maybe the Hadolids got the message not to bother their neighbors.\n\nIf I see them lurking around again, I will just tell them they're not welcome! I can be quite stern as well when I need to be.
Lady Laurent was hired to preserve any items and structures of historical import and make the islet safe for the upcoming meeting. They knew they had a problem with undead, but they never mentioned anything about an ancient curse!
Yeah, she's here. And she came bearing gifts. Skooma.\n\nAfter all this time, you'd think I could just say no, but I plucked it right out of her hand. No hesitation. I told myself I would bring it down here and pour it out in the harbor. But now ….
In part? Truthfully, I think other forces keep me here.\n\nBefore I died, I helped the Roister's Club craft their game. I played countless matches, but always won. To truly know a game, you must lose. Perhaps if I'm defeated, my spirit will move on.
Yes, well … they're quite large and rather dangerous. Otherwise I would simply go collect a sample for myself. But I've been told there are plenty of adventurers on High Isle willing to assist my research by facing angry Hadolids for coin.
It has to be. A priest of Z'en blessed me. It's the festival of Z'en's generosity. And now I find a ray of light pointing out where some amazing treasure is hidden? \n\nThis has to be a sign of Z'en's favor. What else could it be?
Usually? No, no. Most players are in it for the joy of competition. But you know what they say—if there's an uncertain outcome, someone's got gold on it.\n\nI play a lot of unsanctioned matches. Putting skin in the game keeps things fresh.
I tried cities. They did not suit me. My scales need the wind of the countryside. \n\nSo I wander. My scales are happy. My feet are tired. Only my stomach longs for more.
Listen, Galedra there is a hardcore cynic. You can tell from just a few moments talking to her. And even she fell for him. \n\nAs for me and Julles, we're just emotional men. What can I say?
Of course. All Flags Castle must be half in ruins after what I can only imagine was a fierce and costly battle. I'll get with Lady Arabelle and we'll thank the delegates for their patience. \n\nI do believe another celebration is in order, though.
I made it clear to her that I would not bend to her demands. I can make it clear again if I need to.
I'm not going anywhere until High King Emeric finishes up what he came here to do. That's fine with me, though. It'll give me time to sign on a crew and put Nereid's Song in proper shape.
I'm sure that censer won't hold her forever. Once she's free, she'll likely be quite angry. I suggest you leave this place before that happens, champion.
Yes! And what fragrant challenges they are! Each day, Kishka sets new tasks for rank and renown.\n\nOne will pit you against the common folk of Tamriel. The other will set you against card-playing adventurers like yourself.
Don't be. Raenobi was … honestly, I don't know what she was to me. A friend. An enemy. A lover. An abuser. It's just … I don't think I'll ever really untangle it.\n\nWhatever the case, I'm better without her. It's a hard lesson I'm still learning.
The Allwither moves quickly. Already we can feel ourselves weakening, losing cohesion. The remaining shreds of our bindings have been corrupted and add to our pain.\n\nIf you set us free, we can pull energy from the uncorrupted grove and aid you.
I do. But it warms my heart to know she's getting a chance to see the world as your companion. I've known her for almost her whole life, you know. \n\nThe smile she wore the day she won the tourney was a rare treat.
Back when I arrived, the Amenos jailers used it as a training ground. It's a nice, isolated place to learn about subduing prisoners.\n\nSometime after they processed me and I was banished to the jungle, rumors started about a game on the island.
I don't know. It depends. Some prisoners undergo processing within days. Others get to remain in the stockade indefinitely, as a reward for some service or another. The jailers call them trusties.\n\nI'd use a different word.
Surely my reputation precedes me? The great captain of the famed Prowler?\n\nI kid. Sure, I may have sailed all across Tamriel. Delivered supplies that turned the tides of battle. Saved the lives of heroes! But, there's no reason you should know me.
Any smuggler worth their salt knows how to read them. They give simple directions or warnings. \n\nIf you're not taught properly, they only look like random scratches. Hiding in plain sight works well for that career.
Lord Bacaro believes, and I agree, that living alongside the enemy dulls hatreds. These soldiers share stories, heal together, eat at the same table.\n\nHopefully our hospice plants seeds that will someday bloom into peace.
If I'd killed them all then what would I do the next time I needed an adventure? No, you can't just kill every enemy you encounter. Oh dear, you should be glad you're not my squire, you'd have so much to learn.\n\nStill, more adventure for me!
We're not a religious organization, per se, but we do take inspiration from the teachings of Stendarr. We establish healing centers and other works to show compassion and mercy to those touched by this terrible war—soldiers and commoners both.
No, but we know how to take care of ourselves. And even if we didn't, there aren't many people keen to try and take on a Pahmar and a vampire. \n\nMost people give us a wide berth when we're together. You don't have to worry about us.
An excellent deduction! They also noticed that the Ascendant Magus and Lord spoke with the accents of Breton nobility. We believe a High Isle noble is funding this band of rogue knights.\n\nThen you recovered this map from Castle Navire.
Even if the archdruids told them to bow to this path-traitor's demands, I wouldn't. The circles live in harmony. Storming into this enclave and razing it to the ground? It's unthinkable!\n\nYou have to help me stop Archdruid Devyric.
Mate, you mean how will we learn that? Landing on this island bound our fates.\n\nWe'll scour this island for clues. Whatever raised that storm must be obvious. Keep whatever else you find as payment. Once satisfied, we can leave on this raft I made.
Kiv apparently sent some letters to Northpoint, pretending to work for Isobel's family. \n\nHe had some debts here, and was trying to use Veloise Mercantile funds to pay them off. Aurelia had all the details.
Quite correct! Marso and I were attacked! Isn't that a good sign? We're close to something here, I know it. \n\nI'm sure mother would rather I go rushing home. But I caused this problem. And I want to see it fixed.
I was carried to the healers, but they had to save their magic for the mortally wounded. So I got wooden braces and some bark to chew on that dulled the pain. My bones healed all wrong. Made walking constant agony.
Thank you. And, if I may … I also need to thank you for a more personal matter. My relationship with my daughter has gotten better … significantly better, as a result of her time spent with you.\n\nI hope you find her safe. Good luck, traveler.
An excellent answer! I must write that down.\n\nI expect that my notes will make an excellent basis for the next Investigator Vale novel. I must send them off to the author at once!
Excellent. Thanks to you I was able to rest, recover, and continue the search for my prey.\n\nUnfortunately, the Harrowstorms that plague the region shroud his presence. What comes next, we must do together.
Is that …? It is! A rare Dufort Red! My favorite! All right. Take this outfit. Wear it and the jailers will think you're a trusty and leave you alone. \n\nOh, but watch out for any jailers carrying a torch. They can spot a disguise in a sand storm!
Lord Bacaro worked diligently to bring the peace talks to High Isle. Not everyone thought that was a good idea. I'm curious as to who opposed him and why.\n\nBetter yet, he won't voice suspicions without good cause. We can rely on his discretion.
Aha, Arabelle. She's never failed me yet! Give her whatever help she requires.\n\nI haven't spoken to Ayrenn or Irnskar since the celebration. I think I actually miss them. The guards are overly protective of us, and we've had practically no contact.
I'm listening. What's on your mind?
<Placeholder. Will be replaced with RST 15793>
Each circle has many archdruids. I'm not sure how many the Firesong have. And they rarely leave their island. \n\nWe thought Archdruid Devyric was here to learn. But now he's going toward the Dais of Stonesight.
I'm a druid of the Stonelore Circle, from Galen. One of the islands in the Systres Archipelago. I've studied the Druid King all my life. I suppose you could call me an expert, but so much of our history was lost over the centuries.
I'm not actually sure they are. Dhulef just said he noticed them while he was conducting his investigation. The last time I ran into them those path-traitors attacked the Earthen Root Enclave and killed people I cared about. That won't happen again.
Earlier, I met with a Beldama wyress. Thought she might know something about why the Druid King visited the wyrds before leading the druids to the Systres. She needed time to recall the stories, but remembered this tablet and sent me to examine it.
A scent he has not detected in a long, long time. From one of his earliest missions as an Eye of the Queen. \n\nWe can talk more of this stench when not so many listen in, yes?
That would never work. It took untold hours of planning and preparation to get them here in the first place. And then we nearly lost them on multiple occasions.\n\nNo, this is our one chance for peace. We won't get another if they leave.
Raz mentioned another Eye, who fell tracking the bequest? A skilled agent named Roneiia. Raz always believed Grandvache was behind her death, but could not prove it.\n\nHer ciphered notes were never recovered. Grandvache must have finally cracked them.
Roneiia was one of the very first Eyes of the Queen.\n\nRaz only knew her for a few moons. She was a legend, an example for us all. Many of her missions are still kept secret to this day.
Ask for Philian Ashcroft, the proprietor. He knows me well and keeps a spot in Bayside Artisans here in town.\n\nAnd while Ryvana works on an antidote, I'll send Za'ji to make sure the alliance leaders don't accept any mysterious gifts.
And I assume the key we found will grant us access to this alchemical garden. Then I can craft an antidote for Lady Arabelle.\n\nShe and Lord Bacaro will know how to best handle this situation once she recovers from the poison.
That's strange. It makes me wonder what the Sea Elves really hope to gain by these attacks.\n\nLet's look around. Watch for anything that looks interesting or out of place. With any luck, we can figure out why the Sea Elves attacked Tuinh.
Let me see that. Could this be accurate? Could Lord Bacaro be a direct descendant of Druid King Kasorayn?\n\nOh no. The carvings. I think I know why this place is important to Lord Bacaro. Examine the carvings. I'll explain what I see in them.
My knights tracked a band of Dreadsails to the cave here at Suncleft Cove. As they tell it, however, a single Sea Elf tore through them before they could search inside. Didn't even bother to kill them. Just knocked them senseless and left them here.
It's a cavernous place where the voices of the roots can be heard. Some druids like to sit with the mushrooms and the pools of water and listen to the songs of the plants. \n\nI learned the darkness down there holds no comfort for me.
Hmm. Meet me at the Telling Stone, the landmark near the center of the island. It would be easier to simply show you the prophecy, and it's close to Draoife Dell.\n\nBesides, there's someone at the stone you should meet.
Not quite correct, I'm sorry.\n\nPerhaps you need to brush up on your Dragon knowledge, my friend.
That's … that's so unfair! I don't want to be a tree!\n\nWell, if only one of us can have our life back, I want you to choose Octin. He's too smart to let his mind turn to mush. Or light. Or whatever. Just don't tell him … I'm scared.
Bad timing. He arrived before I did, so he left me a letter and went on ahead. When he mentioned spotting the Firesong, I couldn't help but worry about him.\n\nNow that you're here, we can go to the meeting place and make sure Dhulef's all right.
I owe her more than just investigating the path of the Druid King, but she's my friend. She showed me that there was more to the world. More to me. \n\nAnd after what happened at the enclave … Firesong dogs! Them being here can't be a coincidence.
That's what I hired you for! To figure out these kinds of things.\n\nMaybe if you tried smashing it? Breaking stuff always fixes something, at least in my experience.
I suspected you'd like that dish. It's a local favorite! As for the others, I was hoping to include them. Ah, well. I'll find something better to replace them with.\n\nWhat about the fishing holes and scenic viewpoints? Are they all safe for tourists?
That's … disappointing. Still, better to know that now than find out when my customers complain about the quality of our supposedly excellent cuisine. I'll need to find a better chef. I know we have good food on the islands.\n\nWhat about the sites?
Mount Firesong rises above Y'ffelon, but its roots extend throughout the archipelago. It gives the islands their hot springs and steam vents. Usually these are curiosities, not particularly dangerous. But this recent activity is concerning.
No. Before they were … distant. Quiet. Whispers and dreams. Now that the seeds are together, they stir again. They are finding their voices. Remembering what they are. Calling out to me.
I heard. If we can get him to tell us how to contain the relic, we can sneak into the caves and grab it.\n\nGo get the silverbloom. I'll keep him talking. Talking with those wet, blue lips of his.
Interesting. I was informed that those crates were lost at sea, but I suspected there was more going on than a simple accident. Add to that the minor thefts and intruders my knights keep running off … it seems the Ascendant Order has targeted us.
Yes. Here, I shall mark your map with the location of his most recent feeding. I will meet you there.\n\nThank you, hunter. Know that when the Worm is ash, some small amount of my pain will be healed.
What? The enclave is gone? Those Firesong dogs and sons of dogs!\n\nPlease tell me—Laurel, how is she? Did they hurt her?
Ha, the sea would wash this island away before I could tell you my whole story. These days I'm a member of the Mages Guild.\n\nBefore that, most would call me a pirate. And I can't deny that it fairly describes my work back then.
Crocodiles, wolves, ursauks, among others. The animals in the path are usually docile. We feed them, care for them. Now they attack without provocation. For things to be so out of balance … it goes against my understanding of nature.
Will fire ever create instead of destroy? Will the tides ever change their rhythm? Mountains may flatten waiting for such a change. \n\nBut it's not impossible, my friend. Nothing ever is.
Understanding. I was summoned to quicken the seeds. Crown, staff, and gauntlet. But I do not know why King Kasorayn made them sleep. So how can I know when to wake them?\n\nWe should explore. Learn. I will follow you.
Za'ji and Caska are invited? Well, as expected, of course! After all Za'ji has done, it is only natural to want him there to observe. And to keep the queen and the others safe.\n\nBut Caska, too? Really? Oh very well. If Lady Arabelle insists.
Someone's got to defend the home port. Even a slime like Sealord Nalos knows that. They're more of the lowly scum who spit in the face of King Orgnum. \n\nThey'll put up a fight, though, same as the ones you faced in Castle Tonnere.
All chimera that roam the land today were created by the Druid King himself. They guard and protect sacred places or important relics.\n\nWhile we Stonelore revere them and their purpose, it's clear that the world is outgrowing them.
Do you have to ask it like that? I know I don't look good, but spare me an ounce of vanity, please. I don't know if I'll make it to the day's end!
He let me know that the herd was frightened of the wolves. I don't know if he caught a scent or if he heard the Fauns' call from far away.\n\nFauns are miraculous creatures. Did you know they have magic? I learn something new about them every day.
A nature spirit, called from the Green by King Kasorayn and hidden with the wyrd in High Rock. They slept since the time of the last Druid King until the Firesong Circle sent an archdruid to find Frii and awaken them.
Story unclear. Tell again. Druids of the path attacked. Killed. Chronicle shocked, angry. Spirit motes released. Cannot hold back the wind.\n\nCreated wraiths to defend the path. Lost control. Cannot stop. Sorry. So sorry.
There have been disagreements. Some of them violent. Firesong attacked Earthen Root, a Stonelore enclave. Claimed they were keeping a sacred seed from them. And some Eldertide on High Isle are causing trouble, working with the Ascendant Order.
Za'ji decided to … to … to wait out here for you, five-claw! Yes, yes, Za'ji waited to direct you. It is easy to get lost in such places, yes?\n\nLady Arabelle followed the Ascendant Lord—should Za'ji call him that now?
I probably know more about the Druid King than any other druid alive, but so much remains a mystery.\n\nThe Dream of Kasorayn describes a mountain shaking and a Sower awakening. I think it's talking about Mount Firesong and Frii.
The Mornards are neighbors, so to speak. Count Leonard sent word to me about Galen's troubles with the Sea Elves. I have many responsibilities on High Isle, but still … I had to help an old friend.
Well, just the one. That's why I'm so affordable. I want to make a name for myself in the trade and I need the work. Maybe my employers will tell House Mornard how talented I am.\n\nHopefully on my next job I'll remember to ask about volcanoes.
The Ascendant Order? The rogue knights that caused trouble on High Isle? I haven't seen any indication that those rebels are on Galen, but I'll make sure the druids and my knights remain vigilant.\n\nI assume this has to do with the peace talks?
I will remain, but I will be different. As the seed becomes a tree, I shall become the spirit of the mountain. And I will slumber, as will Mount Firesong.\n\nNow take the crown and the gauntlet and place them around me.
First and foremost, we want to practice safe food handling. So be sure you don't let that smoldering cut set you ablaze!\n\nSure, it's extra work to harvest from a creature born in magma. But I'm certain it's got a unique flavor that can't be beat!
Aye, Archdruid Orlaith made a bargain with Sealord Nalos. Promised him a stronghold on Galen. In return, he was to get the Eldertide Circle's sacred seed for her.\n\nAnd eliminate the Draoife.
I'm not sure what I think. I know Frii has no desire to wield power and wouldn't harm a fleshfly. Frii doesn't understand such impulses. They're not a child or a fool, but they are naive to the ways of the mortal world and could be easily misled.
What a relief. I can't bear to think of him trapped in such a state for all these years, suffering. I'm glad to know he's all right. \n\nI've heard stories of those who die upon the sea and remain in agony forever. Did he say anything else?
I hardly believe it myself. As Archdruid Orlaith was murdering Archdruid Rahval, suddenly the entire island began to shake. Then the cathedral shook apart, burying all the injured and innocents sheltering there under rubble—including Count Mornard.
Heh, a good jest, stranger. Next you'll tell me a Daedric Prince sits in the White-Gold Tower. No, my friend. As bitter as it is fighting our kin, this war will end only one way.\n\nWith Ranser on the throne and House Mornard properly elevated.
Because so many of our records have been lost. The druids were almost wiped out a number of times in our history. And the Druid King's sanctum in Ivyhame has been sealed since his death. No one has passed through that door in countless seasons.
Laurel says Frii is unsure what to do next. Their purpose revolved around the sacred seeds and restoring the Druid King's regalia. Now they're waiting for a new Draoife to be formed so that the druids can decide how to move forward.
Nothing like this. Isolated raids, some pillaging. They were pirates before, but now they act like a conquering army.\n\nWatch out for the one that knocked my knights senseless. She must be quite a fighter to defeat them without spilling any blood.
Yes, but we used to control so much more. My father was the Duke of the Systres. When he supported King Ranser in his war against the high king, Emeric took the ducal title and awarded it to House Dufort.\n\nAn unjust and harsh penalty, in my opinion.
The broker liked my drive, but not my lack of experience. So, he teamed me up with Umindior.\n\nI hope I don't let him down by losing my partner. That's bad for a reputation.
The Llanshara job got a bit … weird. I worried you might not partner with me again. Oh, I mean, on the job. Work together.\n\nNow I realize I should've asked you from the start.
Just that I learned the ways of the druids, as well as the ways of a knight and Breton noble. Too long have the druids and House Mornard sought the glory of the past. This is an opportunity to find a new path that combines the best of our legacies.
Frii isn't gone, they just found a new purpose. And by their actions, they calmed the volcano and saved us all. I'll go to Y'ffelon, try to commune with Frii. Sometimes bound spirits respond, sometimes not. But they'll know I remember. That I care.

Aren't you fighting Elves, though?
If you insist.
She tried to kill us. She was a follower of Molag Bal. I slew her and destroyed the Vivicus.
Who is <<c:1>>, again?
Why do you need me?
What do I get out of this again?
How can I prove myself?
Yes. I'll find the switch.
I'm ready to fight.
Kill the prisoners. The skin-stealer fights without aid.
I proved that I'm the better combatant.
What did he say?
Is there anything I can do?
What's a lich?
Yes. I will join the tribe.
Maybe they haven't been turned.
What do you know about the Wilderking?

Do you remember me?
Are you a soldier?
Is there any way to find out if I am the Moon Hallowed?

What? How?
He's trying to find the Amulet of Kings before we do.
Isn't the Shivering Isles in Oblivion?
Laniriel's pregnant. She asked me to tell you.
They let you join?
[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight.
Can you tell me more about the relics I'm looking for?
I'll get you out. Are any of the other guards still alive?
But a Goblin?
Raz and I just fought together at Senalana.
Then let's get moving.
Where are the crocodiles?
What's the next step?
Why would Casnar change his mind?
Who is Uncle Thahk?
How are you going to find them?
Maybe I should just speak to them myself.
Yes. She said you were hurt?
I'll get the relics out of here.
Sure, send <<1>> to recover <<Az:2>>.
I understand.
We'll speak after I deal with this.
That's a risk I'll just have to take.
Not once?
What happened to your husband?
I don't think so. They took him, too.
That's not important right now. Drink this and run for the bridge. You'll be safe there.
What do you know about Ifriz?
I'm not. He'll be here shortly.
The Belle of Balfiera.
What's so important about your sword?
<Try Again.>
Where is Pircalmo?

Why would the Withered Hand attack this place?
Is the sword powerful?
Why are you here?
What do you mean?
What will you do now?
Why does having the two souls weaken you so badly?
Accompany me on the initial assault.
The Shadow Walkers are with us?
Get going then.
I'll meet you at Hectahame.
Are you taking the other prisoners with you?
Who is Meratille?
Who is Ulmion?
You can go, but don't ever come back.
You should get to safety. Head to <<1>>.
Where do I find the relics?
What are the Dro-m'Athra?
Which army was that?
I'll find her, Shazah.
You cannot violate the Green Pact. This is wrong.
You don't agree with being here?
What do you want me to do?
How goes the battle?
Thank you, soldier. Good work.
How do I find the hostages?
I can't just take the circlet and do something terrible with it?
Did you learn what the Sea Vipers plan for <<1>>?
You should get to safety.
What's worse than a hurricane?
I'm trying to help him out. Can I have that piece of quartz?
I'll get the meat pies and be right back.
Can you elaborate on those patrols?

What about the other missions?
How can you stop the harpies?
What have the Sea Vipers done?
So repair the shrines and we get into the sanctum.
You seemed to know Molag Grunda. Does it bother you that we had to kill her?
And what does the Great Shackle do?
I'll do what I think is right.
What is it you want?
Is there any way I can convince you to let these two go?
What will you do now?
And you say you're stuck?
So you're just waiting while it's fixed?
Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?
What do you mean by that?
What's that?
How do we capture the enemy's Elder Scrolls?
Who's behind this?
I'll untie you and then be on my way.
But won't they die as well when we destroy the planar vortex?
This letter proves he's sent travelers to be ambushed by bandits.
Perhaps.
I just need one heartwood fragment.
Who is Valaste, again?
What happened to the others?
I'll be right behind you.
I'll take them all. Otherwise, I'll just keep killing you and disrupting your game.
What then?
How do we capture an Elder Scroll held by the enemy?
I don't believe so.
Hjorik seems to think you'll recover.
Ring of Daggers?
I'd like to hear about Scouting missions.

Pellingare deserves death. I will look the other way.
The Path?
Who are these charlatans?
I think she wants you to have her sword.
What does she teach?
Tell me about Nirnroot wine.
Which way are we heading?

Where can I find this Claw?
What about Abnur Tharn and Mannimarco?
Where can I find Tharlas and Jonne?
What's the reward?
I've made up my mind. Don't worry, you'll make a fine king.
There's a war to win. I intend to take up the fight in Cyrodiil.
What about you?
I'm ready to join up.
Why?
The Reachmen are no longer a threat. The Imperials are the greatest danger now.
I'll look for Imiril.
He came here to stand with his family against invaders. Is it justice you seek, or vengeance?
So? What am I supposed to do?
What about the village's oath to the Wilderking?
This will be dangerous, right?
How did you come to be here?
They pulled the idea from Sai's head, didn't they?
Do you know where the ruin is?
It's time to take the offensive against Molag Bal.
It wanted to seal you away.
Apparently you were wrong.
<<1>> returned to <<2>>. You could go there.
Then we must find him, and quickly.
Why is Molag Bal keeping you here?
What happens to the Mages Guild if we fail?
What happens to the Mages Guild if we fail?
We can't fail.
Is there no other way?
And what's your role in all of this?
Those were bandits. This woman did nothing to you.
I need to get you out of here.
How do you know this?
If you're sure, then. I'll make for Claw's Strike.
How will I recognize the constable?
I'll be here to support you, Your Majesty.
And the spell remains intact?
Won't you care if I imprison you in <<Az:1>>?
She blames herself for your death.
Let's go.
How so?
Is there anything more I can do?
Will you be able to make it through this, Sai?
So where is this place?
What's going on here?
What can you tell me about the Falinesti Faithful?
Do you know where <<1>> went?
She said it's a secret only a crow would know.
Thank you for the information.
How did you two hear about this village?
Thank you for the information.
How did the witchmen succeed?
Have you found anyone to help yet?
So you act as bookhunters?
I wish to join the Mages Guild, then.
Is there reason to believe he isn't?
Such as?

Thank you.
What can you tell me about Murcien's Hamlet?
We'll figure it out.
Isabeth? Do you know where they went?
I'll go speak with her.
I am?
Was Montclair always this ambitious?
Jode's Chariot?
You mentioned it was planted inside of her?
Your home was destroyed. Where will you go now?
How can I tell who is really needy?
Where will the parley take place?
What can I do?
<Give him a package of <<1>>.>
And in the graveyard itself?
Daedric Anchors?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry your friend betrayed you.
She wanted this alliance. It will save Evermore.
Where can I find the <<1>>?
We never learned why the Ayleids hid this relic within this desolate tower.
You mentioned that before. What mistake did we make?
Something like that.
So how do we destroy the Anchor?
Let's go find Gwendis and the others.
You don't seem concerned about <<1>>.
That's not going to happen.
Let's take that last step.
What's the plan if we find her?
I defeated <<1>>. Surrender, or I'll show you exactly how I did it.
Why would you say he's finished with your partnership?
In his journal, he said he was happy because he could provide for you.
What about the Hollow Moon?
Place "Mastery of Sacrifice"
Place "Mastery of Sacrifice"
Will you be leading the assault?
Is it safe? <<1>> drove <<2>> mad.
What does the message say?
<<1>> turned you into a statue.
These statues are Ayleids?
It's time to go, Gwendis.
Let's move out.
Where is it now?
Nobody suspected the fire was deliberate?
Why did you come here?
What dangerous secret is that?
So why didn't you leave?
Do you think Montclair seriously wants to start a war?
How long have you been waiting?
Put on the ring. I'll lead you to your father.
Is there a reason he's torturing you?
I need a new challenge. Any recommendations?
He wants me to enter the tomb.
Where can the Undaunted prove themselves in Coldharbour?
What about flaming oil?
Are you trying to start a fight with me?
Tell me about the one in the Daggerfall Covenant.

I want to help the village.
That might anger the Voice of the Forest.

What is known about the battle that happened here?
Why was the camp caught unawares?
Who can operate <<c:1>>?
Who can operate <<c:1>>?
Your Argonian found it, not me.
Do you have the relic?

All right. That seems reasonable.
What if she promised to marry you?
Have you found a way to get inside yet?
Have you learned anything since you've been out here?
What crimes did you commit during the war?
How do we stop Baron Montclair?
What do you think happened?
Ask me your next riddle.
Your beloved, that would be Arlie?
And how do we do that?
It does look like the people are expecting that.
<Put the bottle away.>
Will do, Guildmaster.
The people of the Alik'r desert won't fight undead?
What do you need me to do?
I want to know more about the star signs.
Did your crew disagree?
"Eyes of Akatosh!"
I promised him I'd find the mace. Any idea where I should look?
Aren't you worried about their dead coming back to life?
<Add a gear.>
Where did the spirits come from?
You said these spirits are Chimer?
I'll see this done, then.
Thank you.
So you act as bookhunters?
What would I get in return?
You don't talk like a typical Bosmer.
All right.
What changed?
Is the alchemist making any progress?
I wish to join the Mages Guild, then.
It's up to me, then. I'll cleanse the shrines.
Erunor said you would tell me more about your village.
I should add the dragon scale mushrooms now.

How do I use the lightning prod?
What's unclear?
How is any of this good news?
That's surprisingly good.
Sure, why not?
It's sweet, but not too sweet.
Thank you for sharing this.
Alga leads the Vosh Rakh, but they're going to blame Solgra for everything that's happening.
I can't just leave, not while there are still things that need to be done.
There must be another way.
I don't know.
Tell me more about the potion.
We talked about the tunnels before she died.
Open the portal.
Do the Winterborn have equal claim to the <<1>>?
All right. Where should I look?

How poorly?
Thanks for the help.

You're rather cynical.

This might be more dangerous than you think.
The Thieves Guild never dealt with skooma or slaves?
Are you certain you've never heard of "<<1>>?"
So how do we find this missing piece of the puzzle?
Don't blame <<1>>. It was my choice to infiltrate the Iron Wheel's headquarters.
What do you think about Quen?
Did you forgive her?
Good luck, <<1>>.
Anything else?
It's a chant. Descriptions of people, like riddles, ending with "you will know them by their eye."
Understood. I'll give it a try.
How did you get drawn into the Grand Chanter's cult?
You have access to all the guild's finances?
What do you mean, emotional?

By "reject" do you mean "kill?"
Grahtwood is my destination.
Stormhaven is my destination
A city in the Dominion.
Stormhaven is my destination
So how do I use it to counteract Sunna'rah?
I need her help. It's going to take two of us to operate Barilzar's tonal inverter.
I'll plant Sunna'rah in the floor and return Vivec's power to him.

Can you tell me anything else about the siblings?
You let her join the Morag Tong?
Tell me more.
Why do you think Azura decided to help us?

And the Clockwork City? Did he talk about that?
Are there other uses for the fibers?
Can you tell me more about Slag Town?
Why is the Wellspring different?
I think I'll just use Snuffler.

Gascone promised to deliver a key to Clavicus Vile, but crows stole it before he had the chance.
You seem young for such an important role.
My friend may die if you don't help me. You want that on your conscience?
All right. Thank you.
So you want me to operate the controls in secret?
I'll think about it.
That does sound frustrating, but ….
Seems like Chancellor Gascone has worries of his own.
Now can you help us?
The Vale of Tiers is dangerous. Let me help you.
You should visit the Asylum Sanctorium, just to be sure.
After you finish your explorations, how do you plan to get back to Morrowind?

Her condition seems pretty grave. I'm not sure if she'll survive.
What will you do now?
So Emile would sacrifice himself to protect Haladan's memory?
The triad's attacking your realm?
So we're not in Tamriel?

So it happened during a battle?
What kind of beast attacked you?
What challenge might that be?

So, the Illuminus is your story?
What do you mean?
Do you mind if I look around for one anyway?
Fine. Get out of here before I change my mind.
I'll make sure to relay the message.
Actually, she gave me this tea. Is this an acceptable trade?
Darien and I will scout ahead.
Are you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me?
They didn't really leave us a choice.
So we can use this altar to open a portal to the Gorge?
I thought you said she was your apprentice.
Why are you trying to make a record of the battles that occurred here?
What happens to Lotus now?
Why would she throw us out in the middle of a crisis?
What do you mean?
All right, let's give it a try.
You said it will be harder to access the Crystal Tower now?
Do you plan on drinking innocent people's blood?
I'm sorry.
The Isle of Balfiera?
No. I made a deal with Renzir, and I'm going to honor that.
What did you mean by darker forces?
If you'll excuse me, Aldarch Tilcalar, I just remembered I have someplace else to be.
You don't find that suspicious?
Can you tell me more about the temple?
Geysers? I don't understand.
All right, open the gate.
Thanks for giving us a fighting chance.
All right. Who am I looking for?
Was the Dragon War when you slew Thurvokun?
Were you in command of the keep before it fell into the hands of the Maormer?
You're welcome. I'll accompany you.
If I'm going to serve as your admanen, I need to know everything.
All right. I'm right behind you.
What happened to your daughter?
We should keep looking.
Soravil.
Aren't you worried about the Divine Prosecution?
And then?
You hope not?
Stay close.
All right, I'm in.
I'll try.
What are you looking for down here?
You did intend to tamper with Vinafwe's botanical arrangements though.
How can the Crystal Tower exist on multiple planes at the same time?
Actually, I have pewter ounces. What's next?
What about Lotus and Talomar?
What can you tell me about Traitor's Vault?
Why hasn't the Psijic Order cleaned it out?
Fair enough. What are you drinking?
What are you hunting?
All right. How will I know where the books go?
Isn't that a bit much?
Tell me about the spell you're performing.
Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sload?
Why would Nocturnal betray the triad and take the Heart?
Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sload?
Where did you send Valsirenn and Oriandra?
How do we get to the Sapiarchs' compound?
What was her role in all this?
Who are you, exactly?
What about Hyircil?
Why's that?
You mentioned foreign magic before. What did that have to do with believing Silurie?
So you're more troubled by this happening in your homeland?
It's all right.
You think you'll find a way to keep the pieces apart?
So you let the Maormer into Sea Keep.
Good. I'll take the Augur to her now.
So Leythen left Artaeum?
Are you done?
Who is this Ghost of the Green?
I'll find the stone.
What happened?
How did you wind up in service to Nocturnal?
How did you wind up in service to Nocturnal?
Your father's never talked about his past?
Why would she hate the sea?
Nocturnal created a shadow Sotha Sil to usurp his throne. I freed the real Seht and foiled her plan.
What's your relationship to Mehdze?
You're more than just a keeper here, aren't you?
There's a mechanism under a candelabra on the second floor. See for yourself.
You think the ruins are the source of the disappearances?
What do the Sapiarchs have to do with the Crystal Tower?
And who is the Proxy Queen?
If you needed help on this, why not bring Oriandra?
Tell me more about the Sapiarchs.
You said it will be harder to access the Crystal Tower now?
Speaking of companions, you seem to have picked one up.
Anything in particular I should watch out for?
You think they may attack us?
Save your father. Do what you feel is right.
I'll get you the wamasu egg.
I was hoping Eshundir could tell me about these Argonian antiquities.
So you'll be joining the bonding ritual?
What do you need? Maybe I can find it for you.
Does it say where the Remnant is?
Let me give you some money, then.
What does an ancient sorcerer have to do with all this?
Why do you want this crystal?
I will. Farewell!
What is its function?
What can I do to help?
I'll meet you inside.
All right, I'll search the depot for more clues.
Right. I found spy reports. Many of them are addressed to a group called the Blackguards.
We'll find them. Xukas thinks we might be able to get more information from the Dead-Water tribe.
How so?
Why do you think Tsofeer Cavern holds the answers you seek?
I have to think about this.
You're right. She's proven too dangerous. Do what you have to do. [Hostia dies]
I'll help you prove Bhoki's techniques.
How will I know them?
Her notes mentioned other matured hatchlings being sequestered. I don't think these are them.
Why would Margus Derius want to destroy Murkmire?
Who are the Black-Tongues?
So these suitors are marrying into your tribe?
If you're safe here, why do you need my help?
She chose to stay behind so she could guide the tribe back to the Hist. She was happy.
The tree-minder believes there's something wrong with the eggs. They're suffering.
All right. Famia and I will end this.
The Wasseek-Haleel? Who are they?
What can you tell me about the Blackguards?
Varo asked me to recover some tablets from the Teeth of Sithis.
And he made a deal with you.
What can you tell me about Blackrose Prison?
Why were you a Blackguard?
Does your tribe usually seek help from outsiders?
What's the plan?
Sounds dangerous. Think you can help somehow?
What did you experience in your dream-wallow?
Haxara, these can't be your children. They look almost fully grown.
That doesn't change the fact that I'm not a member of the tribe.
Good luck, Kishi.
I was told you found one of the Skin Taker's victims.
How was his grave-stake stolen?
Is that how you became injured?
Tell me about the necromancer, Baxilt-Gah.
What are your thoughts on the matter?
Thanks for the information. We should get going.
What about now? Can you become the tree-minder of this Hist?
Xukas told me the two of you are friends.
I'll take the renewal charm to Lady Laurent.
Days of Stone-Nests?
Tell me about the other frogs.
Why are you so worried about this particular tree?
And why is that important?
There must be something you can tell me about it.
What do you expect me to find?
Meaning …?
How'd he die?
So, she made a poor deal.
Ojel? What's that?
All right. So, back to the deal with Domitia. It went bad?
Hostia? The slaver I spared from execution?
Did he win?
It might not be that simple.
How can you be so sure about this?
You think you can kill them all?
How can we set them free?
Is that why you're here? To admire me.
You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk.
No, but I still like order.
What's your point?
Safe travels.
Do you think that will go over well?
Who's Euraxia?
Is there really a way to stop the Dragons?
You think hunters will help you bring animals back to the Prowl?
I'll find Zumog Phoom's lair in the Scar and meet you there.
How do I do that?
What was that about Dragon imagery?
How does that prove my strength?
Stop him? What's the Betrayer planning to do?
How did you solve it?
That's what you came here for? What is it?
So you believe that spirit is one of Magnate Feina-Darak's ancestors?
You're behind the madness at the temple, aren't you?
Let's get going then.
If that means you're in, we're meeting in the Bowel.
How do we regroup?
All right, I'll see if I can find out where she disappeared to.
Dog means death? Really?
So why ask me for my help?
Your mother mentioned a rival, M'zum, might be invovled.
Moving on. You seem pretty confident. Why do you need my help?
Do you have him under control now?
What are the Halls of Colossus?
Who did you just kill?
I can track down the source of the necromantic power.
So you expect us to surrender?
And then?
He said that he's your father.
All right.
You blamed yourself for what happened to the royal family. So why did you decide to return?
Why did you dig up Cadwell's head?
The Grand Adept and Zamarak should be heading out as well.
I haven't found them yet.
Who is Rajhin?
So, you're an adept? How'd you end up in a place like this?
You're trying to become a bard?
Like what?
All right, I'll head to Vek-Drassi.
You were a holy man?
When did your Moon-Bishop start having visions?
What are the Sands Behind the Stars?
What's the story behind the Skooma Cat?
Tell me more about Dragonhorn Tower.
Why would the Euraxians arrest one of their own officers?
The eclipse? I don't understand.
Why do you want this Marzula-jo's notes?
Different aspects? What do you mean?
Will you accept this gold for Fez'skar or not?
You think finding him will be a challenge?
I'll go find Abnur Tharn.
Tell me more about the Moonlight Blade.
You mentioned the Sands Behind the Stars before. What is that?
And you sent for me to help you against the Dragons.
Another matter?
How much was the fee?
Well, Asaldak is on his way. I'll search for the Screaming Mammoths in Valenwood Gate next.
Why did Alkosh come here?
Rigurt needs you to play for Lady Izza to gain her favor.
Baandari?
Did Alkosh unleash Dragons on Elsweyr?
You said he's the Dragon King of Cats? What's that mean?
They ate too much moon-sugar, and want us to play in their place.
Was that really the ghost of Euraxia Tharn?
Little lattice?
How did the Dragon convince you he was Alkosh?
There must be something you'll like.
And did you also dispatch the ogrim I found at one of the sites?
What did he do?
Who did he choose?
Zalsheem, the dro-m'Athra.
Fine. So, you couldn't beat the location of the jewel out of Fez'skar?
You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr.
You're saying I should ask your friends about the kind of Khajiit they are?
Are you afraid there will be another Dragon attack?
You look fine, don't worry.
Can I ride you?
Remind me, why is Euraxia no longer a problem?
Cadwell, stay with me.
So you became vampires?
What skills do you bring to this situation?
It seems the bell might be irreplaceable.
Does the origin of the Dragonhorn matter?
Good luck, General Renmus.
My companion and I will join the Order of the New Moon.
All right, I'm ready to destroy the aeonstone.
I'll check on your brother, but I need some answers.
How so?
Tell me more about the situation in Senchal.
But you left the abbey to search for the Dragonguard tombs.
She hired a Khajiit to deliver a token, but she thinks he decided to get drunk instead.
All right, I'm interested in the job.
So … I guess you'll be needing these clothes.
We're on a mission to investigate the Order of the New Moon. Think you can help?
More resistance? What do you mean?
Why is that?
How did you end up in Senchal?
Well, here's your … cat.
So now they're ready to fight Dragons?
Meridian nonsense?
So Ra'khajin is a Dragon Priest for Laatvulon.
What did you have in mind?
I need to get the mask before Ra'khajin does.
You're probably right. Let's see if we can find him.
Turning stones and looking for what?
How does it kill people?
Connected how?
Are you sure you want to go after the smuggler heading to Senchal?
So, you like Zhasim, too?
Couldn't you have spent your gold on restoring the city itself?
What did you do in Rimmen and Rawl'kha?
So why the change of heart?
Wasn't the Potentate assassinated?
Where was it?
What happened next?
The blood of a flightless bird, petals blue as the sky, and the skin of Khenarthi's fallen children.
Petals, blue as the sky.
Right. Then Tharn removed the island's defenses and sent me back to the surface.
I'll do all I can.
And do you think they're qualified to hunt Dragons?
All right, I'll use the grappling bow to reach the alcove and search for the key.
Your mother is heartbroken. She's worried that you're hurt, possibly dead.
Then let's go to the meeting place.
What was Kaalgrontiid really trying to accomplish?
What will the ritual tell us?
Should?
Dragons eat horses?
Important business? And what friend?
Will you stop her?
Any idea where we're going to find the ritual site?
All right. Let's head into Karthwatch.
What relic?
I'll try to find this Edjar then.
I can search for the survivors with you.
Svana wants to do this. No one is forcing her.
You said they stole a lantern of some kind?
We took a sample of refined netherroot brew from the midland camp. Lyris is bringing it to Solitude.
The high king won't listen to us. He thinks this is all some plot of the Skald-King.
Since the assassin escaped, they're probably expecting us.
What are you going to do now, King Jorunn?
Tell me more about this coven of witches. You mentioned pushing them into the sea?
Where did it come from?
What did your ancestor do to deserve a traitor's burial?
You think those men were trying to hide where they came from?
Should we investigate the mining town?
What do you need me to do?
Why are you recruiting for your debtors?
What kind of oddities?
I'll read Fennorian's message.
Fair enough. I'll talk to Mazog.
I saw you arguing with this vampire. He healed you?
Other than the assassin was a vampire who wore an eye patch and escaped? No.
Fair enough. Do you have any guesses about what might lie ahead?
Why are you here with the Jarl of Whiterun?
<Face Trial in Kyne's Aegis.>
I visited Elsweyr and battled a rage of Dragons … <Tell Kireth about your adventures.>
So, has Fennorian changed your view of vampires?
<Add Snow Bear Bile.>
<Add Snow Bear Bile.>
I'll take my reward either way.
What does that medallion do?
Are there any clues I should look out for?
Have you ever seen anything like the strange pike before?
I'll speak with Fenn.
Still, this is far from your holdings.
How did you escape?
What exactly is the Scraps?
How are you going to seal the temple?
All right, I'll meet you at Sabre Cat's Leap.
How do you know the Pale Man killed Bear?
I'll help you. What do you need me to get?
What were you supposed to tell Fenn, once your pack was freed?
Can you tell me more about the Khajiit?
How do we know the smugglers and Reachmen are even connected?
Not like here?
Explain what this is all about again.
I'll go after Rasir.
I'm a vampire, too. Do you want me to stay away?
<Combine three parts gloomspore agaric with one part bloodknight brain and consume the results.>
Lyris is in Solitude. I thought you tried to avoid large cities?
On the shores of an open sea, hordes of horkers frolic free.
So why are we here?
Are you sure this will work?
What will you do about those creatures still stalking the mine?
Tell me more.
If this is just an illusion, why can't you move?
Let's go.
Should I stuff you in my pack now?
I'll find Rasir.
What do we know about the midlands camp?
Sounds like the garrison is in trouble.
You came to Kilkreath by yourself?
Tell me about yourself.
I'll bring you the organs to find out.
Who are you again?
Tell me more about Kyne's Aegis.
What sounds?
The note says the pentarch was pulled through the portals by one of these shards.
Is this related to what we learned in Western Skyrim?
I'll meet you by the cart.
What do you know about Nighthollow Keep?
All I suggest is that we live in peace with mortals. They outnumber us, after all.
Any idea what this place might have been?
I'll find Arana and we'll deal with Lady Belain.
You make it sound like no one else has used this place in a long time.
Tell me more about your sister.
Verandis said we might not come back from this.
So Ard Caddach wants you to find her?
Why did you trick me into murdering Boss Trenlor?
Let me know if the Ravenwatch needs my assistance again.
You said you'd tell me about you and Adusa after you fed.
All right, let's go.
I'll find your missing scholars and the Pyre Watch warrior.
Tell me more about what you learned.
The shade made it sound as though the Dark Heart is alive.
Where will you be?
Let's move forward.
Who's Sai Sahan?
Perfection is impossible to attain.
Do you think Red Eagle was a Redguard swordmaster, too?
Remind me about the Direnni Elf.
What do you have planned for the Reach?
So Talfyg approached you due to House Ravenwatch's reputation?
What's tonal energy?
Is getting a response rare?
What do you want to do?
We'll investigate this cave.
What do you mean?
Who do you think the True-Sworn work for?
What do you think of Gwendis and Fennorian.
All right, where can I find them?
I didn't imagine you as the type to take a vacation.
I don't understand how a Reach hero could teach a Redguard swordmaster anything.
Icereach witches?
Have you decided to join the Ravenwatch?
Where was the relic kept before you took it?
If you suspected she was working with the Gray Host, why allow her to remain in your court?
And none of them have returned yet?
Have you been to Markarth before?
And what about Kathad?
I'll meet each of them at the appointed place.
A vested interest?
What do you plan to do while we're gone?
But you must have encountered something like it in all your travels.
Any idea what this place might have been?
I'll speak with him.
Thank you, captain.
Why would Rada al-Saran allow Lady Belain to lead his army?
How well did you know Councilor Jirich?
What brings you to Skyrim?
Are you lost?
Seeks? Who's that?
You think a treasure like that was left here?
Who was Gavos Douar?
If they successfully overthrew Gavos, why did this place sink into ruin?
You might want to turn around.
We have to find them first.
Where is the entrance to the ruin?
How'd you wind up falling into the ruins anyway?
Wait. Who are these people? Why did they take you prisoner?
This event sounds like Vandacia plans to reveal something special to his followers.
Treachery?
But you believe your mentor can teach them to control their powers?
What do you mean when you say Calia's power will consume her?
What about Tenarei Vels?
Isn't Revus your teacher? Why are you talking about him like this?
I want to see this through. I'll talk to the courier.
I don't trust you. You'd better stay there for now.
Here you go. And our coin, too. Eveli here will be accompanying me.
What kind of dreams?
All right, let's go see what's waiting for us in the Imperial sewers.
All right, I'll go to the cottage and speak with your son, Mathen.
Tell me about the dreams.
No remains?
I'd like to ask you about what happened before Igmund's death.
I have some other questions, if you're willing to share more.
What happened?
What's my motivation again?
The Argonian?
To find rare artifacts.
These people seem devastated by being woken from their dreams.
Where can we find this contact of yours?
Here. We found this ring alongside the scroll.
Do you often take jobs from people you never meet?
How do I shatter the ward?
Help is coming.
She seems to yearn for adventure, too.
You said Phalevon had a really sharp sword?
Did this Quistley run away from home?
What sort of revels would he and his new friends find in a cave?
I would hope so.
Why do the activities of a Mehrunes Dagon cult concern you?
He seemed to have a good sense of humor about it.
She laughed about it.
And the others?
You're lucky to be leaving this place alive, whoever claims you.
Calia almost burned down the temple. But Sombren knows someone who can help her.
You mentioned Goblins and Minotaurs?
I'll get the kit and find <<1>>.
Why did some of you stay behind?
Are you all right?
Thank you, Elossi.
Revus told us to investigate.
Can you let me out?
That journal that led you here. Did it happen to mention anything about the fate of the world?
You must have some idea what it is to have such a strong reaction.
Can you describe the Daedra, Shyazzel?
What do you know of Black Drake Villa?
How is your tribe connected to the xanmeer?
What happened?
Three? But Meer-Ta isn't here.
Your grandmother disappeared?
I spoke with the spirits of your apprentices. They showed me how to close the gate.
Where is this ring?
Another realm?
I'll help find Councilor Jirich.
I'll go with you to Bloodrun Cave to investigate the sanctuary.
Do we know an expert?
Did your family keep slaves?
Edvilda planned to send Irenni to the Inner Sea Armature, which is full of bandits.
What would you have been patrolling for?
What's the Black Fin Legion?
Where is Melyn Drad?
Is this some kind of planemeld? It feels like we're in Oblivion.
All right, we'll try to enter the vault and see what it contains.
I'll help you with your rescue.
What do you know about the ones who tried to take you captive?
Can you share a line from one of your poems?
In all that time, you never heard anything about the Ambitions?
The second worst?
Well, you did it, Eveli. You discovered the truth behind Leovic's secret.
Calm down and listen. The Dark Brotherhood didn't do this. They don't kill without a contract.
Can you undo the transformation?
Assist you how?
<Enter the Dread Cellar.>
But why can't you just remove the ward and open the door yourself?
Where are you headed next?
Why choose me?
Are you working with the Impresario?
And what do we do with these slivers once we find them?
You mentioned cult scouts. What happened to them?
How have you been since I visited the House of Reveries?
Tell me more about Lyranth the Dremora.
Let's talk about something else.
That leaves me and the Anchorite. What do you need us to do exactly?
What do you mean, desperate?
What do you make of Sister Celdina's testament?
How did you become Lyranth's prophet?
Hop in my pack, Arox.
Why do you think Arox knows about Ardent Hope?
If your sister never came home, how do you know she's here?
What's your coven's interest in the Crowborne Horror?
Good luck? Where are you going?
What kind of ward?
Won't Valkynaz Nokvroz resume command when he eventually returns?
Is this related to Leovic's secret and the Four Ambitions?
Does that price bother you?
And they brought you here?
What are they trying to accomplish?
Eveli and I can handle things.
Do you have someone in mind?
She didn't really say.
Where are we meeting in Leyawiin?
Tell me more about fluster fume root.
Can you help her remember everything she's forgotten?
I'm listening.
Thank you, Elegian. We'll take care of the cataclyst.
Do all Mantikora produce this venom?
Hop into the pack, Arox.
You seemed pretty angry when the Anchorite decided to go with Sombren and Calia.
How did you escape Destruction's Solace?
What do you plan to do now?
There's more.
You mentioned other groups. Who are they?
And what kind of Daedra are you, Madam Whim?
I'll pay.
How do you know so much about it? You're not a scholar or mage.
The cataclyst threatens Fargrave and Nirn. Shouldn't I destroy it?
What else can you tell me about the ritual?
So you're definitely going back to Mournhold?
Why do you think the Hexos vault is in the warehouse you mentioned?
Who are you?
Where can we get one?
Have they ever stolen something like this before?
How will you resolve the argument?
A corpse is not worthy compensation.
How can Shiro-dar help us find Master Rrvenk?
How did the attack start?
That seems like a big job.
Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil.
I thought Dremora can't die.
You seemed concerned that the Ravener spoke. What does it matter?
How do you make baked apples?
Is that sort of weather common here?
Where did the knights take the other salvagers?
Where did the Ascendant Order take Jakarn's friend?
Do you know where Jakarn was going first?
All right. I'm willing to help.
What kind of resistance do you think we'll run into?
Tell me about your partner.
Is he going to be all right?
Is our trial a poem?
You said the reward was freedom?
fl2
What's the favor?
They have a death spell on them. It killed Delric, but Valessea made this powder to dispel it.
Why would anyone want to keep the war going?
Why are House Mornard and House Dufort at odds?
Right. The Ascendant Lord told the Magus to assemble the Order on High Isle.
I'll gather the flowers and a torchbug.
What do you think happened to the knight who received this summons?
What do you want me to do?
Mender Roslenn wants you to confront Master Healer Viralaine with us.
Will you be all right?
Truth doesn't hide under a helm. Who are you?
Your music scared off the Hadolids?
I'll return the blessed awl to you.
So you take care of more than just Privette?
There's no law and order on Amenos?
What's the Society of the Steadfast?
Tell me more about House Dufort.
But what if the Telvanni assume you are a slave, with me?
Why would prisoners want the mine's protection?
What are you and Daluion doing here?
How did you find out Kiv was the thief?
You know Isobel and Aurelia, then?
What does that have to do with the map fragments?
What happened to Caska?
A friend of ours may be on that ship with him, and her family is worried about her.
The prisoners have free run of the jungle?
Let's go, then.
And what about the treasure?
I'll get the scoria from that pile.
How do the medallions work?
How has the investigation gone?
At least Aurelia and her mother are getting along better.
How are you going to get your friend out of this promise?
Why are you glad she's in fighting form?
You know they lost control of their storm ritual?
Can't we just take the Silver Swan or one of the other ships at the Navire Docks?
That's the purpose of the conference, right?
Are the prisoners transported to Amenos treated badly?
What exactly is a druid?
I helped a woman named Lashgikh swear vengeance on the murderers that killed her husband.
What sort of information?
I was sad not to see you on Summerset.
And the lodestone?
Za'ji and I found some lodestones like this in a Sea Elf encampment.
Where did the Hadolids come from?
All right. Thanks.
What do you think happened?
Then let's make it right by saving Jhaka now.
You think Zenithar's worshippers would hunt you?
Any other threats I should be aware of?
What happened to these pirates?
Why did you think the Hadolids would be friendly?
Need me to find the other map fragments?
I'm sorry that happened to you, Jhaka.
Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)
What brings you to High Isle?
Will that allow me to challenge Tribute players in the higher ranks?
And the two druids we spoke to? What do you think about the information they provided?
Perhaps we'll see each other again someday, Sir Rayan.
What's so special about this drink you're making?
You left the pirates alive?
You found a sea of pirates?
You don't trust me, Mel?
Did you run into any trouble while tailing us?
Outsmarted himself? How?
Do you plan to go forward with the peace talks?
I'd like to know more about the Trials of Worth.
Got it, avoid the jailers carrying torches.
What's so special about these particular ships?
Is there anything else I should know about?
Let's talk about something else.
You're a historian?
Why are you so interested in the Druid King specifically?
And what does the tablet tell us?
So you feel you can complete your survey of the caves now?
I'll figure out who sent the poison, Lady Arabelle.
The Firesong attacked Earthen Root Enclave and tried to capture Frii in Glenmoril.
And the druid circles would accept him as their king?
Where did Sealord Nalos go?
It could be the Ascendant Order. They recently stole armor from the society.
What's so important about tracing the path of the Druid King?
I'll try to rescue all of them—Druid Niraya, the sacred seed, and Sir Stefan.
Do people usually behave like Neri toward you?
I don't know for certain.
What about the Ascendant Order? They control the Dufort Shipyards.
Do you hate Dragons?
Sounds like you're proud to serve House Mornard.
When Archdruid Orlaith took the seeds, she said she was going to become the new Druid King.
What do you need me to do?
I'll take the seeds and deliver them to the circles.
I'll meet you at the druid cavern.
Why are the druids helping the city?
I'll board the skiff when I'm ready.
What will Archdruid Orlaith do with Sir Stefan?
Take care of yourself, Quen.

I try to keep your components varied and plentiful. Towards that end I have been trying to fish more frequently. I find it quite relaxing, as well as an excellent excuse for drinking while the sun is up.
One of the Khajiit put a lizard in my bed roll. It's difficult to laugh at a practical joke when your whole life feels like one. Your delivery is enclosed.
On my way to mail this, I noticed a city guard was following me. When I confronted him, he told me I was just being paranoid. That's impossible. I'm the opposite of paranoid. I suffer from delusions that people like me.
I wish I could afford a mount. I imagine the best thing about traveling on horseback is that you no longer have to step in the mess other people's horses leave behind.
If you are ever offered something called "pumpkin wine," you should pour the stuff anywhere but into your own mouth. I was not so lucky.
Pacrooti sends you another delivery of fine materials. He looks at the wood, and he wonders what will become of it? Will it form the crib of a child? The desk of a great scholar? The roof that protects a loving family? He hopes so, because he got a great many splinters in his rump collecting it.
This one is forwarding your supplies from a tavern that serves fine mead. Pacrooti drank all night with a very nice werewolf. When dawn came, the werewolf transformed into a fat Breton with bad teeth. Pacrooti thinks it is wise to avoid getting bitten by a fat Breton.
Esteemed employer, another shipment for you. I was among relatives today, cousins, and I had forgotten that my penchant for the art of enchantment is  irregular amongst our people. I distrust and abhor most uses of magic, though enchantment is a family tradition. My father was a journeyman, having learned the art from the Altmer.
Another day, another shipment for the esteemed employer! There are few weapons that feature a design as elegant as the sword, and a sharp edge provides balance and control to its wielder that blunt weapons or unwieldy axes lack. And there is no personal arm finer than an enchanted sword, regardless of what the Nords and the Elves say.
Esteemed employer, this is Abnab. Ignore my brother's previous letter. I know that, were I in your position, I would appreciate being kept abreast of all goings-on regarding my employees. Thus, I provide detailed reports in my correspondence, along with the components, and will continue to do so.
Ecstatic employer, I am writing to you from atop a pile of my own filth. But I didn't let that get in the way of work. The shipment is of the quality you are accustomed. My life has taken an interesting turn of late. I don't ever remembering being so free. I wonder if this is how a cliffracer feels, flying in the sky, as they do, so high.
I am glad I found my calling as an enchantment specialist, I could not work in another field. I happened upon a professional chef in our travels this week and that Dunmer gourmet gave me a look of disgust that made me want to disappear. I was eating a kwama egg, lightly seasoned with moon sugar (my momentary skooma addiction led to a craving).
May these components avail you. And may Leki avail my brother Ezdab, who will not stop filling his mind with the senseless drivel of the Sword Saint legends! In our latest excursion, we fought a harpy, as we do--repulsive creatures--and he swung a circular blow that took the harpy's head and nearly shaved my ear! He's going to get us killed.

My new business is no longer "The Bolt Hole." Last night a crowd of drunken sailors arrived. From the name alone, they expected my new establishment to be a house of ill repute! To avoid further confusion, I changed the name to "Bolts in Bulk."
Wharf Dog Melloy, a Breton with a Khajiit-tail necklace. Low-Neck, an Argonian who says he is best at "stealing things." Cuts First, who beneath her extensive scars is either a spindly Nord or a stocky High Elf. I must hire one of them to appease the Anvil dockworkers. Very well! I'll give each a trial day and see who outworks the rest.
Cuts First threw a knife at me when I told her to move some barrels. I found Wharf Dog Melloy sleeping off the skooma shakes in my office. Low-Neck is missing, along with my ledger. Thankfully I'd hidden today's delivery, or he'd have made off with your package.
Have you heard the phrase "squeeze blood from a stone," or some variation? I met a member of the Mages Guild who assures me this relates to some rather infamous gargoyle experiments. I'm not sure if I should believe him. He insisted Vanus Galerion was born a Snow Elf. I insisted he'd had too much to drink.
Another bad dream last night. A million voices, screaming the same word over and over. I couldn't make it out. I suppose that's for the best.
Pacrooti would like you to know that the original owner of these components did not deserve them. They will have a much better home with you.
Pacrooti has heard of the Yokudan Sword Saints, or Ansei, who had mastered their sword techniques so thoroughly that they could access abilities similar to a mage's spells. Pacrooti imagines that his training in the way of the Whispering Fang requires similar mental and physical discipline, but the Whispering Fang has never helped him to fly.
The list of people Pacrooti would not trust with his top-quality components is longer than Pacrooti's tongue. Pacrooti wants you to know he refuses to do business with the finest bowcrafters in the land because he knows he will not have enough for you. Please continue to employ Pacrooti. He begs you.
Pacrooti has always wondered how much a mage utilizes the practice of their art in life. Pacrooti is a master of the Whispering Fang, and its techniques, like a fine mist, make its way into everything Pacrooti does. Pacrooti forgoes the stairs, for instance, when he could climb a tree, instead. Do mages fly when faced with stairs?
Pacrooti does not know when this shipment will reach you, but he hopes you find the components well. For once in his life, Pacrooti chased a spriggan instead of the other way around. With firebrand in hand, Pacrooti terrorized it for all the times the spriggan's sisters terrorized Pacrooti. It ran off a cliff and became the components you hold.
Speaking in the first-person is something Pacrooti will never be able to grasp, he thinks. Pacrooti has trouble understanding those Khajiit who have mastered that nuance of the common tongue. Combining that speech with a Khajiiti rasp and accent, and it sounds to Pacrooti like a little man or mer speaking out of a Khajiit face. Most disturbing.
Remember the time I punched the mammoth? I learned a valuable lesson that day—mammoths love mead-soaked fruit balls! As it happens, I'm carrying a pouch full of the delicious sweets at this very moment. And that gives me an idea for how to approach my meeting with Morella the Cruel. Oh, and more components are included with this missive.
Plucky and I watched from the tree line as the mammoth trampled through the clearing, trying to get to the mead-soaked fruit balls I tossed to Morella the Cruel. We stayed just long enough to make sure Morella and her gang were fully engaged, then we ran as fast as we could. I guess Bthunzel will have to wait until things calm down.
The eagle scattered the birds in all directions. Then the eagle swooped again, this time right at the three Daedric cultists. I barely hefted my warhammer and got in a couple of whacks before the cultists began to run. The cowards! Not to miss my opportunity, I released Plucky and the rabbit. Then we fled toward the village on the hill.
Congratulations, your Housecat has arrived! You can find your new feline friend in your Collections window. Enjoy your adventures together!
<<1>>,\n\nYour deeds in this campaign deserve recognition—you were one of our most dependable warriors. Grand Warlord Zimmeron thanks you for your efforts and offers you 15,000 gold.\n\nDreet-Wulm,\nScribe to Grand Warlord Zimmeron

After days in the wood, a night in Daggerfall was pure pleasure. A bath and a soft bed were worth every coin. Imagine my surprise when I found a man murdered the next day! The city watch is talking with every guest at the inn. Hopefully these provisions still reach you.
My aid to the town guards earned my freedom, and so once again I enjoy the brisk air and crisp cobblestone paths of Skyrim. It's quite interesting how different the grains and fruit of different lands taste. I hope these newly sourced provisions make for fresh and tasty meals!
My friend! Your humble servant Gavin returns! After much searching I have joined my dear aunt on the road. Strange how hard it was to follow in her footsteps. No matter, please enjoy the enclosed supplies!
Another day, another shipment. And another bout of nausea, I'm afraid. I can't help picturing my own glistening scales every time I remove the hide of a lizard or a snake. But at least I'm not as ill as poor Snips. My mudcrab companion is one unhappy crustacean. But we have an appointment with the alchemist. Soon everything will be better.
They call the chef at Jorunn's Stand Makes-Many-Soups. Luckily, she has just one pot to cook in. She can't make a new soup until the pot is emptied. As I consider how to keep Snips from becoming tomorrow's dinner, I'm spreading tales of how diners have gotten ill eating Makes' current soup. That should keep the pot full until an idea strikes me.
Dear patron, you don't know how hard it was for me to say goodbye and leave Windhelm. I'm going to miss Innsold Cold-Moon. She advanced my understanding of Nord practices by leaps and bounds--literally! I'm even going to miss her sister, who broke down and hugged me when I told her I had a way to bring the Green Hood back to life.
Patron. Now that you have entered into a partnership with Uraviin Dres, there will be a few changes. First, I will be unable to send you personalized notes for the foreseeable future. That's just not my cup of flin. Second, your regular shipments will continue. Third, I will avenge myself against Veesk. After all, I am a scion of House Dres.
My tavern should be ready for its grand opening very soon. I'm going to call the place "Hammer and Saw" because woodworking means so much to me. I'm one busy Orc! Crafting supplier, tavern owner, dealer in dubiously acquired goods, conveyer of illicit materials—like I said, an entrepreneur! Speaking of which, your materials are enclosed.
You're probably wondering what could have happened to make old Margog the Hammer into a melancholy horker. Where's the happy-go-lucky Orc with a million ideas that I hired, you're probably asking yourself. Well, he feels bad about something that happened the other day. And instead of evaporating like so much dew, that feeling remains. Guilt.
My life was much simpler and clear-cut when I was just a woodworker, before I became an entrepreneur. Now things have become exceedingly complex. I find I need to be much more subtle in my dealings. Not everything can be dealt with using a hammer and a nail. That was the thought going through my head as I went out to deal with Constable Chedric.
The good constable was surprised to see me when I entered his tiny keep. It was basically a two-story, free-standing tower that served as his office, the town jail, and his living quarters. The life of a law officer certainly isn't glamorous, but I don't suppose glamour is what drives that sort of person. I closed the door behind me.
"This one would like to know, have you dealt with our problem?" Splendid-Paws asked. "Speak plainly," I retorted, "you know I can't understand when you speak cat." Anger flared across the crime lord's eyes, but he composed himself and said, "Constable Chedric. Did you do as this one asked and had the law-enforcer eliminated?"
Hello. It is me again, Aksel. Aksel Rockbiter. I hope you used my first delivery to make swords that kill people. I like swords. Sharp ones are best, but sometimes I cut myself with them. Anyway, here are some supplies. Enjoy!
I am sorry if you ran out of supplies. Here are more. Please do not fire me. I had to travel very far to find them. I was late getting home and Mother was very worried. She hit me many times. - Aksel
I hope you like what I found for you today. I am very proud of myself. I had to fight a big bear and two little bears for it! The little bears bit my ankles. That hurt but I can still walk. Slowly. Enjoy your supplies.
I am better now. Narasgi likes me again, I am sure. And when Mother talks about her, I do the ignore. This makes me happy. I hope you are happy with your supplies. - Your friend very much, Aksel
Hello, my friend! Another good day today. I spent it with Narasgi. We looked for your supplies, of course. Enjoy your day! - Aksel
Are you happy with your supplies? Narasgi says your happiness is very important to us. Please let Mother know if you are not happy. She handles all our complaints. - Aksel of The Aksel Rockbiter Supply Company
Gwendis volunteered to respond to Lyam's invitation to accompany him to the High King's ball for me. She's such a good friend! She let him know that I would be both honored and delighted to attend the ball as his companion for the evening. Now all I have to do is wait patiently for the night of the ball. Arrgh! I don't do patiently very well.
I couldn't stand being cooped up in the castle for another moment, so I grabbed my pack and headed out to acquire more enchanting components for my clients. It was either that or go mad waiting for word to arrive from Lyam. His silence can be infuriating at times! Not a note since the ball! But my work provides a distraction--for the most part.
Wait a moment. Didn't Jakothon ask if he could call upon me? Yes, I believe he did. Is that what's in this sealed envelope? An invitation from a Resolute of Stendarr requesting a romantic meeting with a vampire? Well, I was hoping for some excitement. I guess I won't know for sure until I read the letter. In the meantime, here are your materials.
Mazular had his followers bring Jakothon out so I could see him. He had been beaten, and he was bound up and blindfolded, but he appeared to be mostly intact. When he sensed my proximity, Jakothon called out, "Don't trust the Redguard, my lady!" This earned the Resolute another strike across the head. "I'll help you, Mazular," I proclaimed.
Mazular directed me to a wagon and pulled away the tarp that covered it, revealing a mound of fresh earth. In the mound was a runestone, a rune still embedded within its oddly shaped surface. "Free the Celerity rune from its housing and you and the Resolute can go free," Mazular said. "After you create a specific glyph for me, of course."

This one can be annoyingly acerbic at times. He knows it is a character flaw. However, Zukki recently noticed that his caustic demeanor unintentionally frightens small children, so it may not be entirely without merit.
Zukki has decided that the reason he hates all people is because he considers himself to be the best of them, and he know precisely how bad he is. Your delivery is attached.
The female called Naamah continues to annoy this one to no end. This is probably because she lacks the power of conversation, but not the power of speech. Every time she opens her mouth, Zukki gets a fierce desire to be lonesome.
This one does not like politics, nor does he trust politicians. When he was a kitten, he was told that anyone could become Emperor. He is beginning to believe it.
Why is it that every time Zukki opens his mouth, some idiot starts making speeches? Here is your delivery.
Hello from Anvil, dear. There's an ache in my knees and the sky's the color of steel, so Granny's arrived just in the nick of time. Sent this off on the last ship braving the sea. Now off to visit the lighthouse keeper. Old friend of Granny's, you know?
Granny thinks she paid too much for this extra cart in Anvil, you'd think it about to fall apart the way it's creaking. Granny can see some of those Covenant hooligans throwing her dirty looks, but none of them has the gumption to complain.
And off they go, darn fools, to Imperial City. Granny'd like to see someone teach them some manners, but she's not going to see them again, she reckons. Just a few years ago Granny could make the trip, but she's not as spry these days.
Discerning Customer, this one is contacting you in regard to your account with Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods. There is nothing wrong with your account; however, you have not responded to the wondrous deals offered by Granny Gravius's Rarefied Relics and Antiques. This one wishes to know if you've received our mailings. Fulfillment by Hawker.
GREAT REWARD: Lost Cat -- Missing about a week, used to being indoors -- please consult illustrated likeness -- answers to Mangy Tim, or food. Please contact Hawker at Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods with any information. He is missed.
When I speak of my trade to others, I'm often met with confusion. I know it's not uncommon for Wood Elves to trade for wooden wares, but to make a career out of it does stand out. I can't help it though, my love for woodworking simply cannot be ended! Please enjoy yourself on my behalf as you craft items from the materials in this shipment.
It's odd that my Wood Elf companions are quieter than the group of Redguards I traveled with. The look in their eyes makes the back of my neck crawl, especially when I'm trading for your crafting materials. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be with this group. But have no fear! I'll still make sure my shipments are timely and well stocked.
Lately a young Khajiit named Nullini has been asking me questions about the Pact. I'm not sure if she's perhaps considering converting to the Green Pact (an odd choice for someone of her kind), but for now I've decided it's simply a curiosity of the unknown. And who am I to judge her for holding an interest outside the norms of her race?
I'm shocked by how many believe that Wood Elves still eat corpses! I know it's not entirely out of practice, but to think that we all still uphold this tradition is ridiculous. Even Nullini asked me, and I answered so angrily we haven't spoken since. Despite what they may think, the Khajiit were still willing to trade with me for this shipment.
Nullini was upset that I've decided to leave the group, but I believe she understands. I was tempted to ask her to travel with me, but she's actually just recently became engaged! I couldn't be happier for my dear friend and her wife-to-be. If you receive any letters from her, please ignore them! I assure you, I'm quite happy with my current wage.
Mag has quite a bit of advice for me, all unsolicited. First and foremost, he believes that I should grow a beard. ''Ain't right, a grown man with no proper beard!'' he tells me, stroking his own rather remarkable, crumb covered whiskers. I simply nod rather than argue. At least he's a steady supply of crafting materials for my shipments to you.
Little ones can be as curious as Khajiit, and the children in this family are no exception. They'll often ask me about the Pact, and honestly I'm a tad surprised their parents have never explained the practice. Well, it's not my place to ask. I'll just bother you with all my silly thoughts! I hope this shipment can make up for my prattling.
I'm sorry if this letter is short. Last night Banion brought out some jagga he had traded for. I'm afraid I drank a tad too much. Please enjoy this shipment.
He cracked the anvil. I'm so mad I could spit. Forgive me. Here's your order.
I can only assume the components provided by the Four Irons have served beyond your greatest expectations. We remain humbly at your service.
Are all Orcs so single-mindedly fixated on the physicality of action? This boy has almost no concept of subtlety or finesse. If an act is not punctuated with the percussion of violence, it seems to hold no value. I thought he might explode at any moment when I made him carefully pour our last batch of ingots into their molds. He still has to scour the first batch off the walls and floor.
Urbek has smashed you best letter to date. Urbek think you not even know it Urbek who send it if you never seen Urbek's prototyping. This way not as fun for writing, but Urbek see potential.
You should know that Urbek's more conventional studies are coming along quite well, as you've no doubt noticed in the quality of the components being delivered. He's finally beginning to acquire the trademark Laumont flourish.
Farrokh inform Urbek that there are words for gentle smashing in Tamrielic. When Little Chief Laumont write his fancy letters and gently smash seal in wax it called ''pressing.'' Urbek still prefer to smash letters, but see why that confusing to others.
Urbek thank you for your patronage. It only because of patrons like you that Urbek get to study at prestigious institution like Four Irons Smeltery. Urbek hope you donate to education fund so that others like Urbek can get same opportunity.
Don't worry, Urbek not really care if you donate to Four Irons. Urbek sure you already pay enough for Urbek to send you things for smashing. Urbek do hope you are smashing best you can smash.
Urbek greet you and sorry not to smash you letter since leaving suddenly. Urbek has been busy with family. Clan Tumnosh problems with Dwarf things not all bad. Urbek smash a few apart and then smash them into prototype. Urbek smash you this letter with it.
I, Valgus, have arrived at a remote Ayleid ruin located by the Velothril Sisters and scouted by a previous employee. I am fully prepared for whatever dangers may lurk within, be they ghost, creature, or bandit. Tomorrow I will send you the first of many deliveries culled from the ruin. I look forward to sharing what I pull from within!
If you have never hidden within a bale of hay on a moving cart, allow me to share my thoughts. First, it is extremely uncomfortable. The hay above you leaves no cushion against the cart's juddering on unstable roads. Next, hay is stiff and painful--enough to scratch the thickest scales. Finally, it's worth it if the trip ends with your freedom.
We at Velothril Sisters were disheartened to learn of the demise of our employee, Sixul. We hope this complimentary delivery can allay the inconvenience. We are currently reviewing the most capable employee to continue with your account. Until then, we leave you in the capable hands of Valyne Hlan, the procurer who stocks our personal reserves.
If Eron Salt seeks my trail in remote villages, the city where I started is the safest place to travel. I'm also running low on food. (And I refuse to eat mushrooms that grew in troll dung.)
The Little Scrapper set sail today, and I with it. Velothril Sisters bounty hunters, Mages Guild adepts ... who shall pursue me next? Khajiiti boatswains excluded, of course. (Even the clever ones.)
I buried Eron Salt today. I wasn't sure how her people did it, what words they say. But I know enough about vengeful spirits to avoid creating new ones.
Greetings <<1>>!\n\nThe Circle of Champions has noticed your tenacity in recent Battleground matches, shown by your significant number of medals earned. With each bout you become a greater gladiator than you were before. Such an undertaking merits encouragement, and I hope this reward helps you with the matches to come. Keep at it, Gladiator!\n\n-Battlemaster Rivyn

Battlegrounds are three team player-vs-player arenas that allow you to test your skills against other players in a number of different game modes. Queuing for a Battleground with a party of fewer than 4 players will fill a group with other players so you will be able to participate. After the Battleground has ended, any players added to your party for the match will be removed and you will be returned to where you were before you entered the Battleground.\n\nTo participate in a Battleground, open the |cFFFFFFActivity Finder|r and select |cFFFFFFBattlegrounds|r. Select if you want to play a |cFFFFFFRandom Battleground|r or a |cFFFFFFRandom Solo Battleground|r. Press the |cFFFFFFJoin Queue|r button and you will be queued for a Battleground. When the Battleground is ready, you will receive a ready check notification while you are out of combat. Accepting this will confirm you are ready to start the Battleground.
