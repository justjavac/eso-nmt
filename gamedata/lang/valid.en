This is what the NPC says to the player when offering a quest.
Go out there and bring my soldier's back.
The Kinlords are united. At least on this. I am certain that buy tomorrow they will be arguing over what to have for lunch.\n\nI have packed their Batons of Fidelity in this coffer. I believe you should have the honor of presenting them to the Queen.
It's a fight that's long overdue, but it's Clan Murtag's fight, not yours.\n\nYour fight is with the ogres. I need you to kill Skull Crusher and stop the ogres from coming through the mountain.
You … you would do that? I want it to be perfect. Breloth… she had such exquisite taste. \n\nMy father said she was 'high-upkeep', but I loved the way she just knew what she liked. She would've wanted her funeral to be special.
My daughter! And if they've harmed one hair, I'll salt all Tamriel with their blood!\n\nI just have to find her. There was something in the dream … a cultist standing over Rozenn, reading a scroll. It's … it's on Nightmare Crag! Out of my way!
The enemy has stolen the Elder Scroll of Chim! I need heroes to reclaim it. Can I count you among their number?
We seek the Elder Scroll of Altadoon, currently in the hands of our enemies. It must become ours, its blessings bestowed upon the Pact's soldiers.\n\nWhen it has been captured, return to me.
I am concentrating our forces in an effort to seize the Elder Scroll of Chim. This is a vital mission that requires our finest soldiers. Join these troops as soon as you can!
"Soldiers of the Dominion! Our former stronghold of Castle Alessia is in enemy hands and must be taken back. The first step is to determine the enemy's strength. Scouts are urgently needed."
"The Covenant needs information on the forces defending Aleswell Farm. Scouts who return with reports will be well rewarded.\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
"The enemy is building siege engines with wood from the Aleswell Lumbermill. We must have scouting reports on its defenses before we attack. Volunteers are needed!"
"The Chalman Lumbermill supplies wood for the enemy's siege weapons and defensive works. Grand Warlord Dortene needs scouts to report on this site's defenses.\n\n- Gen. Khamagash"
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron wants to recapture Kingscrest Keep. Scouts are needed to discern enemy strength there. Step forward, warriors!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron needs information on the farm at Fort Ash. Scouts are urgently needed for this mission.\n\n- General Dar-Liurz"
"The enemy uses wood from Aleswell Lumbermill to build its siege engines. An assault is planned but we must have scouting reports first. Volunteers are needed!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"Castle Bloodmayne will be ours once again! Grand Warlord Sorcalin has called for an all-out assault on this fortress. Spread the word to every Dominion warrior!\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Grand Warlord Sorcalin wants the mine at Kingscrest Keep. We need its stone to help fortify our castles. Warriors are needed immediately!\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Chalman Farm supplies the enemy with enough food to outlast any siege. Grand Warlord Sorcalin's orders are to take the farm and deprive our foes of those resources.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Farragut Farm supplies the enemy with enough food to outlast any siege. Grand Warlord Sorcalin's orders are to take the farm and deprive our foes of those resources.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Grand Warlord Sorcalin wants the enemy lumbermill at Glademist attacked. All warriors are urged to participate.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
"Grand Warlord Sorcalin wants the enemy lumbermill at Castle Bloodmayne attacked. All warriors are urged to participate.\n\n- Scribe Fireluin"
Four of my sisters have gone north to cleanse the stones, but they need protection. Corrupted creatures attack them before they can destroy the foul vines that choke the stones.\n\nYou must go and help them.
We're dealing with a literal undead uprising! Our patrols sweep the wilds while our primary wizard, Gabrielle Benele, searches for a magical relic that will help.\n\nBut I'm concerned. Some of our patrols haven't returned.
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron commands all warriors to attack the enemy at Castle Black Boot. This fortress must fall to the Pact.\n\n- General Jeggord"
"Rayles Farm must no longer support our foes. Join the assault, warriors of the Pact!\n\n- General Jeggord"
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron believes the farm at Kingscrest Keep is poorly defended. He wants this taken from the enemy.\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron believes the farm at Drakelowe Keep is poorly defended. He wants this taken from the enemy.\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"Grand Warlord Zimmeron wants Ash Mine captured. Answer the call, warriors!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"The lumbermill at Kingscrest Keep must be taken from our enemies, by Grand Warlord Zimmeron's decree. All warriors are needed!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"The lumbermill at Castle Bloodmayne must be taken from our enemies, by Grand Warlord Zimmeron's decree. All warriors are needed!\n\n- Scribe Dreet-Wulm"
"For too long, the farm at Drakelowe Keep has fed our enemies. Grand Warlord Dortene calls for this farm to be overwhelmed!\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
"Faregyl Farm must no longer feed our foes. Join the assault, warriors of the Covenant!\n\n- General Am-Shadal"
"Black Boot Farm must no longer feed our foes. Join the assault, warriors of the Covenant!\n\n- General Am-Shadal"

"By order of Grand Warlord Dortene, Alessia Mine must be captured!\n\n- Scribe Grulzul"
Have you come to prove your worth, recruit? Balfiera has become a land of war and death, a land with no place for the weak. Enter this land of death, and do not return until you have slain thirty of our enemies.
If we are to take and hold Cyrodiil we have to know what fortifications the enemy has and which ones we may take. You will be our eyes.
Yes. I serve Hermaeus Mora, the Lord of Fate and Knowledge. These ruins were once a shrine to my lord, a storehouse of secrets forbidden to mortals.\n\nThe shrine is but a memory now, but an entity invades the ruins seeking to steal the secrets.
I need time to prepare the ritual that will bring this to an end.\n\nWe have to delay the Covenant troops to the south.
These pissant Dunmer!\n\nI know an Argonian named <<1>> who can make a salve to soothe the injured, but <<2>> won't work with him or any Argonian.
We want to bestow a unique gift to this battlefield, a sacrifice to allow plants and trees to grow again.\n\nEven a dry swamp regrows after many rains.
Khajiiti pirates! They're raiding our village—taking slaves and supplies. I gathered our survivors here, but I won't leave without Leel-Vata.\n\nCursed cats! And where were the Dark Elves? Their fleet is supposed to guard the coast.
Absolutely. Troll's Blood, anything could break us apart these days. How do you think the Argonians and my fellow Nords will react to this? If Tanval summons yet another magical juggernaut into the Ashlands, it could very well be the end of the Pact.
My unit was sent here because a stableboy made it to Ebonheart and reported a slave revolt.\n\nOh, gods! He butchered them. He killed his own soldiers.
<<1>> is one of our little fish, our eyes and ears. He signals when he possesses urgent information for the vicecanons. A short while ago, we received his signal.\n\nBe swift and silent as currents in a stream. Speak with <<1>> on our behalf.
I'm Saryvn, a soldier from the fort. I, er, might have crept down to the river to enjoy a quiet drink away from my superiors. \n\nDon't look at me like that. Anyway, these stupid cultists grabbed me. Next thing I knew, I was locked in here.
These Supernal Dreamers have stolen and shattered my Crystal of Power.  Fortunately, I think my wizard can repair the crystal if I give him all the shards.
I heard sounds of battle, and a voice shouting for someone named <<1>> to run. The Worm Cult likely attacked some unlucky travelers.\n\nMy advice? Find this <<1>> before the Worm Cult adds him to their collection of undead slaves.
Did what I was taught to do. When outnumbered, I hide. Not the bravest move, but it kept the two of us alive.\n\nListen, if you're going down there, I could use your help. I need some things from the camp.
Xal Ithix relies on scavenging for its livelihood. Instead of hunting their usual prey, stranglers now attack the scavengers.
I want to see a fair fight, but that can't happen here. Judgment keeps your silly gods at bay.\n\nThere's only one sure course. You must die by the hammer Vox wields. Once you enter her realm, you can collapse it from within.
<Beneath the corpse lies a bundle of notes.>\n\n"Day Seven: Damned dark in that cave. Under the sun, I can see the construct shows signs of dormancy rather than total failure."
Ah, you're not one of them. The Renrijra pirates are camped right on top of an Argonian ruin my partner and I came here to study.\n\nLooks like they're excavating. Probably finding treasure … lots of treasure.
What do you mean, what do I mean? Your invitation to attend Shad Astula, of course.\n\nOh, my—you really have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Three students arrived with you. The Dunmeri Lena and Tedras, and the Nord Hadmar.\n\nIt is your solemn duty to make sure they pass their initiation tests.
Hey, this is your quest. Get me out of here.
Yes. Poke the widget to make him appear, then kill him dead!
You must kill the Beast.
The Reachmen are gathering in the Wood. Gjakil needs all able blades to head there right away!
I've been tracking the beast for weeks. I call him Deathclaw. \n\nI finally caught up to him, but it … well, it went badly.
They're alert, looking for something. Had to kill the one behind me before he warned the others.
The shrine to the goddess Kyne. We come here to pray and ask for her blessing before battle.\n\nThe rest of our brigade went to visit the shrine yesterday. They haven't returned yet and I'm worried about them.
My father is still weak from the poison, but he's recovering. I'm organizing things while he gets his strength back.\n\nI need to regain the confidence of our Dark Elf and Argonian allies. My regrettable actions at Fort Amol have made them wary.
Thieves. Damn them all to Oblivion! My family banner's been stolen. It's been an heirloom of my house for hundreds of years.
The Bad Man is one of the old gods, the source of all strife and the god of crop failure. According to local tradition, appeasing him will ensure a good harvest. Superstitious nonsense, but an excellent excuse for a festival!
As many stories as there have been Silvenars. Going back to the first Bosmer, no doubt!\n\nBut the story the spinners are telling now, it's all wrong. It must change back before it's too late.
As our ship neared <<1:)>>, a black fog spread across the waters. Soon after, Maormer raiding parties attacked and boarded the ship.\n\nMany of my shipmates were slaughtered.
I don't want to alarm Jomund, after all we've been through today. But I think that Magister Osanne sent word to the Orcrthane about the strange magical ore.  \n\nLooks like Filgdor sent someone to investigate. They set up a small camp down the road.
I hate the thought of Garil wandering through those godsforsaken chambers all alone.
Fildgor Orcthane and his Stormfists! Nothing but cowards and thieves, if you ask me.\n\nSoldiers are supposed to be honorable, noble. But they slaughtered the Voljar family. They killed unarmed civilians! And they killed my brother's wife.
We need to warn the settlements west of here. You put a stop to Stral and the Reachmen, but the Worms are a far bigger menace.
Just keeping a low profile. Since you found me, want to help me get some revenge?\n\nThe Black Dagger bandits in Hackdirt wiped out my gang. Kill ten of them and I'll reward you.
Maormer boarded us as our ship neared <<1:)>>. How they found us in that black fog, I'll never know.\n\nThey slaughtered most of the crew. Only a few of us escaped.
Shattered? Wuuthrad? What is this nonsense? You think to deceive me with wild tales?\n\nI know why you're really here. The Jarls sent you to spy on me. Either that, or you're in league with the risen dead!
Plague. Stay away if you value your life. A dozen people afflicted over the last week.
The Worm Cult is all over the Ragged Hills Altar. One of their filthy rituals, I'm sure of it.
We can't shore up the keel with saboteurs around. But we spotted a soldier nearby … looks like Khajiit royal guard and some refugees.\n\nWe'll keep the pirates off our own backs. Head to that soldier and see if you can help the refugees!
<These papers show plans to take over the Koeglin Lighthouse and extinguish the lights.>
Imperial archers posted on the river banks have made crossing impossible. If our troops can get across, we might be able to push back the Imperials. We need those archers eliminated!
You see those rabid dogs up ahead? Raiders. They swept into my camp this morning, slaughtered us nearly to a man.\n\nThey'll kill you, too, if they see you. I can't stay here forever—there must be a way through them.
<<1>>. That's where the chieftain sent our warriors to lie in wait.\n\nIf the Silvenar's held by our clan, he will be there.
It's <<1>>! She's tricked me in the last four Boasts! She always gets the better of me. This year I want to best her, and I know just how to do it. She's obsessed with Khajiiti puzzle boxes. I saw one in Yanabir's tent ….
True enough, you don't look like a Houndsman.\n\nWe used to have a regular influx of pilgrims to <<1>> to pray at the shrine of the Green Lady. That is, until recently.
Captain Rama has fled Cumberland's Watch. \n\nHis comrades' blood is on his hands. He must be brought to justice for his crimes.
Master Telenger has lead us to a very interesting project here. If you'd like more details, speak to Andewen on the north side of the chasm. She's running the camp while the Artificer is inside the caves.
Yes, yes. Very interesting project here. If you'd like more details, speak to Andewen on the north side of the chasm. She's running the camp while Master Telenger is inside the caves.
We've got a little situation here, but we have things under control. If you're looking to make a difference, we could use some reinforcements.\n\nWould you carry word to Skywatch?
I was hiding from the other guys. All they've done since I joined is pick on me. Being a bandit isn't anything like my brother and I thought it'd be.\n\nPlease, it's too late for me but not for him. Take this to <<1>>, he'll know what it means.
Suit yourself. Just south of my home, you'll find the Petitioning Stone.\n\nJust touch it. Probably, nothing will happen. If he wants to speak with you though, he'll appear when you touch that stone.
Daedra, out of the Moonhenge. When the undead appeared in Driladan Pass, we got cut off from Marbruk, and in the Daedra came, like beasts that smelled blood.
"A young Khajiit wandered into camp last night, said he's looking for <<1>>. If anyone asks where I am, I'm dragging this fool off to <<2>>. He'll see the boss before his head and body part ways."
My father's very sick. So are many of our warriors. Many have even died.\n\nOur water was poisoned, probably by these foul necromancers—the Withered Hand. They seek to weaken the Ash'abah so that we cannot stand against them.
Just waiting to be asked stupid questions by strangers, what else? I'm watching. And waiting for my brother Klovag, who's late as usual. When he finally gets here, we're gonna wipe this place out.
Nothing better than causing massive damage on the battlefield, is there?\n\nIf you want to know more about rams and oil, talk to Lirtis. For trebuchets, catapults, and ballistae, speak with Looks-Forward.
It is a place of decay, a place even the gods do not acknowledge. It is where the dishonored dead are sent. \n\nWhen one has shamed themselves beyond redemption, his or her body is dumped here, unwashed, and unconsecrated.
Only the most important military advancement in the Second Era! \n\nThese ships you see here—I designed them—they're going to revolutionize naval warfare! But not if we lose the designs!
Everything you've done convinces me … I almost feel silly saying it, but it's all there. The Mane has fallen and you've saved my city. Traveler, I believe you are the Moon Hallowed.
We escaped Tava's Blessing, but it was all too much for his heart. \n\nHe needs consecration but I'm terrified to leave his body. The necromancers are everywhere.
The king of the Wood Elves informs me there's some manner of discontent in <<1>>, our capital city.\n\nMeet with <<2>> and work to end the discord. Once local matters are in hand, I'll meet you in <<1>>.
I am unimportant. Only what I've done matters, and what I can do to fix it.\n\nI've waited for an opportunity to right this wrong since I escaped. Have you any strong love for the Imperials, or can you help?
A girl has to have a few secrets, doesn't she?\n\nMy master, Verandis Ravenwatch, asked me to find you. He'd like to talk to you at his estate, Ravenwatch Castle. It's west of Shornhelm, right outside the town of Crestshade.
Our house is just a shell of what it once was …. I doubt anyone survived.\n\nBut you can save the city. Help the Evermore soldiers keep these animals from going any farther!
Yes, thank you for pointing that out. \n\nThe last place I saw our dog, <<1>>, was near the fork in the road that leads to <<2>>, just west of here.\n\nTake this whistle. Use it when you get to the fork in the road. I'll wait here in case he comes home.
"The blood-curse burning through my body matters not. Nor do I regret my coming demise. I regret only that I will never see <<1>> again. At least, I pray I never see her again."
As I set up camp in the central chamber of this cave, a large spider bit my leg.\n\nI awoke to find myself in this unfortunate position, while the man I accompany wanders unattended.
You? Can you even read Ayl— Never mind. You have the look of an adventurer, and maybe that is what I need now more than another scholar. It was a stone fragment etched with Ayleid runes, found by a fisherman who claimed it washed up on shore.
"Beware all travelers! The Deep Graves are no longer safe for pilgrims. Do not listen to the wisps."\n\n<Below the notice, there is an addendum in a different hand.>
Most of Lady Lleraya's followers fell quickly after you defeated her. But a few of her toughest, most loyal vampires have hidden themselves away like vermin under a rock.\n\nWe've rooted out a few, but the work is dangerous and slow going.
Not yet … but it is possible. The Elves in this part of the Valenwood do not follow King Camoran. They claim to be subjects of the "Wilderking," some forest spirit no one has ever seen.\n\nThey mock the Dominion and call Queen Ayrenn an enemy!
A few days ago, our research team was sent to excavate this ruined city.\n\nBut things turned bad quickly. The water inside is cursed. Half the researchers are insane or dead. We sent a runner for reinforcements, but I guess he didn't make it.
"In the event of enemy forces sighted approaching the mainland, our top priority is to secure Dhalmora's shoreline watchtower and ensure the fires are lit. Delay is death!\n\n—Holgunn One-Eye"
Some sort of celestial object. A few of the locals call it the Mage's staff. They say it fell from above just before the constellations vanished.\n\nIt's extremely volatile, and every magic-addicted sorcerer and atronach in the region is drawn to it.
<On the remains of the Celestial Mage, a single gem fall loose. This can serve as proof to the Undaunted of your conquest.>
"Warriors:\n\nIt is the will of Grand Warlord Zimmeron that bounties be offered for killing Dominion and Covenant Nightblades. Slay 20 or more of these foes and you are entitled to a reward."
My champion, Titus, who I called across the sands of time in my moment of need, is fading. His mortal mind can't deal with the shift in his reality.\n\nThe longer he remains here, the more likely he will lose all that he is.
Elden Hollow! Daedra are springing up like weeds in the shadows of the Elden Tree. Must be something in the soil.\n\nPick up a scythe and get hacking!
A good woodworker sees the final product before cutting the first block of wood.\n\nBut I can't teach two crafts once. If you commit yourself to the training, I'll certify you.
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. PLEASE BRING IT.
<The old pack contains a medallion on a long, silver chain. Two moons are etched upon the metal coin. It looks like Khajiit crafting.>
<<1>> robbed me of my husband's mind, but <<2>> is to blame. She secretly worships Boethiah—the Daedric Prince of murder.\n\nHer prayers brought about <<3>>'s death. I just … I haven't found the proof.
I need something to draw the attention of the cultural competition judges. Something … spectacular.\n\nThat's why I want to cook a stew inside a bear's head. You with me?
Bored! The Rat is so very bored! No more fights in the arena—no, no. Just Daedra feeding people to their ugly pets. Day and night, it's nothing but merchants, and tailors, and stable boys screaming and soiling their pants. What sport is that?
By order of the General:\n\nScouts are hereby ordered to secure the Memorial District rally point in preparation for an assault. Proceed to the surface via the ladder-works, establish control, then plant the Alliance banner to signal the "all clear."
Laborers from all over Tamriel have come to Orsinium, eager to carve out a better life. I'm sure I don't need to tell you, it's arduous work. They need hearty meals to stay strong, and there's not enough to go around.
"WANTED: A group of warriors to cleanse an abomination from Hrota Cave.\n\n"For years, Exulus the Wispmother haunted Hrota Cave, draining the life from all who enter. This undead evil must be wiped away. Its many victims cry for justice!"
"Halls of Judgment? Pah, a gilded, empty promise! Any sense of justice there has long since been strangled by the bickering of lawyers. Deliver my judgment to one of these vermin and give me hope for change."
"This voucher provides the bearer with one cake for special occasions from the renowned baker, Chef Donolon."
"One careless jest cost my brother his life. A playful shove into the frigid waters off the Windhelm Docks and he was gone. I don't care that they tried to save him. That it was an accident. My brother is dead, and they must answer for it."
"The Thalmor have been threatening harsh punishment toward their detractors. We would like to stir up dissent and sacrifices will need to be made. Target citizens in Auridon so we can attribute the murders to the Thalmor."
"The milk-drinkers at the Riften Fighters Guild wouldn't honor my request for rat extermination. I've lost half my stores of cheese! I want you to exterminate the real vermin infesting our Fighters Guild."
The restless spirits in Shael Ruins are … well, they're restless. It's causing problems.\n\nIf you still have the guts, here's more <<z:1>> to place around the ruins. That should bind the spirits—that and killing whatever riled them this time.
"Initiate. A situation has developed in Kvatch that requires our immediate attention. Find me in the Sanctuary and I'll provide additional instructions. \n\n"—Astara"
I'm an initiate in the Order of Star-Gazers. We study the stars and their influence on Tamriel.\n\nNot long ago, we noticed irregularities in three of the star signs. Shortly thereafter, strange armies overran Craglorn.
The Anka-Ra. The cursed Yokudan army that has invaded Craglorn! They serve the Celestial Warrior, but their true master is their general, a man of unmatched cruelty named Tarish-Zi.\n\nI can help defeat him and the Anka-Ra, if you'll only listen.
The little goat asks questions but it is not in its place to speak to an Iron Orc like that. Sometimes the knife doesn't choose the hand it winds up in or so the elders say.\n\nWill the little goat be my hand? Strike blood for blood in Lashburr's name?
Many regents serve the Scaled Court. That's why things occur within its coils that aren't under my control.\n\nFor example, the Iron Orcs are raising an army. I sent my seneschal, Little Leaf, to stop their efforts. Perhaps you could lend her a hand?
The client who hid documents in Chill Hollow hired me again. Seems you're the best courier—the only courier—to return from there.\n\nFind the correct cache and bring me what's inside. Oh, and destroy the toughest creature you find.
Wood Elf immigrants to Auridon introduced the locals of <<1>> to Mud Ball Merriment. \n\nIt is as you'd expect—mud balls thrown at everyone. But each year, there is a specific target the Wood Elves agree most needs to be humbled.
My colleague, <<1>>? We're sorcerers, he leads my circle. Or … or led, I ….\n\nWe sought to shatter a Dark Anchor at its base. To show the Fighters Guild we can do it more efficiently. So we traveled to the <<2>>, but our plan went horribly awry.
Dubdil Alar has always been a bit off his rocker, even for a Telvanni wizard. Apparently now things have gotten really out of hand. His apprentice Nara Varam needs help stopping whatever he's up to. And don't bother asking me what you need to stop.
Vampires nest within the ruins of Dushariran. I know not why or what they seek, but this desecration must not be allowed to persist. It prevents our scouts from retrieving relics from the shrine.
"This client is looking for a particular concoction, and stipulates not to ask why. As if we would." — Rolis Hlaalu.
Splendid! Now that he's finished grieving for that harpy, Ralasa, I mean. He even paid me a compliment! Something like, "I suppose you're not totally useless." It's a start!\n\nI won't keep you. I'm sure you have much to discuss with Sun-in-Shadow.
Not exactly, but now that we're certain the affliction isn't natural, we can pursue a proper solution. I suspect we'll need Chodala's staff.\n\nHow the Ashlander got his hands on Sotha Sil's tool and turned it into a weapon, I have no idea.
It seems I must delay my work for a time.\n\nWhen I reclaimed my shadow, I learned a great deal. Daedric plots. Alliances and betrayals. The return of things lost in time … the loss of things the world thought certain. I have much to do.
Reflecting … reflecting ….\n\nA Daedric presence has been detected within the Radius. Threats include several creatures from the location Evergloam, including one called Wraith-of-Crows. Current patrol factotums are unable to defeat this threat.
The Divine Prosecution has been tasked to recover Rose-Of-Archon blossoms on behalf of the Sapiarchs. Not life threatening perhaps, but still of vital importance to several of their religious ceremonies. Well worth the risks, I assure you.
Of course they're missing. My fool husband let our prized hound off her leash to frolic along the beach. Poor Eustasia didn't know what to make of her freedom and went charging off after a hare. Durell took off in pursuit and I've seen neither since.
A new cluster of time distortions appeared in the swamps and fields north of Black Marsh—Shadowfen and Deshaan specifically.\n\nTake the Augur, the seals, and this map of the region. At this point, I'm sure you know what to do with them.
<Z'Maja's amulet has shattered, and only its chain remains. It's useless to you, but may be valuable to one who wishes to learn more about Z'Maja's magic.>
Bad dreams. A great darkness, devouring Cloudrest as it filled the streets.\n\nMy mother's last letter spoke of the Welkynars capturing the Sea Sload Z'Maja, just a few days ago. If there's anything powerful enough to destroy a city, it's a Sload.
Go to the Echoing Hollow, far across the land. In that secluded bog, the rare nightbloom vine grows like weeds. Gather nightblooms and bring them here.\n\nBeware the guardian of the Hollow, though. It dislikes intruders.
No—well, for a moment there—I was practicing my swamp jelly calls when I saw you passing by. It takes just the right amount of saliva to get their tenor.\n\nI'll have to work up another mouthful, but there'll be time for that now that you're here!
Oh, forgive Tahara. Her worry gets the better of her.\n\nOne of my menagerie's most terrifying beasts escaped from its cage! I turned my back for only a moment to speak to an onlooker, you see? And pow! The monster burst free!
Many Khajiit have a … loose definition of what is legal and what is not. Old Ri'hirr included! But some take it too far.\n\nTake these two: Zav'i and Akumjhargo. They lead a pride of bandits out of Red Hands Run. Muskarsed villains, both of them!
This one saw a stranger setting up camp outside the cave nearby.\n\nLocal legend says that Mafala-worshipers used to lurk there. Risen dead too, I think. To venture so close to such a place …. It does not seem wise.
Murder, terror, you know what I mean!\n\nA whole flock of them knocked over a caravan down the road. Like kicking over an anthill, see? Boxes and carts are all wrecked. It's a mess! Then again, there might be some shinies scattered about. Never know.
And I'm recruiting people who need work. Happy coincidence, yeah?\n\nA rogue Goutfang and his students waylaid one of our supply caravans. Took a bunch of rice. We need that rice. We also need that group of adepts dead.
Lucky for us, I have work. It's tough, but it pays well.\n\nBasically, a scholar decided to study a temple. Ran astray of a guardian. Now we want that guardian dead. Oh, and the scholar's friends want any notes you can find.
One of my snitches in Grahtwood told me the New Moon is looking for a necromancer named Ethruin. Stinks of an unholy scheme to me, and I know trouble when I smell it, always followed Za'ji like a bad cologne.\n\nNeed you to go break up their meeting.
Oh, you'll like this one! Maybe. Settling the undead appeals to your heroic sensibilities, doesn't it? If so, excellent! If not, there's gold involved!\n\nA mage I know crafted these unique candle orbs. She wants them placed in the Forsaken Citadel.
Naturally. You're his second-in-command or something, aren't you?\n\nSai Sahan wants to discuss things with you before we start fighting, so you need to get back to the sanctum.
The Bards College, of course. We who pluck heartstrings and chill the blood. \n\nYears ago, our prized antique instruments were, uh, borrowed by an overzealous member. She meant to heal a rift within the college, but it only made things worse.
"We're sending food and emergency supplies to people living in the coldest reaches of Skyrim, and could use your help.\n\nAnd, of course, your discretion. I don't arrange these things for my reputation." — R. H.
These damnable cultists bested me! The witless fools believe they can summon a Dragon and return the Dragon Cult to prominence. Ha! \n\nOne of their mages bound my soul to this doll and left me to spend eternity as this repulsively adorable plaything.
What do you think? The princess just learned that her father is an evil vampire and he's about to unleash a harrowstorm on Solitude! She needs to figure out how to stop him—and she needs your help to do it!
An explorer limped into town warning of a giant Dwarven colossus endlessly building upon itself somewhere far beneath the earth. I'd say let sleeping Dwarves lie, but the explorer believes the thing will only grow more large and dangerous with time.
The attack on Markarth has begun, but we can still save the city if we hurry. Go, warn Ard Caddach. Tell him to defend his people. Every life saved is one less soul for the Dark Heart.
News of Rada al-Saran's death won't compare to the dead returning to life, but I'm sure Caddach will be relieved to hear it. \n\nYou find the ard and let him know there's nothing to fear from the Gray Host any more. Tell him he has Verandis to thank.
"Civilians displaced by the Three Banners War desperately need supplies as we resettle them throughout Tamriel.\n\nPlease craft and deliver supplies made by provisioning to Selvari Abello at the New Life Festival camp. We appreciate the help."
Well, the greeting is actually from me. My mistress isn't big on the niceties of social interaction. The message, however, is definitely meant for you.\n\nYou look just like the person she showed me in my vision-dream.
You're just liable to vanish in the marsh, like the others. Oh, sure, they all come back and laugh it off like nothing happened, but they're off. Just a hair. Heck, they just disappear again anyway!\n\nBet those carnival folk are behind it.
General Keshu the Black Fin sent me to find you. She wants to discuss arrangements for the guests you brought to Gideon. She fears their presence puts the city and its people at risk.
Those Kyncursed Waking Flame cultists are posting their propaganda all over the walls of Fargrave. Someone commissioned us to burn the pamphlets at their source, the Brandfire Reformatory.
Well, jokes about swines and passing wind don't count as entertainment. Not for a whole festival. We need music! Dancing. Something … raucous.\n\nOh! I have the perfect minstrels in mind. If you handle recruitment, I'll prepare a stage!
Shipwright's Regret. An ancient shipyard abandoned after some deadly catastrophe. All sorts of rumors about the place, but the one thing everyone agrees on is that it's haunted.\n\nBut you aren't afraid of some ghost stories, right?
Apologies! My name is Isobel Veloise. I'm an aspirant in the Sapphire Tourney, a proving ground for squires looking to join the knightly orders.\n\nAurelia's mother is knight commander, and umm … brashly offered her daughter's hand as a prize.
Possibly. He found someone who may recognize the badge on the mercenary armor that he remembers. \n\nIf he's right, that may lead us right to the bastards who took them. It was a long time ago, sure, but this is more information than I've ever had.
Tales of Tribute! It's a card game, a scavenger hunt … Z'en's price, it's practically a religion for some folks.\n\nPlayers match wits and decks in a contest of courage, preparation, and skill. You want fame? Gold? It's all there for the taking!
An agent representing all three alliances here on High Isle has a task if you're willing. A number of alliance ships have wrecked in the nearby waters lately. Each carried uniforms that could be used as disguises if they fall into the wrong hands.
Then we must assume that Count Stefan and Druid Laurel are in danger. If Lord Bacaro truly believes he's the heir to the Ivy Throne of the druids, he'll stop at nothing to get his way.\n\nWe must go to Galen and defend the remaining regalia.
I don't trust Archdruid Orlaith to spare my son, even if she gets everything she wants. I will instruct my knights to stand down. Let her think I am paralyzed by this threat. Meanwhile, we secretly work to save Stefan from the Firesong.
I can't leave Vastyr. Someone has to pick up the pieces, and that responsibility now falls on me. \n\nFind Druid Laurel. She needs to know that Archdruids Rahval and Ellic are dead. That Orlaith and the Firesong have the sacred seeds.
Yes, outsider. Animals lash out. The spirit motes that once inspired us blanket the land in a thick fog. \n\nThe Spirit of the Path may be injured or frightened. I do not know what the Firesong want or how they turned my home against me.
Take these poultices. It should at least help them get on their feet so they can get to safety.
Seek <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Their peril is our opportunity. I'm sure they'd rather work with us than with the Imperials.\n\nAsk about, search houses, but above all, be discreet.
Oh … Tu'whacca will do the cleansing. We must only clear the way.\n\nIf you will help me light the sacred braziers, Tu'whacca will send his Breath to help us destroy the Withered Hand and return the dead to the sand.
No. The count died years ago, and she's been in charge ever since. Of course, every eligible man in Stormhaven has come calling, trying to court her, but she doesn't like them, or hasn't married at least.\n\nPlease, can you just talk to her?
Gloria says this amulet can be used to reveal the hidden werewolves. I'm sure she can tell you more about it.
I have Mages Guild researchers already working on that problem. They're trying to discover how Faolchu originally died. \n\nIf you want to help, they're at Glenumbra Moors. The battle site where Faolchu died. The first time.
That would be perfect! If you can free Len, Suriel, and Councilor Lia, the entire town will gain confidence.\n\nLet them know we're organizing. Maybe help some of the miners, as well. Then meet me behind the inn when you're finished.
Indeed! I know she'll be interested in what you discovered. Like all members of the Mages Guild, she's always been more attracted to stuffy old books than to gold or jewels.\n\nAh well, I suppose it's time for me to move on. Farewell.
That's what I wanted to hear!\n\nIf you stand up to those greedy bastards, it will show the rest of the town that we can take back Crosswych.
A spirit? A Daedra? This is part of what must be exposed.\n\nWhatever it is, it has enslaved local villagers—calling them Rain Disciples. It taps their minds for its power. To what end I do not know, but I believe you can unmask its intentions.
Outside the gate and across the bridge. You can see the smoke and flames from a distance.\n\nBut why would you want to go there? My brother Bernard sent me to call out the King's soldiers. Why risk yourself for strangers?
Of course, but it'll take time—time Evermore doesn't have. You could go now. \n\nThey need someone like you to rally the city's defenses. After what you've accomplished here, I have no doubt you can make a difference. Will you go, wayfarer?
After the gates are unbarred, look for Serien in the fortress keep. We think he's holed up inside, studying his spellbooks.\n\nBlood for the Pact!
Let's see—a half dozen wasp gizzards. But then you would have to get to my hut on the shore to make the concoction. I left my alchemy journal there.\n\nWhen it's made, toss the mixture onto the tree outside my hut. That will rile the wasps up!
Southwest of here. Could you try to find her again?\n\nShe worries me, but I must see to the town's defense.
I heard a whisper of a sacred Dark Elf performance. Those who performed it splashed in the River of Humor. And the Dark Elves … laughed.\n\nIf you tread the dust of the tomb, will you seek the rite for me?
Grandmaster Indoril appointed his senior aide to command the Vanguard. I believe the man's name is <<1>>.\n\nKill him. That is the price of affronting the Dres.
Believe it or not, <<1>> and I are researching Argonian ruins, and the pirates are in our way. I'm sure they have plenty of loot, but that's not what we're after.\n\nIf you're interested, ask <<1>> to fill you in. He's watching the lower road.
She was a decorated soldier in the Ebonheart Pact. Now she tends to guests at the Ebony Flask. \n\nHer nightflower servants probably know her best. If you want to know how to get that bottle, talk to one.
Deep in the mine, in an ancient Companion tomb … the Reachmen shamans went into the tomb, then the clansmen used two relics to seal the entrance. Their leaders are in the tomb, but you need those relics to get in.
Find and kill Remelie, the leader of the Supernal Dreamers. That should send them fleeing back to Stormhaven.
They're appearing all across Deshaan. Even Narsis is in danger.\n\nI need to stay here and finish my investigation. If you're heading south, would you carry a message to Guard Verilu at Narsis? She needs to know what happened here.
No one knows. He takes people who enter Orkey's Hollow. Now he's taken my brother.\n\nI should stop sharpening this blade. You must go inside. I just can't.
That's why I'm coming with you, silly! I won't let anything happen to you. Promise! Besides, I have the shovel!\n\nAnyway, you keep the constructs away from me and I'll dig for the key. How's that sound?
Crush every geode you find, youngin. Start with the one in this bloody bag. That'll send my family to Sovngarde and our damned-well deserved reward!
<<1>> led the charge after the Reachmen attacked. I lost track of her in the battle and we got overrun. Get out there, ease the pressure on our troops, and look for Jardirr.
Nimalten. Thane Fjora is a brave, intelligent woman. And she has the resources to protect the rest of the Ragged Hills. Grab a guardsman when you reach the town. They'll direct you where you need to go.
She's probably on the road near the Vale of the Guardians.\n\nThere are terrible things in the woods and we're not warriors. Could you find her and make sure that she's safe?
Help? No. I don't think so. \n\nActually. My guardsmen are all tied up right now. If you're up to it, perhaps you could look into some things for me?
There's coin in it for you if you do! Let's see. Tanamo favors the tavern. Anala spars at the Fighters Guild, and Balithil was visiting the market. \n\nDon't know where Degail's gotten to. One of the others may know where she is.
Either that or there's some kind of bizzarely violent relay race going on.
Exactly! Up at the manse. He's eager to discuss all the things you'll do on your visit to Skywatch. Should be a lot of fun.\n\nEnjoy your time in the city.
Both, but look for Brother Hakam first. \n\nWith the Scroll of Return, you can get Abbot Durak back here sooner, where I hope he'll be able to put out that big fire.
Fancy yourself a sellsword, eh? Yngrel the Bloody, they call him. He's wanted from here to Markarth. If you can track him in the hills and put him down before he causes more harm, there'd be gold in it for you.
"To my dearest daughter, <<1>>. Keep this heirloom with you, and look upon it anytime you feel lost or alone. Though you insist on leaving <<2>>, I will always be with you."\n\n"-<<3>>"
blah
I don't know. When they attacked, it was a rout. We couldn't defend ourselves, but the Thalmor … it might be possible.\n\nThis is a lot to ask, but could you have a look? Maybe someone's still alive in there.
You are … most gracious. I would be grateful. \n\nYou could rescue the Orcish and Khajiiti leaders—they're all that's left of their villages. Tell them I have what we need to escape. They'll understand.
She and a few of our bravest warriors have gone ahead into the city. They're trying to stem the tide of Daedra, ease up the pressure on our troops here. If you will, Hallowed? I'm sure she'd appreciate the help.
There's a group of standing stones near the Ayleid ruins of Anga, southeast of here. The stones seem to emit magicka, enhancing the scrolls' powers.\n\nBring these scrolls there, please, and charge them among the Anga stones.
Yes! If you can get these Bramblebreach to make sense and convince them not to oppose us, the queen will be very happy.\n\nHazazi thinks it's a wild guar chase, but if you want to try, speak with their Treethane. May you have better luck than Hazazi!
Damn it. I'll work with Kazirra to contain the district. We need to keep the Arenthians out of there. You stop that ritual. Find Akkhuz-ri and do what needs to be done.
The tower, yes, the tower. We will help you with that and so much more!\n\nBut all of our eggs must be returned.
There's a cave directly beneath us. I called a spirit there to heal the Great Tree's roots, but it hasn't returned. Would you see what holds the spirit back, and aid it if you can?
I wouldn't use those words, but yes. I assure you that the Guild will amply reward you.\n\nYou'll accompany Apprentice Patraud while he treats with the Bosmer. Just let him do the talking, and we will join you shortly.
Preserving his life may be impossible at this point, but you must try. Without him, the Valenwood will rage out of control. \n\nThe only hope lies with Aranias, and with you. Go to Greenheart and follow the trail of fire to the Wilderking's throne.
Not my concern. I get paid for feathers regardless.\n\nGo talk to some of the townsfolk if you're that curious. The magistrate's the one who runs this town. Tell him I've got some more feathers coming his way!
<<1>> simply requests that you continue to sate your curious nature at the <<2>>. Discover what you can, then join him at <<3>> where you will receive further instruction.\n\nI can assure you it will not be a waste of your time, slowpaws.
Well, as it turns out, we're fresh out of parts. Rat parts, I mean. \n\nI need you to bring us the head, legs, body, and tail from four different rats, so we can combine them into an animated rodent assemblage!
My agent Copper Dariah is with him now, at the Daggerfall Mages Guild.\n\nI need you to go there. Act as my eyes and ears, and speak on my behalf. Will you do this?
All right. Well, if you ever come back to this neck of the woods, we'll kill you.\n\nI'm only joking! Wyress humor again. Go on now. May Hircine bless your hunt, wherever it may lead you.
Julianos's truth! Such ignorance is breathtaking.\n\nIf you'll help me find out what has happened to <<1>>, I will tell you all about the ruins. If he's dead, I would want to take back the wages I'd paid him, at the very least.
Yes. Sometimes victory means getting dirty, and that's quite literally true here.\n\nA passage in the sewers leads to the gatehouse. If you'll open the main gate, we can get into the garrison without having to scale the walls and lose half our men.
No idea. He went to scout around and hasn't come back yet. Maybe you could go find him.\n\nWe did learn that they're using soldiers to keep people away from Northpoint. Only the officers seem to know what's going on inside, though.
Bah! Are you trying to coddle me now too? I command you—put aside your concerns.\n\nThis isn't even going to be a real contest. Each of my soldiers can take ten of theirs, and you can take a hundred. So … can we get on with this?
I don't know. I tried to tell him that no girl can resist a man with a few scars, but that didn't seem to sway him. Unfortunately, I lost my patience after that and now he won't even come near me.\n\nIf anyone can convince him, though, it's you.
Captain Skordo leads the mission. I trust Skordo implicity, but with your help our chances of success increase a thousandfold.\n\nHead into the farmlands surrounding Northpoint and find Skordo and his team.
In all the confusion, I'm embarrassed to admit that I lost track of my brother, Dethisam. He's the town consul. Yesterday, he went to check on the townsfolk afflicted by the plague, but he's disappeared.\n\nCan you help me find my brother?
"To be a child of the Blood Matron is to forsake the Divines. If you are ready to join us, step through the portal. Otherwise, return to your city and speak to a cursed Priest of Arkay. The Blood Matron will not induct the unworthy or weak."
That's what I need you to learn.\n\nA conjurer named Kelmen Locke was present when the atronachs were first summoned. When they turned, his fellow summoners were killed. He was the only one to escape, and I fear he is in grave danger.
If only it were that simple. As Titus loses parts of himself, his connection to me is severed. I can no longer reach him with my blessing.\n\nTitus has done everything I asked of him. It is time to send him home. Will you help him remember who he is?
Hmph. Everyone's a critic. You want a challenge? Invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle before facing Canonreeve Oraneth and see how well she takes your critiques.
The rules are simple: win or die. Enter each arena, defeat all opponents, then move on to the next. \n\nSurvive them all, and I'll offer you a place in my officer corps. So—interested? Or would you rather just return to Tamriel and fight mudcrabs?
Bazrag wants to start a war, then damn it all to Oblivion, we have to stop him!\n\nHis forces are powerful enough to overwhelm the lesser clans. And he's no slouch when it comes to fighting, either. If he were to make a challenge for the throne ….
Here, I'll mark it on your map. Report to General Nesh-Tan when you arrive. She can give you a more thorough briefing.\n\nWith your help, the city will be ours soon. Three protect you.
I have no idea, but it must be important. I tried to get Sergianus, the Chief Archivist, to smuggle it out for me. But he bungled the job and got himself captured. He'll no doubt need rescuing.\n\nStart with the book though. It's in a strongbox nearby.
Here, I'll mark it on your map. Report to General Aklash when you arrive. She can give you a more thorough briefing.\n\nWith your help, the city will be ours soon. Eight protect you.
Yeah. I don't know if she sees her as competition or some sort of threat, but <<1>> also wants you to kill <<2>>. She was willing to pay extra for that. I'm all for extra pay.\n\nIf you want more details, you can ask her yourself. She's right outside.
A beast called Zandadunoz the Reborn. That name is well-earned. He just won't stay dead.\n\nThe worms have built a series of obelisks on the frontier. Examine these pillars and and kill any cultists you find. Talk to Lilyameh if you need some guidance.
"Attached are locations where the troublemakers tend to congregate, but nicking from anyone ought to stir up some healthy paranoia.\n\n"Keep what you nab, the Guildmaster only cares that the message is delivered to these laborers loud and clear."
"We've noted areas where these busybodies are sticking their noses, but fleecing anybody around there should send a message.\n\n"Finders keepers, all the Guild cares about is locals learning when to turn a blind eye."
Tsatva and his second-scale, Geel-Ma, are missing. And these wounds, these footprints … it's like they didn't even see the attack coming.\n\nTsatva-Lan and Geel-Ma must have been captured. I intend to get them out of here. Alive if possible.
Because most of what's in there is cursed, including the bits and pieces. But if you slay the toughest creature you find in there, you'll lift the curse. Probably.\n\nSo? Think you can handle it?
Just what you can carry. And be sure to find the largest Dwarven … creature? Is that the right word?\n\nDoesn't matter. Smash the toughest Dwarven creature you find in there. The siblings want to map the place once the larger dangers are handled.
You need <<z:1>> and some kind of relic to summon that many Daedra.\n\nKill the Daedra for the <<z:1>>. When you have enough, throw them on the <<z:2>> to weaken the relic. Then you can smash it, and banish them for good.
Travel north and west from Ald'ruhn and seek out the ruins near the coast. Gather whatever relics you can find from the exterior ruins and bring them back to me.\n\nAvoid the interior of the shrine, however. The place is cursed.
No, she has not. All to the good, I guess. A finless fish weakens the shoal.\n\nBut enough about me. You, my friend, are a mighty swimmer. Seek her out in her stone dwelling-place. If I know my heart, she will certainly have a task for you.
It drove my classmates mad! They were all quite sane before, but now they seem possessed by characters from novels and storybooks. They're snorting like pigs, running from cats … it's lunacy!\n\nI have some ideas on how to fix this, but I need help.
We also need to convince Sotha Sil to share the news he brought with us. But without the Ritemaster, he may decide to simply depart. Like all the members of the Dark Elf Tribunal, he can be very enigmatic.\n\nMaybe you should talk to him.
Certainly not risk my life, if that's what you're implying.\n\nYou know, you have the look of a ruffian. Want to take on the task? If you collect Niralin, or at least what's left of her, I'll make sure you're paid handsomely.
We've gotten some troubling reports of the Daedra creating cocoons. There's dozens of them now, spreading throughout the cave. We need you to destroy them.\n\nOh, and burn any sacrilegious text you find. No need for that material to remain.
No, no. A colleague of mine, Esulo, has already seen to that. He just needs some help ensuring the books are safely removed from Summerset.\n\nYou'll find him in Golden Gryphon—at the bar, no doubt.
Let me attune you to my spell. There! Now we're connected through the mental links.\n\nFind the three adventurers, Cainar, Grog, and Miriya. When you get close, the spell should send you into their individual mind traps. I can direct you from there.
Really? I have to warn you, the gryphons in there are quite nasty. They'd do anything to protect their nests from invaders.\n\nBut if you're willing, I'd be mighty grateful. Even pay you for your efforts!
First, kill the necromancer. He is a blight upon the land. \n\nThen recover the bones of the fallen Dead-Water warriors. They need to be fashioned into weapons so they can be used in battles once again. Anything less would dishonor their memories.
Just so. I made contact with a reputable salt-maker—a Nord named Hervod—who can meet our demand, but he's no butcher. He did mention that the mammoth are plentiful in The Rift this season. \n\nPerhaps you could travel there and collect both for us?
Who said anything about a direct assault? Subterfuge is called for. I suggest a small group. Slip into the palace, locate Euraxia, and remove her from the throne—by any means necessary.\n\nTalk to Gharesh-ri. He knows someone who can get us inside.
Half-sister. And I have no hesitation in this regard.\n\nTo best Euraxia, however, we need to reach the Halls of Colossus ahead of her. Give me and Khamira a moment to negotiate an accord we can both live with. Then meet us by the wagon I chartered.
I'll admit, I've never been sure of how it plays the song. Perhaps through an enchantment?\n\nI can't help but feel that we're missing something here. Something that wouldn't be clear until the mural was restored once more.
I think the best tactic is to defeat the Dragons at their hunting grounds. When they eat, we can stop them. Permanently.\n\nWhat do you say? Are you willing to help?
This one wouldn't be worth her moon-sugar as a spy if she didn't overhear a thing or two she wasn't supposed to. The great Tharn plans to meet with the Usurper Queen and he wants you to accompany him.\n\nBut you heard none of that from me.
Yes, in fact.\n\nA Goutfang adept smuggled these funeral urns out of the ruin. Wise of him, since dro-m'Athras can make puppets of the dead. But we should put them back once the Bent Cat is slain. Bad fortune to hold this sort of thing for long, yes?
Sai Sahan seemed eager to talk to you and Nahfahlaar. I'd suggest you go to Nahfahlaar's Chamber and poke your nose in.
Help me track down the coven and figure out their ultimate plan. Between the two of us, we can cover more ground and determine the full extent of this threat.\n\nAs long as the magic provided by Jorunn's wizards works as promised, that is.
Some livestock I could see. But this is unusual.\n\nNo doubt there's a drunken truth behind the story. Certainly not icy undead as Brun tells it. Would you care to look into it for me? I could pay you, obviously.
Once we enter the Scraps, we'll need to locate dormant Dwemer spiders. With my control rod, I'll command them to retrieve the power nodes for us. \n\nI'll need you to gallantly protect me from their more irritable brethren. I'd pay you for your effort.
There's an ancient Nord prison called Midnight Barrow. Our research indicates history's worst criminals were entombed there, and their spirits trapped within umbric urns.\n\nAll you need to do is smash those urns and observe the results.
Hamvir's sister was attacked by a giant insect. Even now, she lies near death as acidic poison courses through her blood.\n\nI'm on my way to Dragon Bridge to seek help, but if you're heading toward the cave by any chance, perhaps you could aid them?
The alliance leaders sponsor us to clean out the corners of their realms, so we're flush with plunder. We're using it as incentive for those who can complete contracts, conquer crypts, uh… something something with the letter c.\n\nYou in?
After you empty the rest of the True-Sworn from the villa, plant the Undaunted banner before taking on Pyroturge Encratis.\n\nHe should know just who's heading his way before you snuff him out for good.
I sure do. A cave lies to the south that my clan calls Vateshran Hollows. We hold the Vateshran's Rites there, a combat ritual meant to test our warrior's mettle.\n\nI challenge you to go there! Prove that you belong in the Reach.
With that guild of assassins, I'm not sure what to think. But Jirich is missing and I don't have enough brigadines at the ready to conduct a proper search. \n\nYou look capable. Care to earn some gold and help us determine the councilor's fate?
Untie me, please. The Silvelles will pay well if you help me get Quistley out of whatever trouble he's in, and I could use someone to watch my back. Interested?\n\nOh, and check the shack. I think Tenarei dropped something during our struggle.
Yes, when I arrived here, he had already raised many Shadowscale bodies to fight for him.\n\nIn order to spare the three I came to perform last rights upon from this fate, I must destroy their skeletons. Will you help? I can pay you for your services.
A host of scuttling Mephala-spawn invaded the vault. I don't know how, but I do know why.\n\nThey seek to take something from Dagon—a blasphemous device. We can't let either faction possess it, whatever it is. So, we destroy it. Will you help?
When you gather enough, you will be able to fashion an effigy of the Horror. Once we imbue it with energy from the Evergloam, it will allow you to lure the creature into a pocket realm. \n\nThere, you will be able to defeat it. Now go! Time is short!
I am not privy to all of Lyranth's plans. She just requested that I summon you. She's waiting in the Marbruk Outlaws Refuge. Once you present yourself, I'm sure she'll tell you everything you need to know.\n\nNow, hurry. Our world hangs in the balance.
The Unmaker is one of the strongest beings in the Deadlands. Even Dagon's Daedra go against it and lose! Plus, now it has help in the form of some Havocrel. That means abandoned armor for the picking. \n\nWe'll pay for what you retrieve. Interested?
You want to treat with it, be my guest. I left it where I found it. Outside that ruin. The Death's Valor Keep—or maybe it was the Death Valor's Keep? Doesn't matter. I won't go near it or another grave again!
Where else? She's back at Mandrake Manor, waiting for you and probably thinking up some new menial tasks to occupy my time.\n\nI love her like my own grandmother, but I can't wait to be finished with this debt!
She wants to know what you learned from the rescued captains. Compare their stories with what you and her have already discovered in your investigations.\n\nAnd she still has you on retainer, which means more gold in your pouch for your help.
Same as last time. Gold and my undying gratitude. Plus, it will help me work off my debt to Lady Arabelle.\n\nSo what do you say, my friend? Ready to assist your best partner and favorite ally again? For old time's sake?
While I help my father prepare the city's defenses, I want you to find the archdruids and secure their assistance. In exchange, they'll gain a place to protect their wounded and their seeds. Start with Archdruid Rahval of the Stonelore Circle.
Aye, and that complicates things. Y'ffelon is the Firesong stronghold. Even if we weren't still recovering from the siege of Vastyr, we'd be hard pressed to fight them on their own island.\n\nMeet us at the castle and we can discuss this.

The crumbling Dwarven fortifications of Ald Carac are said to date to the time of the War of the First Council, early in the First Era.
This quarry on the southern slopes of Red Mountain is the source of the granite being used to construct Vivec City—or it was, until the volcano awoke and began once more pouring lava down its foyadas.

The ruins of Ularradallaku are all that remains of an ancient temple complex devoted to the dread Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon.
When the new Mages Guild needed a headquarters, they took over an older Ayleid district adjacent to Imperial City and rebuilt its interior as the Arcane University. Though the Worm Cult had taken it over, it was still badly damaged by Molag Bal's attack during the Planemeld.

In Ayleidoon, the lost language of the Wild Elves, Eld Angavar means "old ironwood." Perhaps the Ayleids hoped such a name would grant permanence to this strange site between worlds. If so, it seems to have worked.

Tripping Wire Trap
Trap
This is an interesting read! It's as much a comment on the history of the time as well as an insight into what these Elves valued in their weaponry.
Amazing! The craftsmanship of this metal spine allows it to move almost as well as an animal's spine. But, which animal? Pretty remarkable that a race that constantly recoiled from messy mortality used natural structures in their designs!
Ah, precious aetherium! These gems might provide some form of vision, perhaps serving as lenses in a farseeing device? Certainly not meant for a person of Dwarven scale. These probably belonged to a vamidium or other large animunculus.
This is a treat! An Ayleid map of the Shadowfen region from very early in the First Era. The rendering of Stormhold looks almost aspirational. Several marks on here imply they had planned several locations for settlement.
A twisted strand of Dwarven metal, marked with Dwemer notches signifying power. By itself, the piece has no purpose. But joined with other pieces--braided together into a neck-ring, perhaps--this strand would vastly boost the strength of the whole.
Typically, a gorget would sit closer to the throat and fully encompass the neck. This wide scoop would offer limited protection from anything other than arrows deflected upward after striking the carapace. It would provide ample room for a bulky helmet.
Some kind of religious scourge. Used for self-flagellation no doubt. Mauloch's jawbone, this tool is ancient. The Daedric script here--see how it gives way to these more geometric runes? What were these Dark Elves punishing themselves for?
Interesting design here, it's made for a Khajiit face certainly but it doesn't look all that well constructed. There are inadequacies there that can't be attributed to just time.
Appears to be some kind of wand. Beech or Hickory, I think. So plain in appearance that some might use it in a game of fetch with the family dog. But I'd advise against that. There's a powerful magic at its core.
I've seen a few weathered mosaics depicting a feather like this alongside strange Aldmeri triremes, but I've never seen the genuine article. Looks like some kind of meteoric substance to me, but the color's unique. Gabrielle can probably speak to that.
No great mystery who this belonged to. Every Breton knows those motifs! It's a throne of House Spenard. Good riddance to poor sovereigns! Rivenspire's suffered more than its fair share of despots, but the Spenards put the others to shame.
I find it difficult to believe that even multiple layers of toughened leather could provide much resistance to puncture, but Ugron assures me that well-made hide armor can dissipate the power of a thrust or arrow surprisingly well.
I have never seen a Reach witch without a staff. I wonder if there is a correlation between the type of wood used to fashion a staff and the elemental energy it channels. Is it the shape or the substance that dictates a staff's magical properties?
This metal band is too thin to be a ring on its own. I'd say it's the inner loop of a larger ring--a signet maybe. There's an engraving here. Looks like an Elven name to me, but the styling's too angular for merish work.
Polished onyx stones cut in the High Rock style. They're too small to serve as the centerpiece of a ring or necklace, but maybe accent stones? Yeah. See the prong-scratches? I bet they flanked a larger precious stone--or even a signet.
Look at the precision here. These hinges seem impossibly small, but they open as easily as a well-greased tavern door. I can't even begin to imagine the tools required for making something like this.
The Akaviri's style of armorsmithing changed the Imperial legions irrevocably. It took a great deal of time, of course, but no one can dispute their influence.
I'd be curious to know the kind of material the ancient Akaviri fashioned their daggers out of. Shame the author doesn't specify.
The Akaviri were certainly not the first to go light on the legs when it comes to armor, but it seems to have surprised our dear author. I shudder to think of what kind of stiff plate armor the Imperials had to walk around in at the time.
Ugh, what a mess. Looks like a whole family of moths ate their fill of this tapestry scrap. We might be able to fix it. It will take a lot of patience and creativity, though.
I have never seen something quite like this. Clearly it's the shin-piece from sabatons of the highest quality, but I'm not sure it's even steel. I think these overlapping scale-like bits might be dragonhide!
I unearthed a lot of Breton archery tools outside the Crypt of Hearts, but I can't be sure I found anything like what this book describes. There was a drawing on the lower half of the page, but it didn't survive the perils of time.
I had to carefully wipe the dirt off these pages before I could make out the words. Whoever buried this book, did it with purpose. I can barely move it without releasing dirt onto my reading table.
Indeed. Only a cartographer in service to the First Empire of the Nords would draft such a map. I'd date this to around the year 400 in the First Era.
Yes, this seems quite old. Modern maps of the region evince High Elf influence. Remember, the Dominion has tried to influence Greenshade both culturally and architecturally. This map seems to predate their concerted attempts to do so.
Some of the oldest wooden relics on Summerset have a similar appearance. If they managed to turn something utilitarian like a boat into a magnificent object like this ... well, I would hate to be a woodworker looking at this.
They likely gathered it from the bottom of the sea—from shipwrecks and the like. Maormer that strayed too close. Maybe even Yokudans or Lefthanded Elves. Even so, this metal feels lighter than most. Buoyant even.
The shape is a little vague, but these almost seem like the soles of shoes to me. They would be the right length for an Altmer foot, if we're going with the theory that this is Snow Elf in origin. I suppose it could just as easily be a cooking utensil.
Common quartz, yes, but not in the context of this magical torc. Quartz is a crystal, and crystals possess many unusual qualities regarding the transmission of sound. To carve or shape this stone might have ruined its natural resonance. Or so I guess.
It depends on the clan. There's ample evidence of harmony between Nedes and Orcs in Craglorn. But you're right—clans in Stormhaven tended to take a more offensive posture against non-Orc neighbors and each other. We hadn't learned the value of unity yet.
Let's not sidestep the obvious, Reginus. This clearly hung from the snout of an ancient minotaur. It displays a level of craftsmanship we don't typically see in Minotaur attire, though. And what are these etchings. Clasped hands?
Look at the position of the neck. It seems to be looking up, to me. Fishermen in Anvil swear that broken statues rest at the bottom of the pond under the famous mermaid. Could something or someone be looking up at her? I'd check, but I can't swim!
The Thrassian Plague came down along trade routes in Elsweyr. It's likely they didn't have any means to combat it, and even once they started, by then it was already too late. This may have been an early attempt at protection.
Old Elves and their crazy magic. It reminds me of a pestle of some kind. For dipping, stirring, or crushing. I hear the Psijics can read water. Some kind of powerful augury based on watching ripples. Maybe they make the ripples with this?
The shapes featured in his panoply definitely match some of the pieces in the Gwylim First Council collection. Bit more conservative than I'd expect, though. I always had the sense that Chimer armor favored form over function. More exposed skin, etc.
Undoubtedly. The Alessian collapse struck High Rock harder than most, given the Bretons' natural stubbornness and distaste for a unified governing structure. Warring fiefs sprung up all over the peninsula in the centuries that followed.
There was a species of long-legged swamp wolves that went extinct in the 2E 10s. Lost huge numbers during the Great Burn and never recovered. You see a few of their features in the Blackwood dire wolf, though. Must have crossbred a bit.
I think this is made of morpholith! It's a very rare mineral and usually only found in pocket realms of Oblivion. They can only be harvested by Daedra! Most of the time the mineral is unstable, but somehow this one isn't. At least ... I think.
I find the entire Sinistral Mer narrative unconvincing. Lefthanded Elves? What does that even mean? In any case, yes, the Chrysocollas were not just a sign of royalty, but also a symbol of invincibility in battle. Oft enchanted, or so I've read.
Warlike? No, cursed! The connection is clear: the brooch is the emblem of a family whose lords are werewolves. The Jurgalds ruled Lower Yorgrim for centuries, and they embraced Hircine's curse. Could this be the cloak-clasp of a Jurgald thane?
I have to disagree, Amalien. The ship portrayed on one side exhibits a later art style, as does the lettering on the other. I'd say more like early 2E given the lettering style alone. I know that disappoints you, but I do know my engraving history.
Don't be dense! Look at the contours of the face, and this salt-glazing technique! You're just being contrary. The residue inside looks green and flaky--perhaps the ashy remains of some seaweed they find particularly aromatic. I bet it smelled terrible!
Molag Bal practices all sorts of bizarre alchemy in his Vile Laboratory. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to pry some facet of Mephala's realm into his own. Corrupting the essence of another Prince would be difficult, but not impossible.
Really makes you wonder--what threat did Dagoth pose to the Tribunal? I try to avoid Dark Elf politics, personally, but to wipe all mention of the Sixth House from the record seems excessive to the point of suspicious.
A coffer? Come on! The Dwarves would never use a device like this for something so prosaic! This is a testing device--a puzzle. And judging by the number of pinions, cylinders, and junction-points, I'd say it's a test none of us are likely to pass.
The lack of stars on the relic itself doesn't necessarily mean it didn't feature stars in another way. The oil reservoir has a layer of crystalline build-up--some kind of meteoric fuel, I bet. The light this lamp shed probably resembled starlight!
Regius is right about this map, the focus on waterways shows a sailor's eye. See how the Snake Tail River opens into marshlands instead of carrying on to the Niben itself? That might date the map between the flood of 2E 218 and the Crow's Storm of 2E 255.
The shape is a curiosity. Uneven, for certain, but I noticed one side is smooth. This could be for any number of reasons, but I think the most reasonable is that it was fixed against something once. A necklace, maybe? A ring?
Note the curvature of the horns. This twisting slope corresponds with Tertia Gallus's heretical renderings of Belharza from 1E 1300s. This distinctive horn shape is one of the only aesthetic features that sets him apart from his famous father.
Well, whatever this was it clearly wasn't meant to be worn by a Faun Lord themself. These markings might have more power to them than just a good warning if someone went to the trouble to sew them into fabric.

By Nalana, Advisor to House Tamrith\n\nI have been tasked with learning everything that I can about the bloodfiends that have been appearing throughout Rivenspire of late. These creatures appear to be exactly the same as other bloodfiends we have examined in the past. But for all their similarities, they have one telling and significant difference—they appear at the beginning of the vampiric cycle instead of at the end. \n\nInstead of appearing at the end of an otherwise long and grueling vampiric gestation period, this process changes ordinary citizens into feral monsters in a frighteningly short amount of time. It's almost like a fevered blood affliction that burns through individuals at an alarming rate. While not everyone who comes in contact with the catalyst becomes afflicted, those who do either turn into a vampire (rarely) or quickly spiral into the frenzied madness that characterizes all bloodfiends (the most likely outcome).\n\nMy investigations suggest that these bloodfiends have a connection to the Argonian Reezal-Jul and Lady Lleraya Montclair. The court magician of House Montclair and the daughter of Baron Wylon Montclair have been leading Montclair troops across Rivenspire—troops that include vampires. There have been rumors of a blood-curse, some sort of foul magic that allows Reezal-Jul and Lleraya to turn ordinary citizens into bloodfiends with nothing but a glance, a wave of a hand, and a few muttered words. Eyewitness reports have been confused, at best, and these claims have yet to be fully verified. \n\nAs with other bloodfiends dealt with in the past, the Rivenspire bloodfiends are vampires that have gone insane. Their minds have degraded beyond recovery, and they attack anything that moves with no regard for their own wellbeing. They are feral, violent creatures driven by their carnal lust for bones and blood. This strain of the blood-curse runs its course at an alarmingly rapid pace. I have documented instances of citizens being afflicted and turning feral in mere moments. How Reezal-Jul and Lleraya came by this terrible power is unknown. What is known is that they seem to be Oblivion-bent on helping Baron Montclair conquer the entirety of Rivenspire.\n\nThis unusual blood-curse notwithstanding, the bloodfiends operate as all others of their ilk. These wild, ferocious savages can and often do pass their affliction on to their victims. Anyone wounded or killed by a Rivenspire bloodfiend has a significant chance of becoming a bloodfiend, and in a remarkably short period of time. \n\nUntil I can gather more information, I can only recommend one course of action concerning the bloodfiends of Rivenspire—they must be destroyed.
The feeble Lion Guard has left yet another fort abandoned and ripe for plunder. This one, called Cryptwatch Fort, is located near Crosswych. Your orders are simple: find the fort and turn it into a base of operations for the Red Rooks.\n\nWhat could be better than a fort we can move right into? It will help us further establish our presence in King's Guard, and it will provide another layer of protection in case the Bloodthorn Cult turns against us.\n\nAlso, prepare for a meeting with Valenwe and her entourage. It would be good to add their unique skills to our cause.
Our scouts have located another potential hideout—though Hildune's secret refuge isn't much of a secret anymore. \n\nHildune was spotted going into his well. Instead of coming out wet, he emerged with mined materials. Our scouts convinced Hildune to go away and never return. A search of the well showed us that Hildune discovered a long-abandoned mine. Now that mine is ours.\n\nFollow Aelma inside and secure this area. With every site we take, Northpoint grinds ever tighter between a rock and a hard place.

By Headmaster Tanion of the College of Aldmeri Propriety\n\nSome of our Bosmeri and Khajiiti students have come under a misapprehension, repeating the canard that not all the Altmer of Summerset are united behind our glorious Queen Ayrenn. Nothing could be further from the truth! We High Elves have a penchant for witticisms and wordplay that can sometimes be misinterpreted by those newly-exposed to our ancient and refined culture. To set the matter straight I've assembled this brief introduction to our beloved Queen of Alinor, intending to tell her story in a simple, direct fashion that can be understood even by our new allies in the Aldmeri Dominion.\n\nThe Altmer, of course, are descended in an unbroken line from the Divines who created Nirn, and none more so than the royal family of Alinor. Ayrenn's father, King Hidellith of august memory, ruled the Summerset Isles long and well, and exemplified the best traditions of Elven Ceremoniarchy, basing his every decision on the precedents laid down in the Scrolls of Praxis. \n\nIn due time, as ordained by the Scrolls, King Hidellith and his wife Kinlady Tuinden conceived a child, who was named Ayrenn as the Praxis dictated. Princess Ayrenn was born on the 5th of Second Seed in the year 555 of the Second Era—a very auspicious date, though I will spare you the reasons why, as you lack the context to comprehend its full significance. However, you can believe me when I tell you all Summerset, Auridon, and Artaeum celebrated her birth for fifty-five days. \n\nIt was foretold that Princess Ayrenn would reflect the restless and turbulent times in which she was born, and so it came to pass. Nimble and quick-witted, she was quick to master the lessons of her tutors, and from an early age often adopted unorthodox approaches to schoolwork. In fact, she sometimes became so engrossed in her independent studies that her whereabouts were unknown for days at a time. She would often return from these field trips with unusual knowledge and display remarkable new skills.\n\nOne day in Evening Star of the year 573 the entire royal family of Alinor gathered at the Crystal Tower to celebrate Ayrenn's matriculation to the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth, where she was to study Altmeri Regal Praxis and Ceremoniarchy for the requisite 3,555 days. But Ayrenn didn't arrive—somewhere between the Palace and Tower the princess disappeared, and despite a 17th Degree Inquiry by the Justiciars, she was nowhere to be found. The Sapiarchs, however, reported that the night of her disappearance was filled with signs and portents: the constellation of the Lady seeming to ride the constellation of the Steed, the Great Orrery spun backward, and a young eaglet was found atop the statue of Topal the Explorer.\n\nIn due course Prince Naemon, Ayrenn's eldest brother, was named heir to the throne of Alinor, and in 575 he matriculated into the Labyrinth. Naemon, like his father, was a natural ceremoniarch, who seemed to have a genuine relish for the rites and duties ordained by tradition for the heir. Indeed, when King Hidellith ascended to Aetherius in the year 580, Prince Naemon immediately began preparing to speak the eighty-eight day Coronation Liturgy that would elevate him to the throne in his father's place.\n\nThen, on a day unheralded, the unforeseen occurred! Word came from Port Velyn on the continent that Princess Ayrenn was on her way to Auridon by swan ship! In wonder and haste, the Court of Alinor took itself to Firsthold to greet her, arriving just in time to welcome her unexpected return. Princess Ayrenn announced that she was prepared, as the eldest heir, to assume the Throne of Alinor—and the High Justiciar affirmed that such was, indeed, her right. She was crowned Queen Ayrenn on the 7th of Frost Fall in the year 580.\n\nNow, some of you may have heard wild tales about Princess Ayrenn's adventures during her time away from Summerset—that she sailed as first mate with a pirate captain from Anvil, disguised herself as a Dunmer in order to read the Indigo Tomes in the vaults of Necrom, bested the Dervishes of Rihad at their own sword-dance, and even outdrank Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair of Windhelm in a mead-slamming contest. All myths and tales, I assure you, preposterous and deeply absurd. Our queen was merely away, preparing for Praxis and Ceremoniarchy in her own fashion of independent study. \n\nSince assuming the throne she has brought some innovations to the rule of our land—but this is as foretold at the time of her auspicious birth, and the Sapiarchs, one and all, have endorsed her modernizations. So you see, students, Ayrenn is undisputed Queen of these Isles, and all is right and proper—as it should be.
The Snow Elf and the Variation-Lens\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nMzulchond the Tonal Architect had spent twenty years attuning the great animus geode he'd found in Inner Duathand, trying to synchronize it with the precession of the dual equinoxes in order to captivate the Nirnpith Essence. The geode's vibratory affinities continued to elude him, however, so one day he threw down his attenuators, left his workshop, and went to the kitchens for an infusion of chal. \n\nAs he approached the kitchen portal he heard sibilant music that cut off abruptly as he stepped over the threshold. His house-assistant, a Snow Elf maiden named Lilyarel, withdrew her hands from behind the steam-grill and looked up guiltily. \n\n"I heard music, Lilyarel," Mzulchond said. "What did you just put behind the calorefactor?"\n\n"It's nothing, Sir Dwarf," the maiden replied. "Just something I cobbled together to pass the time."\n\n"What? Have you been in my device-closet again? Show me what you have there."\n\nReluctantly, the Snow Elf reached behind the steam-grill and drew out a fist-sized object of golden metal, crystal knobs glinting on its flange-hood. Mzulchond held out his hand, open, and Lilyarel carefully placed the object in it. "Don't drop it," she said. "It'll get de-tuned."\n\n"Well, well," the engineer said. "So you've built yourself a crude tonal variation-lens. Is this what was playing the music I heard?"\n\n"Yes, Sir Dwarf," the maiden said, gazing at the floor. "I hope I didn't do anything wrong."\n\n"What, with this device? There's nothing dangerous in a melodic repeater bauble, so long as it doesn't leak bthun-waves from its volumizer. Can't have that—might interfere with the static condensers."\n\n"Oh, don't worry, I used arkoid shielding—not very much!" she said anxiously. "But it's not a melodic repeater, Sir, it harmonizes with my mental melodies." \n\n"Nonsense," Mzulchond scoffed. "No one knows how to synchronize a variation-lens with mental concept-cycles. It's never been done."\n\n"I wouldn't know anything about that, Sir Dwarf," Lilyarel said, wringing her hands nervously. "I just flipped the duum-emitter so it canceled the demi-ektar-waves, and it worked just fine. Can I have it back now?"\n\n"Hold on a dzum," the engineer said, raising a hand while he looked more closely at the gleaming device. "Flipping the duum-emitter cancels the demi-ektars? Yes … yes, I can see how that might work. This may be just the thing I need to attune my animus geode to the Nirnpith Essence!"\n\nAs Mzulchond turned in excitement to take the variation-lens back to his workshop, the Elf maiden picked up a flipper-strut with both hands and struck him across the back of the head. The tonal architect fell dead to the ground, as Lilyarel picked up her shiny device. "Never liked him," she hissed to herself. "Always smelled like Dwemer oil."\n\nThen she opened the brazen louvers of a vent-tube, crawled in, and began lowering herself down through the inwards of the Dwarven city. "Guess I'm going down to join the Undermer, and not coming back." And with that, she turned on her variation-lens, which immediately began harmonizing with her mental melodies.
On the Utility of Marbles and Needles\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nA Nord, a Chimer, and a Dwemer walked into a cornerclub. \n\n"What'll it be, muthseras?" the barkeep asked. \n\n"Give me a mug of mead," said the Nord. \n\n"I'll have a snifter of shein—the good stuff, mind you," said the Chimer. \n\n"Kindly serve me an infusion of chal, a marble, and a leather-sewing needle," said the Dwemer. \n\n"Haw, haw," guffawed the Nord. "Shor's bones! The little milk-drinker's going to play pick-up-sticks, but he can handle only one stick!"\n\n"At least I don't swear by a god who is not only imaginary, but dead," said the Dwemer, as the barkeep placed his items on the counter. \n\n"Hey! What?" the Nord blustered. "Why, I ought to…!"\n\n"He's got you there, by Azura's Star," said the Chimer, sipping at his shein. "A point for you, Dwarf."\n\n"On the other hand, at least the Nord doesn't think it's clever to worship demons from other planes," said the Dwemer, swirling his chal. \n\n"Boethiah and Mephala! You go too far!" cried the Chimer, drawing a triangular dagger. \n\n"Yeah! Let's gut the runt!" growled the Nord, pulling a hand-axe. \n\nThe Dwemer knocked the marble off the counter. It landed on the floor just where the Chimer was putting down his foot for his thrust. He slipped, lurched left, and buried his dagger to the hilt in the surprised Nord's chest. Meanwhile the Dwemer gave the big needle a precise flick of the finger; it spun down and lodged in a crack between the floor-planks, point up. As the Chimer back-pedaled from the dying Nord, he lost his balance and fell headfirst to the floor, where the needle pierced one of his golden eyes all the way into his brain. It took several minutes of flailing, but eventually the Chimer was as dead as the Nord. \n\nThe Dwemer pulled a coin-purse from the Chimer's belt and gave it to the barkeep, swallowed the Nord's mead in one prolonged chug, picked up the snifter of shein and took a sip, then nodded to the barkeep and left the cornerclub, snifter in hand. "Off to the market," they heard him say. "I must get a bone-tweezer, a guar egg, and a boot-jack."
The following are notes gathered, over the past centuries, of items of unimaginable significance. All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout Tamriel. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n\nBoots of the Apostle\n\nThe Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.\n\nBow of Shadows\n\nLegend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin, Dram, once wielded this bow.\n\nChrysamere\n\nThe Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.\n\nCuirass of the Savior's Hide\n\nAnother of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine awarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.\n\nDaedric Scourge\n\nThe Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of darkness back into Oblivion. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion.\n\nDenstagmer's Ring\n\nAll that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.\n\nEbony Mail\n\nThe Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.\n\nEleidon's Ward\n\nEleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eleidon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.\n\nFang of Haynekhtnamet\n\nBlack Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent Dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took seven days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.\n\nFists of Randagulf\n\nRandagulf of the Begalin clan goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.\n\nGoldbrand\n\nThis magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient Dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the Dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do flame damage to an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.\n\nHelm of Oreyn Bearclaw\n\nOne of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearer's agility and endurance.
Divayth Fyr was not easy to reach, and he was reluctant to share with Morian Zenas the secret Door to Oblivion. Fortunately, my master's knowledge of lore impressed Fyr, and he taught him the way. I would be breaking my promise to Zenas and Fyr to explain the procedure here, and I would not divulge it even if I could. If there is dangerous knowledge to be had, that is it, but I do not reveal too much by saying Fyr's scheme relied on exploiting a series of portals to various realms created by a Telvanni wizard long missing and presumed dead. Against the disadvantage of this limited number of access points, we weighed the relative reliability and security of passage, and we considered ourselves fortunate in our informant.\n\nMorian Zenas then left this world to begin his exploration. I stayed at the library to transcribe his information and help him with any research he needed.\n\n"Dust," he whispered to me on the first day of his voyage. Despite the inherent dreariness of the word, I could hear his excitement in his voice, echoing in my mind. "I can see from one end of the world to the other in a million shades of gray. There is no sky or ground or air, only particles, floating, falling, whirling about me. I must levitate and breathe by magical means …."\n\nZenas explored the nebulous land for some time, encountering vaporous creatures and palaces of smoke. Though he never met the Daedric Prince, we concluded that he was in Ashpit, said to be the home of Malacath, where anguish, betrayal, and broken promises filled the bitter air like ash.\n\n"The sky is on fire," I heard him say as he moved on to the next realm. "The ground is sludge, but traversable. I see blackened ruins all around me, like a war was fought here in the distant past. The air is freezing. I cast blooms of warmth all around me, but it still feels like daggers of ice stabbing me in all directions."\n\nThis was Coldharbour, where Molag Bal was the realm's Daedric Prince. It appeared to Zenas as if it were a future Nirn governed under the Lord of Brutality: desolate and barren, filled with suffering. I could hear Morian Zenas weep at the images he saw and shiver at the sight of the Imperial Palace, spattered with blood and excrement.\n\n"Too much beauty," Zenas gasped when he went to the next realm. "I am half blind. I see flowers and waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is Moonshadow, where Azura dwells."\n\nZenas was right, and astonishingly, he even had audience with the Queen of Dusk and Dawn in her rose palace. She listened to his tale with a smile and foretold to him the coming of the Nerevarine. My master found Moonshadow so lovely, he wished to stay there, half-blind, forever, but he knew he must move on and complete his journey of discovery.\n\n"I am in a storm," he told me as he entered the next realm. He described the landscape of dark twisted trees, howling spirits, and billowing mist, and I thought he might have entered the Deadlands of Mehrunes Dagon. But then he said quickly, "No, I am no longer in a forest. There was a flash of lightning, and now I am on a ship. The mast is tattered. The crew is slaughtered. Something is coming through the waves … oh, gods! Wait, now, I am in a dank dungeon, in a cell …."\n\nHe was not in the Deadlands, but Quagmire, the nightmare realm of Vaermina. Every few minutes, there was a flash of lightning and reality shifted, always to something more horrible and horrifying. A dark castle one moment, a den of ravening beasts the next, a moonlit swamp, a coffin where he was buried alive. Fear got the better of my master, and he quickly passed to the next realm.\n\nI heard him laugh, "I feel like I'm home now."\n\nMorian Zenas described to me an endless library, shelves stretching on in every direction, stacks on top of stacks. Pages floated on a mystical wind that he could not feel. Every book had a black cover with no title. He could see no one, but felt the presence of ghosts moving through the stacks, rifling through books, ever searching.\n\nIt was Apocrypha, the home of Hermaeus Mora, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. I felt a shudder in my mind, but I could not tell if it was my master's or mine.\n\nMorian Zenas never traveled to another realm that I know of.\n\nThroughout his visits to the first four realms, my master spoke to me constantly. Upon entering the Apocrypha, he became quieter, as he was lured into the world of research and study, the passions that had controlled his heart while on Nirn. I would frantically try to call to him, but he closed his mind to me.\n\nThen he would whisper, "This cannot be …."\n\n"No one would ever guess the truth …."\n\n"I must learn more …."\n\n"I see the world, a last illusion's shimmer, it is crumbling all around us …."\n\nI would cry back to him, begging him to tell me what was happening, what he was seeing, what he was learning. I even tried using Conjuration to summon him as if he were a Daedra himself, but he refused to leave. Morian Zenas was lost.\n\nI last received a whisper from him six months ago. Before then, it had been five years, and three before that. His thoughts are no longer intelligible in any language. Perhaps he is still in Apocrypha, lost but happy, in a trap he refuses to escape.\n\nI would save him if I could.\n\nI would silence his whispers if I could.
All she saw was the glint of moonlight in a straight, sharp line flashing into the man beside her. He groaned and slipped to his knees, falling sideways onto the ground.\n\n"By the Eight," Lormingga whispered in horror. A scaled hand clamped across her mouth, preventing her from saying anything more.\n\n"It's over," a voice rasped softly. A soft cloud of ash filled the air and she coughed, wondering why the assassin hadn't killed her, too.\n\nWhen the dust settled, Lormingga realized she was alone. Only the smear of blood on the floor beside her indicated where her companion had fallen. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, Lormingga looked around carefully. Alone. She lifted her unbound hands to her face and prayed.\n\n"Kyne, my goddess and guide, I thank you for saving me from the lizard-folk," she said softly. "We must return them to their masters."\n\n"And for that, you must pay."\n\nLormingga felt the blade slipping through her flesh before she saw the Argonian rise beside her. Her mouth moved soundlessly and her hands clutched at where the weapon had pierced her throat.\n\n"I had no proof you were involved, woman," the Argonian said, wiping her blade on  Lormingga's shirt before sheathing it. "Thanks for admitting your guilt before I left. This journey would've been inconvenient for another Shadowscale to take so soon."\n\nAs Lormingga sank to the floor, the Shadowscale assassin added, "We are all part of the Pact now … except for traitors like you."\n\nAnd then the assassin, like Lormingga's life, was gone.
A shallow pool is all I ask\nWater for roots\nMist and shadow\nLeaves lifting toward the sky\n\nGentle rain is all I need\nCloak of night\nWarmth and rain\nMurmurs in the darkness\n\nA shallow pool is all I want\nMemories held\nOld stories told\nSurrounded by children\nWho call me their Hist
By Vilyn Girith\n\nTo my son, whose inability to remember even these simple facts embarrasses our family at every opportunity. This is to inform you of the words the great houses of Vvardenfell live and breathe by, and the saints they hold as their patrons, representative of their goals and motives. If you ever again confuse the Hlaalu and Dres merchant nobles with whom we trade, I will disown you three and ten times, and once again to make the deed final and eternal.\n\nHouse Redoran: "A Redoran is a warrior whose duty is first to the Tribunal, second to House Redoran, and third to family and clan."\n\n-	Saint Nerevar the Captain is the patron saint of House Redoran. \n\nHouse Indoril: "Justice knows no sleep: Indoril shall order, the Temple shall judge."\n\n-	Saint Olms the Just is the patron saint of House Indoril. \n\nHouse Hlaalu: "To trade fairly and freely is to honor the Three."\n\n-	Saint Veloth the Pilgrim is the patron saint of House Hlaalu. \n\nHouse Dres: "To spread culture and truth to the benighted: this is our commitment and burden."\n\n-	Saint Llothis the Pious is the patron saint of House Dres. \n\nHouse Telvanni: "The forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors."\n\n-	Saint Vorys the Immolant is the patron saint of House Telvanni. \n\nYou will likely not note the lack of an ascribed motto to the sixth house, the shadow house, house Dagoth. This is because that house is extinct, destroyed at the Battle of Red Mountain, after which the remaining Houses built the Temple to the Tribunal. If you ever mention this house in polite company, I will disown you. \n\nYou will note that twice, now, I have threatened to disown you. This is because my hands are not so black as Mephala's or Lord Vivec's. My heart is too weak to simply remove you from my family.\n\nKeep this text on you at all times, and let it shame you for every reference you make to it in your dealings with our nobility. Spare our lineage the greater shame of your own foolishness. May I never have cause to call you s'wit in public again.
To Those Who Serve,\n\nAt last, our time has come. The location of the Spinner's Shrine has been uncovered, and only a handful of mindless brutes stand before us and Her triumph.\n\nYou are called therefore to join your fellows of the Web to convene beneath the valley northwest of Iliath Temple.\n\nTravel with caution. Ashlanders assault the temple, and they will not hesitate to attack any outsiders.\n\n— Vila Theran, The Widow
By Denskar\n\nBeen thinking about our fight against the Akaviri. I've got opinions. Think I'll write them down. \n\nThe whole damned war could have been avoided if those idiots in Windhelm had the sense to throw the Snakes back into the sea. Shor take them!\n\nStill wish Jorunn had moved to reinforce Windhelm. Lost some good men that day.\n\nJorunn fortified Riften, but the Snakes rolled right past. Why go straight to the Ashlands?\n\nThe fighting south of Riften, north of Fort Virak, isn't given enough respect. Those men were pinned and outmanned, and still they held.\n\nWulfharth was the only reason the men kept fighting that day. Jorunn was just a pup. He couldn't rally a mead hall.\n\nThe Snakes push into Stonefalls after the fall of Fort Virak. Why? What were they after?\n\nHeard rumors some of the Dark Elves turned their blades on the Shellbacks at first. Couldn't stand the thought of being rescued by Argonians. Damned fools.\n\nShor take the whole Snake island. Let them send another tiger demon! We'll take them again!
Raynor and I are actually getting paid for this delve! That's a step up, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAfter Bthanual, who needs the Academy? We're ready for the big time! Bring on the Mages Guild!\n\nBut we really need to find something good to impress the Guild. Sometimes it feels like they're just humoring us.\n\nRaynor thinks that with the backing of the King of Skyrim, though, we have a better chance to get in. I hope he's right.
I found it! I'm sure this is the vault where the Dwemer kept all their best lore and stuff. There was even this weird crystal mechanism, but I need a key to activate it.\n\nAnd now this stupid device that Raynor gave me is really starting to act up. I don't think it's going to last long enough to get me past these constructs. I'd better find a place to hide until I can figure out what to do next.
Sing the glory of Sovngarde! Sing the story of Nurnhilde!\n			Oh queen dear, beloved of Nord and gods,\n			You stood against the Akaviri, turning back the vile invaders,\n			We wept like weans when your fair head fell,\n			But we know you watch over us from Sovngarde above!\n			Sing the glory of Sovngarde! Sing the story of Nurnhilde!\n			Weep for our beloved queen!\n\n						— Helgreir Lute-Voice, Bard of Windhelm
We lost Sergeant Marceau today. Poor Henri! The traps in the barrow finally caught him. I feel quite bad about it, even though I barely knew the man. I was about to step onto a hidden pressure plate when he noticed and pulled me out of the way, but he lost his balance and set it off himself. It was awful. And just this morning, I was having a conversation with him about how he arranges his kit. How depressing.\n\nValcent's eagerness and pride when we first got this assignment has turned into something else entirely. When he learned of this crypt, he was adamant we explore it. Henri's death didn't even phase him. He demanded we leave the poor man's body where it fell and continue our mission. \n\nI don't understand how Valcent hopes to turn the barrow's dead into an army. We were sent here to build local opposition to King Jorunn, but Valcent feels this will advance our cause in some way I can't begin to understand. I don't know what Valcent is up to.\n\nFor the moment, we're just waiting. The door to the next chamber is locked, and Owen is crafting a key to open it. I convinced Owen to make a copy of the key for me. I don't trust Valcent, and I believe in making sure there's always a contingency. That's the Covenant way.\n\nThat's why I'm hiding the key inside this journal.
Here are the empty bottles that contained Dhalen's potion. I'd recommend getting them out of town now that the elixir has been circulated. The quality of alchemical loot you can find in a Daedric ruin is just amazing! Illusion magic and poison, both in the same trove!\n\nWe've been telling everyone that it's an ancient Argonian custom, using an ancient Argonian wine. Even the Argonians, who I admit were initially suspicious, eventually took part. Everyone wants a reason to drink, right? By the Eight, one of the Nords drank eight bottles of it before stumbling off toward the river. Probably drowned himself.\n\nThe elixirs are working. People will be confused if they start seeing double, though. We need to get rid of any evidence. You know what I mean.\n\nI'm dealing with things at the barracks. It's amazing where you can go when you look like the Commander. Then I'll meet "Marla" to discuss any final details. Dhalen's done his part. Now it's our turn.\n\nFor Fildgor!
Mud clings to every step Nordahl takes. How can such a man have risen to leadership? Yes, he has the shard. But all we have is his word that he gained it through prowess. In speech and deed, he has been rash.\n\nI do not bring these concerns to you lightly, mistress. When we return to Riften, we will speak more of these matters. Perhaps you should relieve him of his shard. Or his life.\n\nUntil then, stay moist.\n\n— Scent-of-Graves
With the Kwama gone all crazy back home in Deepcrag, Mama Aralosi can't get the eggs she needs for her famous omelets. I'm going take this bag and rustle up some eggs. She'll be so pleased, I just know it.\n\nI copied Mama's recipe below, so I know what I have to get:\n\nStep 1: Find a kwama mine—Check!\nStep 2: Procure a kwama egg—Check!\nStep 3: Get out of the mine alive\nStep 4: Crack egg into a large bowl\nStep 5: Whisk until the white and yolk combine\nStep 6: Add spices to taste\nStep 7: Bake and serve
Brave Little Scrib lived with the Kwama Queen, the workers, and the warriors. They were a free colony of kwama, not bound to a Dark Elf mine or any other form of servitude. But Brave Little Scrib was bored. She didn't like being told what to do by the older kwama.\n\n"What makes you smarter than me?" Brave Little Scrib asked Kwama Worker.\n\n"I'm older than you, Scrib," Kwama Worker said impatiently, "And I'm always very busy, so I know what's best. You need to stay away from the waterfall. Trust me, you're better off keeping busy than playing in the stream."\n\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like that answer, so she went to speak with Kwama Warrior. "Why can't I play in the waterfall?" she asked.\n\nKwama Warrior, serious as always, never looked at Scrib as he spoke. Instead, he constantly scanned the cave for any potential threats that needed to be fought. Warrior liked to fight, and he was always looking for a battle. "The waterfall? You can't fight the waterfall, Little Scrib. Water is cold and fast and it makes you drown. You should go back to the egg chamber and play with the other scribs where the other warriors and I can watch over you."\n\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like that answer, either. "Well," thought Brave Little Scrib, "if no one can give me a really good reason why I can't play in the waterfall, then I'm going to go play in the waterfall."\n\nAs Brave Little Scrib approached the underground stream that flowed from the falling water, she spotted a tiny torchbug up ahead. "Hello, tiny Torchbug," Scrib called out.\n\n"Oh, hello, Little Scrib," Torchbug sang. His voice was hot and sultry, and it crackled like a burning fire. "What brings you to this part of the cave?"\n\n"I've come to play in the waterfall," Brave Little Scrib said cheerfully. "Will you fly away so I can pass?"\n\n"Oh, yes," sang Torchbug. "I'll happily fly out of your way. I haven't seen anyone drown in the waterfall in quite some time, and I find the sight very entertaining. Please, hurry. I need a good laugh."\n\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like what Torchbug was saying. "You want to see me drown?"\n\n"Well, I guess I don't really care one way or another," sang Torchbug, "but I do enjoy a good drowning. Do you know how to swim, Little Scrib?"\n\nBrave Little Scrib thought about Torchbug's song. "I know how to swim," she lied. "But I don't think I feel like playing in the waterfall today. Maybe tomorrow. See you later, Torchbug."\n\n"If you insist, Little Scrib," Torchbug sang. "Have a good day."\n\nAnd Brave Little Scrib wandered back to the egg chamber, looking for another adventure.
By The Hollow Voice\n\nThough powerful masters of necromancy can reanimate subjects long dead, most practitioners require a fresh subject. This often means most novices require a subject that has passed no more than three days prior. Attempting to raise minions without the proper knowledge of and training in the necromantic arts can result in an incomplete binding of the soul.\n\nThe subsequent breaking of the master and minion relationship can be dire for the hapless novice necromancer.

2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n2 Mid Year, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\n\n"The Imperial army is gathered to the south," said Cassyr. "They are a two week march from Ald Iuval and Lake Coronati, heavily armored."\n\nVivec nodded. Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake Ald Malak were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time. His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\n"They were heavily armored, you say?" asked the captain.\n\n"Yes, sir," said Cassyr. "They were camped out near Bethal Gray in the Heartland, and I saw nothing but Ebony, Dwarven, and Daedric armor, fine weaponry, and siege equipment."\n\n"How about spellcasters and boats?" asked Vivec.\n\n"A horde of battlemages," replied Cassyr. "But no boats."\n\n"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati," Vivec studied the map carefully. "They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south."\n\n"They'll be vulnerable along the straits," said the captain. "Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland."\n\n"Your intelligence has once again served us well," said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. "We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again."\n\n3 Mid Year, 2920\nBethal Gray, Cyrodiil\n\n"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?" asked Lord Bethal.\n\nPrince Juilek barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\n"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat," said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\n"My Prince," said Lord Bethal with concern. "Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits."\n\n"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold," said the Prince with a grin. "Let me worry about my army's direction."\n\n16 Mid Year, 2920\nLake Coronati, Morrowind\n\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor, could not move invisibly or silently.\n\n"Let me see the map again," he called to his captain. "Is there no other way they could approach?"\n\n"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and get bogged down," said the captain. "We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits."\n\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\n"Spy," said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. "When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?"\n\n"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them," explained Cassyr. "I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers."\n\n"You fool!" roared Vivec. "They're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration. They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army."\n\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, he could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\n"Return to Dwynnen," said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. "Your services are no longer needed nor wanted."\n\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army.
Dearest,\n\nI will not be in port for long, but I do have enough time to spare for a pot of a tea with these friendly Argonians and to draft a few quick letters. When the tide shifts, I will be at sea once more, pursuing those dastardly Renrijra Pirates.\n\nPerfidious Khajiit! I will pursue those pirates to the world's edge, if need be!\n\nYou embarrass me with your constant need for declarations of undying love, but rest assured that I echo your sentiments in return.\n\nLately, I have been preoccupied. The Renrijra raid our shores, trying to claim our lands as their own. I always knew cats were territorial, but those Khajiiti raiders pursue this as an obsession. Those pirates are relentless!\n\nOn the rare occasions when we capture one, it is always the same frustrating dialogue. They are quick to speak of territorial rights and political reform, and so on and so forth. But really, I know the truth. They are little more than smugglers and sea-raiders propping up their criminal activities behind a facade of ideals. They lie! And they shall pay!\n\nThey scowl, these pirates. They sneer, even when held in bonds. They take pride in their contemptuous nature. In fact, it is reflected in their very name: "Renrijra Krin." I have heard it translated as "the Mercenary's Grin" or "the Smiling Scum." The scum! It suits them well, but I prefer to call a knave a knave. They are smugglers and pirates and thieves to the last filthy cat.\n\nThe Renrijra are swaggering fools. Do you know what the so-called "code" of their order is called? "The Foolish Concepts." Fools! I have intercepted their logs and records, and I know their ways. They kill without hesitation. They espouse bravery, yet run away when confronted with justice. They curry favor by giving trinkets to the poor. Then they claim to be benefactors when stealing from those of privilege. A thief is still a thief!\n\nSuch insolence! They remind me of that servant we used to employ, the one who deigned to teach you how to dance. Do you remember him? The swarthy fellow who kept trying to meet with you privately? What cheek! Or the gardener who lurked by your bedroom window while I was away? Or the mason who would linger in our salon pretending to work while surreptitiously staring at you? Knaves! The world is full of knaves.\n\nKnow that I do this for more than my need to protect you and yours. I do this to protect our kingdom! I do this to secure our High King's domain by sea! Those knavish cats will never prevail.\n\nForgive me for my digression. My need for justice consumes me. I fear I will be at sea pursuing the Renrijra for several more months, along with the crew of the Wrath of Glenumbra, yet I await the day I shall return to you.\n\nIn answer to your last query: yes, we can afford to hire those workers you requested to build an extension on the house. Make sure they aren't shirking their duties. You'll have to watch them closely!\n\nI've nearly drained my teapot and worn out my welcome with these spiritual lizard-folk, so I must be away. Rest assured, those Renrijra Pirates won't escape the relentless efforts of the Breton Navy.\n\nI remain, as always, your affectionate and loving,\n\n—Captain Augustus Relippe, Commander, The Wrath of Glenumbra
The first of the afflicted began arriving almost immediately after the quarantine was set up. I don't know how we spread the word so quickly, but people seem to be coming from all over the region for the promised cure.\n\nI now have the opportunity to observe the afflicted through all stages of the Llodos plague. It begins with a mild fever and random bodily aches and pains. Oddly, afflicted suffering this stage of the plague have a terrible hunger that cannot seem to be satisfied. This stage of the plague lasts anywhere from three to seven days.\n\nThe second stage of the plague is marked by a high fever, overall weakness, and the appearance of open sores upon the body. Pain grips the afflicted, making most normal activities impossible to perform. During this stage of the plague, the afflicted's appetite disappears, and it is a struggle to make them eat and drink sufficient amounts of food and water to maintain their body weight. This stage of the plague can range from seven to fourteen days. If the afflicted doesn't throw off the plague during this period, chances of survival drop to almost zero.\n\nThe third stage of the plague marks the beginning of the end for the afflicted. The open sores now cover most of the afflicted's body, which burns with such heat that the afflicted becomes delirious and subject to hallucinations. The afflicted refuses to eat or drink, and any kind of movement results in agony. This stage of the plague is relatively short, lasting from one day in extreme cases to as long as five days for those unfortunate enough to hang on.\n\nThe final stage of the Llodos plague is perhaps the most fascinating. Of course, many of the afflicted simply die when the plague has run its course. And the death is extremely painful and heartbreaking to watch. But an increasing number of afflicted don't find a natural end. These unfortunates transform into seemingly undead creatures that the common folk call "plague husks." These creatures appear to be mindless engines of violence, intent on destroying all life they encounter.\n\nCan you imagine an army of such creatures? Priceless!\n\nAh, the crates of accelerant have arrived! Now we can increase the pace of the affliction. Time to treat my patients.\n\n—Nostrum Breva

Finally, the answer! In my dream, I saw the one whose strength will help me complete my quest to bring Falinesti back! Soon, very soon. Perhaps it will be Sundas again.\n\nSundas. Does the year matter? The month? We first met on a Sundas. And on a Sundas many years later, he disappeared.\n\nI took the pilgrimage to the other Falinesti Sites with the faithful. But I remembered we met on a Sundas at the Summer Site, and realized when the Walking City returns, it will be to the valley.\n\nAnd of course, I'm right. The cracks between the Summer Site and Oblivion demonstrate how close the city is. Some nights, I can see its lights shimmering through the portals that flare into existence now and then.\n\nWe'll be together soon, and the many, many years apart will mean nothing. It will be as it was that Sundas, when I first put my hand into his.

I can't believe my luck. I've stumbled across the ruins of a place called Wansalen. \n\nThe unfortunates that built the place apparently didn't make it out alive.\n\nNow, though, they all walk the halls of Wansalen again. I wonder if their souls missed this place? Stubborn skeletons, they still won't answer when I talk to them!

(The following is a transcript of the words of Lord Vivec himself.)\n\nWho can clearly recall the events of the distant past? But you have asked me to tell you, in my own words, the events surrounding the Battle of Red Mountain, the birth of the Tribunal, and the prophecies of a Nerevar reborn. Here is what I can tell you.\n\nWhen the Chimer first abandoned the herds and tents of their nomadic ancestors, and built the first Great Houses, we loved the Daedra, and worshiped them as gods. But our brethren, the Dwemer, scorned the Daedra, and mocked our foolish rituals, and preferred instead their gods of Reason and Logic. So the Chimer and Dwemer were always at bitter war, until the Nords came and invaded Resdayn. Only then did the Chimer and Dwemer put away their strife and join together to cast out the invaders.\n\nOnce the Nords were driven out, General Nerevar of the Chimer and General Dumac of the Dwemer, who had come to love and respect one another, resolved to make peace between their peoples. In that time I was but a junior counselor to Nerevar, and Nerevar's queen, Almalexia, and his other favorite counselor, Sotha Sil, always doubted that such a peace might long survive, given the bitter disputes between Chimer and Dwemer, but by negotiation and compromise, Nerevar and Dumac somehow managed to preserve a fragile peace.\n\nBut when Dagoth Ur, Lord of House Dagoth, and trusted as a friend by both Nerevar and the Dwemer, brought us proof that High Engineer Kagrenac of the Dwemer had discovered the Heart of Lorkhan, and that he had learned how to tap its powers, and was building a new god, a mockery of Chimer faith and a fearsome weapon, we all urged Nerevar to make war on the Dwarves and to destroy this threat to Chimer beliefs and security. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac and asked if what Dagoth Ur said was true. But Kagrenac took great offense, and asked whom Nerevar thought he was, that he might presume to judge the affairs of the Dwemer.\n\nNerevar was further troubled, and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, and Azura confirmed that all that Dagoth Ur said was indeed true and that the creation of a New God of the Dwemer should be prevented at all costs. When Nerevar came back and told us what the goddess had said, we felt our judgments confirmed, and again counseled him to war, chiding Nerevar for his naive trust in friendship, and reminding Nerevar of his duty to protect the faith and security of the Chimer against the impiety and dangerous ambitions of the Dwemer.\n\nThen Nerevar went back to Vvardenfell one last time, hoping that negotiations and compromise might once again preserve the peace. But this time the friends Nerevar and Dumac quarreled bitterly, and as a result, the Chimer and Dwemer went to war.\n\nThe Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but Nerevar's cunning drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and pinned them there, while Nerevar, Dagoth Ur, and a small group of companions could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar the Chimer King met Dumac the Dwarf King and they both collapsed from grievous wounds and draining magics. With Dumac fallen, and threatened by Dagoth Ur and others, Kagrenac turned his tools upon the Heart, and Nerevar said he saw Kagrenac and all his Dwemer companions at once disappear from the world. In that instant, Dwemer everywhere disappeared without a trace. But Kagrenac's tools remained, and Dagoth Ur seized them, and he carried them to Nerevar, saying, "That fool Kagrenac has destroyed his own people with these things. We should destroy them, right away, lest they fall into the wrong hands."\n\nBut Nerevar was resolved to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. "I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth Ur, until I return." So Nerevar told Dagoth Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned.\n\nThen Nerevar was carried to us where we waited on the slopes of Red Mountain, and he told us all that had transpired under Red Mountain. What Nerevar had said was that the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and that the Heart of Lorkhan held wondrous powers. Only later did we hear from others present that Dagoth Ur had thought the Dwemer destroyed, not made immortal. And no one knows for sure what really happened there.
by Anthil Morvir\n\nA One Act Play\n\nDramatis Personae:\n\nMalvasian: A High Elf battlemage\nInzoliah: A Dark Elf battlemage\nDolcettus: A Cyrodiil healer\nSchiavas: An Argonian barbarian\nA Ghost\nSome bandits\nScene: Eldenwood\n\nAs the curtain rises, we see the misty labyrinthian landscape of the legendary Elden Grove of Valenwood. All around we hear wolves howling. A bloodied reptilian figure, SCHIAVAS, breaks through the branches of one of the trees and surveys the area.\n\nSCHIAVAS: It's clear.\n\nINZOLIAH, a beautiful Dark Elf mage, climbs down from the tree, helped by the barbarian. There is the sound of footsteps nearby. Schiavas readies his sword and Inzoliah prepares to cast a spell. Nothing comes out.\n\nINZOLIAH: You're bleeding. You should have Dolcettus heal that for you.\n\nSCHIAVAS: He's still drained from all the spells he had to cast down in the caves. I'm fine. If we get out of this and no one needs it more, I'll take the last potion of healing. Where's Malvasian?\n\nMALVASIAN, a High Elf battlemage, and DOLCETTUS, a Cyrodiil healer, emerge from the tree, carrying a heavy chest between the two of them. They awkwardly try to get down from the tree, carrying their loot.\n\nMALVASIAN: Here I am, though why I'm carrying the heavy load is beyond me. I always thought that the advantage of dungeon delving with a great barbarian was that he carried all the loot.\n\nSCHIAVAS: If I carried that, my hands would be too full to fight. And tell me if I'm wrong, but not one of the three of you has enough magicka reserved to make it out of here alive. Not after you electrified and blasted all those homunculuses down below ground.\n\nDOLCETTUS: Homunculi.\n\nSCHIAVAS: Don't worry, I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do.\n\nINZOLIAH (innocently): What's that?\n\nSCHIAVAS: Kill you all and take the Ebony Mail for myself. Admit it—you thought I had that in mind.\n\nDOLCETTUS: What a perfectly horrible thought. I never thought anyone, no matter how vile and degenerate— \n\nINZOLIAH: Why not?\n\nMALVASIAN: He needs porters, like he said. He can't carry the chest and fight off the inhabitants of Elden Grove both.\n\nDOLCETTUS: By Stendarr, of all the mean, conniving, typically Argonian— \n\nINZOLIAH: And why do you need me alive?\n\nSCHIAVAS: I don't necessarily. Except that you're prettier than the other two, for a smoothskin that is. And if something comes after us, it might go for you first.\n\nThere is a noise in some bushes nearby.\n\nSCHIAVAS: Go check that out.\n\nINZOLIAH: It's probably a wolf. These woods are filled with them. You check it out.\n\nSCHIAVAS: You have a choice, Inzoliah. Go and you might live. Stay here and you definitely won't.\n\nInzoliah considers and then goes to the bushes.\n\nSCHIAVAS (to Malvasian and Dolcettus): The king of Silvenar will pay good money for the Mail, and we can divide it more nicely between three than four.\n\nINZOLIAH: You're so right.\n\nInzoliah suddenly levitates up to the top of the stage. A semi-transparent Ghost appears from the bush and rushes at the next person, who happens to be Schiavas. As the barbarian screams and thrashes at it with his sword, it levels blasts of whirling gas at him. He crumbles to the ground. It turns next to Dolcettus, the healer, and as the Ghost focuses its feasting chill on the hapless Dolcettus, Malvasian casts a ball of flame at it that causes it to vaporize into the misty air.\n\nInzoliah floats back down to the ground as Malvasian examines the bodies of Dolcettus and Schiavas, who are both white-faced from the draining power of the ghost.\n\nMALVASIAN: You had some magicka reserved after all.\n\nINZOLIAH: So did you. Are they dead?\n\nMalvasian takes the potion of healing from Dolcettus's pack.\n\nMALVASIAN: Yes. Fortunately, the potion of healing wasn't broken when he fell. Well, I guess this leaves just the two of us to collect the reward.\n\nINZOLIAH: We can't get out of this place without each other. Like it or not.\n\nThe two battlemages pick up the chest and begin plodding carefully through the undergrowth, pausing from time to time at the sound of footsteps or other eerie noises.\n\nMALVASIAN: Let me make sure I understand. You have a little bit of magicka left, so you elected to use it to make Schiavas the ghost's target, forcing me to use most of my limited reserve to destroy the creature so I wouldn't be more powerful than you. That's first-rate thinking.\n\nINZOLIAH: Thank you. It's only logical. Do you have enough power to cast any other spells?\n\nMALVASIAN: Naturally. An experienced battlemage always knows a few minor but highly effective spells for just such a trial. I take it you, too, have a few tricks up your sleeve?\n\nINZOLIAH: Of course, like you said.\n\nThey pause for a moment before continuing as a fearful wail pierces the air. When it dies away, they slowly trudge on.
It is nearly done. Lodorr is sealed in his tomb. One task remains. I must prepare a cursed ward that will cause the dead to rise if the prison is ever breached. \n\nI've ordered the tunnels sealed behind me. This shall become my tomb, as well.

… with some success. Beem-Tei discovered the hidden entrance to the Dwemer underworks; may her spirit find repose in the waters of Black Marsh. The automatons guard their masters' secrets well.\n\nThe spider and sphere guardians swarmed over us, killing Beem-Tei and Reekatul before we fought them off. The outer chamber was ours, for a time. The central heating plant and other machinery were fascinating but Ukka-Malz insisted we press farther in, searching for relics we could remove.\n\nThe inner chamber was our undoing. Spheres and spiders were the least of our worries. Our intrusion awakened a Dwemer Centurion. From the inscriptions on the walls, we were able to learn its name just before we were overwhelmed: Thzallek Eft. Ukka-Malz and the others died under its relentless assault. Only I lived to reach the exit. Thzallek Eft. The name will haunt my sleep.\n\nBut I cannot get out. The doors are locked by an unseen mechanism. Our food and water are back in the outer chamber. I'll venture there only if desperate. Perhaps other researchers will open the doors before I reach that point.
By Nuulehtel of Skywatch\n\nLoyal citizens of Auridon! I have the pleasure of being an advisor to Her Royal Majesty, Queen Ayrenn the First, Eagle Primarch of the Aldmeri Dominion, High Queen of the Summerset Isles, Overfriend of the Royal Camoran House of the Wood Elven people, and boon companion to the Mane of the Khajiit.\n\nAs Royal Advisor, I have penned this brief account of Queen Ayrenn's life and history. Read, that you might welcome our Queen into your hearts.\n\nHer Majesty spent her early days as many children do in the Isles. She trained in blades beside her father. She rode horses in the surf along our golden beaches. And she memorized history and sonnets beneath soft pink petals.\n\nOver twenty years ago, your forward-thinking King—His Royal Majesty, King Hidellith of Alinor, may he be ever honored in Aetherius—gathered with the royal family at the Crystal Tower in celebration of Her Majesty's passage into the Labyrinth. This time of intensive study had been required by all Summerset rulers in the past, and Her Majesty was to step into that period with arms wide. As the hour approached, however, the then-princess was found missing!\n\nWhile a long search was begun, in truth, Her Majesty had claimed her own destiny. Her Majesty had stolen away to the Isle of Balfiera to live with the Direnni at the Adamant Tower. The members of that clan trained her in the art of war. They turned her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and her singing of sonnets beneath the trees of her homeland gave way to the study of the arts most arcane.\n\nMuch has been made of our Queen's adventures in Tamriel by bards and common broadsheet scribes. Yes, it's true that she once rode a bear. That she hunted the frost trolls of Skyrim, delved into the depths of a Dwarven ruin, and crewed with a pirate captain of Cyrodiil. Her Majesty once flew upon an enormous kite on the winds of the Alik'r Desert, and danced with Nereids in the Illessan Hills. These adventures were not the larks of a wanton, but instead a deliberate process. The tempering of a blade!\n\nAnd when His Majesty King Hidellith passed away, when it looked as though our remote isles would be left to flounder in the swell of history, Princess Ayrenn returned! Her Majesty plucked the crown from where it had fallen in the dust. She took up her father's sword and led us out into the world.\n\nLed us into the world to find new allies waiting just off our shores! The Queen's connections to the noble Wood Elves and fierce Khajiit enabled us to form the mighty Dominion that now stands astride our corner of Tamriel, poised to strike at the dark heart of Cyrodiil and ward off the depredations of the warmongering alliances of the north.\n\nThough she has her detractors and cowards defame her courage from behind a veil, Queen Ayrenn is the living, beating heart of the Dominion. Our fortune and prosperity depend upon her.

The magically-burgeoning growths in these ruins are astounding. They snake their way through not only the walls, but out into the jungle soil. Tancano joked that they wormed through the city like a circulatory system. An apt remark, because here's the weird part: they share a pulse.

By Gaston Bellefort\n\nAlthough various works have been written on the subjects of both Morrowind's Morag Tong, and Tamriel's more widespread Dark Brotherhood, there remains confusion as to precisely when and how these two feared assassins guilds formed. Or, more specifically, when and how the Dark Brotherhood split from the Morag Tong, as the former is widely accepted to have sprung from the latter.\n \nThe largest point of contention seems to be the figure of the Night Mother, a woman who figures prominently in both organizations. Through extensive research and interviews, and not inconsiderable risk to my own life (for the Dark Brotherhood holds this information sacred), I have finally solved this ages-old mystery. I have finally uncovered the Night Mother's Truth.\n \nAlthough her name has been lost to time, the Night Mother was once a mere mortal, a Dark Elf woman who lived in a small village once located where the city of Bravil stands now, in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil. She was a respected member of the Morag Tong and, like her fellow members, this woman made her trade as an assassin in service to the Daedric Prince Mephala. In fact, the woman held the title of Night Mother, reserved for the highest ranking female member of the organization. To be Night Mother of a particular sect was to be that group's matron—the favored of Mephala, both respected and feared.\n \nHowever, it was not Mephala who facilitated the transformation from woman to spectre, but another, some would say far deeper form of evil—Sithis, the Dread Lord, embodiment of the unending Void.\n \nFollowing the Potentate's assassination in 2E 324, strife descended upon the Morag Tong, and the guild was all but eradicated in Cyrodiil and much of the Empire. It was shortly after these events that the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis himself. The Dread Lord, she claimed, was displeased. He was unhappy with the Morag Tong's lack of success. The Void, he told her, was hungry for souls—and it was her destiny to set things right.\n \nAnd so, according to Dark Brotherhood legend, Sithis visited the Night Mother in her bed chamber, and begat her five children. Two years passed, before the unthinkable happened. The Dark Elf woman followed through with the Dread Lord's ultimate plan—one night, she murdered her children, and sent their souls straight to the Void. Straight to their father.\n \nWhen they learned of this affront to decency, the people of the village rallied against the woman. For such an act was considered incomprehensible, even for a Night Mother of the Morag Tong. In one night of vengeance, they descended upon the woman, killing her, and burning down the house in which the atrocity took place. And that was the end of the story. Or so everyone thought.\n \nA little more than thirty years later, an unnamed man heard a strange, comforting voice inside his very head, just as the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis inside hers. The voice identified herself as the Night Mother, and named the man "Listener"—the first of many.\n \nAnd so the Unholy Matron set her servant on his path—he would found a new organization, a guild of assassins known as the Dark Brotherhood, in service not to Mephala, but to the Dread Lord Sithis. The Morag Tong, now surviving only in Morrowind, was an artifact of a forgotten age. The Dark Brotherhood would marry business with death. The organization would grow in wealth and power, and the Void would swell with fresh souls. It was, the Night Mother told her Listener, the perfect arrangement.\n \nIn the early days of the Dark Brotherhood, the bodies of the Night Mother and her children were recovered from their original burial site, and interred in a crypt beneath the site of her house. And there they remain, even today.\n \nSo if, in your travels, you find yourself in the city of Bravil, and make a wish at the statue of the Lucky Old Lady (as is the local custom), know that you stand on sacred, if evil, ground. For you stand above the Night Mother, the Unholy Matron herself, and your luck has just run out.
Firilia,\n\nIt's been ages. I've failed. I know it. Even now, I write this and know your eyes will never see it. \n\nI got the medicine. As promised. The one thing I ever managed to do successfully for this family. And I return only to find that Falinesti is no longer here.\n\nWould you believe me if you read this? Do you think I'm a failure even now? Did our daughter survive the illness? She wouldn't know me. Even then. I was never there for either of you. Why is it I'm not allowed to make amends? I want to make it right. I was going to make it right.

I will prevail!\n\nI will stay awake.\n\nI must not sleep.\n\nI know its name, and I will destroy it.

Bring this to the attention of Stormreeve Neidir. The following is a copy of an Altmer text regarding Tempest Island, written by esteemed geographer, Angalmo. The Island is close enough to Malabal Tor for our needs, and considering its history of bizarrely inclement weather, it's a perfect launching point for our assault. The Dominion will never see us coming:\n\nAngalmo's Travels: The Island of Storms Volume 1\n\nThe shrouded islands off the coast of Malabal Tor are as treacherous as they are beautiful. None more so than the Island of Storms, which some have come to call Tempest Island. The island is beautiful, but holds a secret that none have been able to decipher. Violent storms and gale winds have originated from the island for years—extremely unusual weather for the region—and scholars have risked its shores only to be stranded or killed on its storm-wracked coast.\n\nI have seen these storms firsthand; I was with one such expedition, and spent a month on Tempest Island when my ship, the Summerset Blade, was smashed to splinters by a black storm that seemed to appear from nowhere. I had misgivings about the stories before, but what explanation could there be besides magic to conjure such a swift tempest out of calm seas? Rescue eventually came, as a second crew of surveyors came to look for my party, but I pledged never to sail anywhere near the Island again.\n\nIt's a promise I intend to keep.
All day long in a dark, dark mine,\nSwing your pick time after time.\nThe sound of metal hitting stone,\nWe work hard, we work alone.\n\nAll day long toiling in the dark,\nHoping the next vein will hit the mark.\nA poor man dreams of golden ore,\nOur foreman screams, "Dig some more!"\n\nI keep digging and praying to the Eight,\nThat dying beneath a mountain isn't my fate.\nI'm a miner, for better or for worse,\nAnd blood, sweat, and tears won't fill my purse.

Know, O Descendant, the difficulties faced by your ancestors in their own lives. Herein follows the tale of Feremuzh. Feremuzh abandoned the tradition of her ancestors to join the unholy undead. She became a creature that degraded itself to hide from the sun and consume the blood of the living. She plagued the land, consuming life and turning the dead she created into her own followers.\n\nYour ancestors were bound to tradition—they could not lift blade against the honored dead, they could not resist the plague that Feremuzh had brought with her. The wisest of your ancestors, O reader, were gathered. In time they concluded that there was only one method to deal with the villain Feremuzh. A group of the strongest warriors would have to seek out the lair used by Feremuzh to hide from the bright Alik'r sun.\n\nThe strongest warriors were assembled, and sent forth to seek out the villain's lair. The warriors were instructed to only travel under the protection of the sun, and to hide under the moon when Feremuzh would be out to hunt. The warriors were wise to follow their elder's advice, and they remained unfound and untouched until they happened upon Feremuzh's lair.\n\nKnow, O reader, that what ensued is unclear, but what is clear is that the warriors sacrificed themselves to bring the lair down upon Feremuzh. In doing so, your ancestors trapped Feremuzh in a tomb of earth for time eternal. That earth has been deemed unholy and accursed. Know the marks of the cursed land so you may avoid it. The entrance is tucked into the base of a sharp cliffside, at the end of a path cutting through the rocks. On a bright day one can see and hear the nearby shore, but don't let the sea lull you into a false sense of security. Ruins of our ancestors watch over the cursed land. Avoid this place, and leave the damned to rot.

The Dwemer appear to have kept detailed records on all their machinery. They seemed very interested in even the most minor changes.\n\nWas this just them keeping maintenance records or could they have been looking for ways to improve their own machinery?\n\nMany of the more detailed notes are difficult to translate, but we know enough to see that a single pip was referenced twenty-three times in one day.
By Cuinur of Cloudrest, 4th Tier Scholar of Tamrielic Minutiae\n\nThis report was commissioned by the Thalmor Committee of Alliance Relations to investigate whether there might be an indoctrinal advantage to emphasizing the Ayleid lineage woven into the bloodlines of our cousins the Wood Elves. My extensive travels in Valenwood have enabled me to determine the historical facts behind the matter; whether these facts can support a useful campaign promoting alliance fellowship is up to the Committee and the Sapiarch of Indoctrination. \n\nAs Pluribel of Dusk has noted in her magisterial "Collapse of the Ayleids," blame for the White-Gold Catastrophe of 1E 243 can be attributed to a half-dozen disastrous factors, of which the bloody insurrection by indentured human laborers may not be the most important. Pluribel emphasizes, quite rightly in my belief, the Narfinsel Schism of the late Merethic Era, which pitted the more conservative Aedra-worshiping Ayleid clans against those decadent yet undeniably vigorous clans that had adopted Daedra-worship. This conflict reached its climax in 1E 198 at the Scouring of Wendelbek, when King Glinferen of Atatar led a combined force of Daedraphile warriors against the traditionalist Barsaebics of Ayleidoon. The Barsaebics were driven out of the Heartland into northwest Argonia, and thereafter organized opposition to Daedra-worship in Cyrodiil was effectively over. \n\nIn any event, by most measures Ayleid civilization had been in decline for several generations by the time the White-Gold Tower fell to the savagery of the Nedes. Standing amid the ruins of a great Elven culture, the victors concocted a justification for the blood on their hands by painting the defeated clans as vicious Daedraphiles who reveled in torture and cruelty. An exception was made for those clans, mainly Aedric adherents, who had thrown in their lot with the hordes of the Slave-Queen. Of course, this only delayed their extermination, for the barbarous Nedes inevitably came after their former allies once the other Elves of Cyrodiil had been hunted to extinction. \n\nThus began the Ayleid Diaspora, in which the Heartland Elves sought to find new homes elsewhere in Tamriel—to decidedly mixed success. Those who fled north into the lands once held by the Falmer were slaughtered by Nords led by the infamous Vrage the Butcher. The Barsaebics, by that time well established in Argonia, refused admittance to their former persecutors the Atatarics, and most of that clan died on an ill-fated expedition into the lands of the Cat-Men. Several clans set out on the long march through Hammerfell to the Iliac Bay, and some actually made it, where they joined with (and were absorbed by) the long-established Direnni of Balfiera. \n\nMost successful—and they were more than a few—were the clans that fled southwest beneath the canopy of Valenwood. The clans of Anutwyll, Vilverin, Talwinque, Bawn, and Varondo all escaped largely intact to carve out a new life under the trees. These clans all worshiped Daedric Princes, but they seem to have done so with less fervor after their enforced migration to Valenwood—possibly due to the fact that the Princes, when called upon, had offered little or no help to the forsaken clans. Fortunately their new hosts, the Bosmer, were remarkably generous in welcoming the Ayleids into their realm, so long as the Heartland Elves agreed to adopt aspects of the Green Pact and refrain from harming the forest. Having little choice, the Ayleids agreed, and this probably contributed to the dilution of their culture. \n\nFor diluted it was, absorbed over time, and eventually forgotten. I have walked the great Ayleid ruins of Valenwood—Hectahame, Rulanyil's Fall, Belarata, Laeloria, and a dozen more—and none of them, not one, was still occupied only two thousand years after the Diaspora. For some reason, once the Ayleids were under the great graht-oaks they, and their distinctive culture, simply melted away. \n\nIn explaining the extinction of the Valenwood Ayleids, my predecessor Gelgarad the Velaspid was very attached to his "Theorem of Disheritage," which held that for some reason the Forest Ayleids became unable to breed with each other and could only generate offspring by mating with the local Bosmer. This would certainly account for the Ayleids' gradual disappearance, but unfortunately Gelgarad's theorem is supported only by old stories and legends, and absent facts it cannot be proven. \n\nIt is worth mentioning here the competing theory of Doctor Thetis of the Shimmerene Academy. Her explanation blames Ayleid decline on over-consumption of the unusually potent beverages of the Bosmer. Doctor Thetis believes the Ayleids, vulnerable in their grief over their losses, fell prey to the Wood Elves' paralyzing brews and simply gave up trying. In this they may have been encouraged by the Bosmer themselves, who often seem insulted by others' displays of industrious effort.\n\nAnd what did our forest-dwelling cousins learn from the Ayleids? Precious little, apparently, other than some advanced techniques of stonework and masonry. Heartland Elven culture seems to have made little lasting impression on the culture of the Wood Elves. Their attitude seems to me summed up by the statement of Fonlor, the Yorethane of Elden Root, whose response when I asked him about the Ayleids was as follows: "The Ayleids? Oh, yes. Nice fellows. Took themselves too seriously, though, and what did it get them?"
Since the disappearance of Falinesti, there is no city that completely expresses the character and history of the Wood Elves more than Woodhearth.\n\nSituated on the southwestern shores of Valenwood, Woodhearth had humble beginnings as an Imperial settlement, constructed and maintained by the Emperors in order to facilitate trade with the region's Wood Elf settlements.\n\nThe Wood Elves of the region reacted with a mix of curiosity, friendship, and hostility to the city, which was part thriving port town and part fortress, protecting against the wilds of Valenwood.\n\nSeveral times, hostile Bosmer led assaults against the city's walls. Several times, they managed to bring down sections of the wall with concentrated bursts of powerful destruction magics, only to be driven back by the tenacity of the Imperial forces and their superior equipment.\n\nA peace was eventually struck with the Green Pact Bosmer of Valenwood, and in time a Bosmer settlement sprang up and even overtook the Imperial buildings, as that special connection the Wood Elves have with their forest was invoked to create the treehomes and walkways that are characteristic of Bosmer settlement.\n\nAs the Bosmer became an instrumental force in the Empire, control of Woodhearth was gradually ceded back to autonomous Wood Elf rule. A treethane was established in Woodhearth, and while the parts of the city that had been constructed by the Imperials fell into disrepair, the city as a whole thrived.\n\nWithin a generation, the treethanes of Woodhearth gained a reputation for determined leadership and fair judgment, among both the Wood Elves and their allies.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Treethane of Woodhearth is Fariel, and she governs both as Treethane and as a member of the Thalmor, under Queen Ayrenn of the newly-formed Aldmeri Dominion. Woodhearth continues to be a major port, along with Seaside Sanctuary, in Valenwood, and it is home to members of all races.
Tu'whacca and Burial Rites in Contemporary Redguard Culture\n\nBy Brother Opilio Congonius\n\nThe Redguards revere their departed ancestors so fervidly that it rivals the devotion many other races have for their gods. While a Breton may place a casket in ornately arched consecrated ground, or a Nord may place a wind-dried body on a shelf in a burial vault, the Redguards design and erect vast funerary structures for their dead that are as awe-inspiring as they are extensive. The thread of honor that binds the Redguards from before birth to beyond death is strong. These soaring and massive mausoleums are the purest representations of the undiluted Yokudan architecture, built to propel spirits to a meeting with their putative gods.\n\nPerhaps the finest example of this type of burial site is Tu'whacca's Throne, set atop a vast plateau in the Alik'r Desert of Hammerfell. This huge temple is dedicated to the Tricky God, the Shepherd of Souls, and the Caretaker of the Far Shores. After ascending from the desert grazing fields, up the stone stairs carved into the plateau's side, one is first struck by the incredible views from atop this flat expanse of rock and sand. After passing the Throne Keepers, who are ever vigilant and maintain Tu'whacca's Throne, the eyes meet the true majesty of this sacred place.\n\nThis necropolis is both a sprawling burial ground and a sacred ruin. Aside from Tu'whacca's presence watching from dark corners of this sanctuary, the temple also serves as a monument to the untold number of Yokudans who perished when the continent sank beneath the waves. Pilgrims travel across the stinging sands to pay their respects to these victims and to the historical Redguard kings who are also interred in this labyrinthine necropolis.
Pellus, \n\nDon't forget to lock the gate. Last time you left it unlocked a number of items went missing. My share of the loot from the Temple of Mara is here. I killed a lot of men to gain this loot and if it goes missing I'm holding you personally responsible.\n\n— Captain Accalia
Many options present themselves for the industrious necromancer who wishes to raise undead minions to serve or protect. Vengeful ghosts, of course, and other types of incorporeal spirits abound, but they have little substance and can often be difficult to control. Corporeal dead provide more muscle, which comes in handy when you need manual labor or an instant fighting force. Plus, if you use minor Daedric spirits to animate them, corporeal undead have no sense of self or memory of past lives. They are more malleable, easier to command, and capable of following simple orders. In short, they make perfect servants for most of a necromancer's minion requirements.\n\nWhile some necromancers prefer to animate zombies to perform tasks, other practitioners of dark magic prefer to deal with skeletons. First, skeletons, by definition, consist primarily of bone, with few or no organs or fleshy bits remaining. In other words, skeletons don't have the habit of dropping bits and pieces of themselves all over your ritual circle or lair, unlike their zombie counterparts. Second, skeletons tend to be more sturdy and dextrous than zombies, making them noticeably faster and, in many ways, more dangerous.\n\nYou have two sources when it comes to obtaining skeletons to raise and command. One is to pull the bones directly from a fresh corpse (or even from a living victim, if you have the appropriately powerful spell at the ready). The newly dead provide strong, sturdy bones that can deal and withstand punishment with equal facility, depending on the demands of your service. Newly dead skeletons also tend to exhibit more agility and speed, albeit with the clumsiness common to all new-born creations.\n\nThe second source to draw upon when seeking to raise skeletal minions remains the tried and true market favored by most practicing necromancers—the graveyard. Of course, any depository of the dead will do, from an ancient necropolis to a long-forgotten battleground ripe with the corpses of fallen soldiers. Older bones often house great power, and the magic you employ will gather the scattered fragments and knit them together with necrotic bindings. Older bones may crumble and shatter before the bones of the newly dead, but they often compensate for that liability with the extra power trapped within these relics and awaiting your command.
For a while, I thought that my decision to join the Red Rooks was the smartest thing I'd ever done. What farm girl hasn't dreamed of a life of adventure? And we started out with a cause and a purpose. Turmoil throughout the land had left our livelihoods shattered and our families in desperate straits. My family couldn't even afford to feed me, let alone care for my six brothers and sisters. So I left home with nothing but the clothes on my back and a rusty old sword that had belonged to my mother, and I went looking for the Red Rooks.\n\nOh, I had heard rumors about the Red Rooks. Simple trappers and farmers just like me who had enough of the high-and-mighty nobles making life impossible for the common folk of the land. They had banded together to steal from the rich and give to the poor. At least, that's what the rumors told me. I couldn't wait to join them, to live a life of action and purpose.\n\nIt wasn't hard to hook up with a band of Red Rooks, and they welcomed me into their fold well enough. They gave me a uniform, and I felt a mix of pride and embarrassment as I put it on. I guess the Red Rook leaders want us to look like an army, but I couldn't help wondering if it was such a good idea to advertise our presence in such a bold and obvious manner. But who was I to second guess those who were older and far more experienced than I?\n\nThings were going fine for a while, although it seemed like we were robbing whoever was available and keeping whatever we earned for ourselves. Still, I was a valued member of the group and I had started to develop some strong friendships—especially with Kala and Morin. We were becoming inseparable! \n\nJust when things were really looking good, I started to suspect that there was something more ominous at play than a bunch of farmers trying to be noble bandits.\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I saw our leaders meeting with those Bloodthorn maniacs. I hope we aren't really considering an alliance with the cultists. That's not what I signed on for! I want to have a little fun and earn some gold. I certainly don't want to see Glenumbra destroyed and covered in corrupted vegetation! \n\nNow I don't know what to do. Maybe I should talk to Kala and Morin. They'll know what we should do.
Exploration of the Dwarven ruins goes slowly. We were short-handed before the bandit raid. Now we have barely enough hands to keep the kwama in check. Every bit of gold we've made selling random Dwarven trinkets has gone to hiring more guards, not miners. I get that we don't want another bandit raid or construct attack. Fine. But the kwama business is falling apart while everyone plays archeologist.\n\nThe only bright spot in this whole damn thing has been the spring water in the cavern. Tastes a lot better than the swill we used to drag in from town. Maybe we should just start bottling the stuff. Since we apparently aren't egg miners anymore.
Exhilarating! The howling, the lightning—it's all energy drawn to the "Storm Totems" in that cave. But when I tried to enter, those fool Maormer collapsed the entrance!\n\nTo any Dominion personnel who find the addled skooma-smuggler with these orders, I seek another way into the cave complex. Approach if you see me about the quay so I may requisition your services in my search.\n\n— <<1>>

I can't help but think that joining the Veiled Heritance was a mistake. We're now holed up in Dread Vullain, some kind of haunted Bosmer village. While the bodies are plentiful for our work, it's disturbing to see the echoes of the past repeat themselves.\n\nThe creature that commands us was one of Prince Naemon's confidants. I spoke to him once, when both he and Naemon were still alive. It was a short conversation, of no great importance. But now he and Naemon both are unrecognizable. \n\nIt shouldn't bother me, a necromancer. But when I look at our leaders, I see nothing of the nobility and virtue that inspired me to join the Veiled Heritance. \n\nI want to return to Summerset. The forest here seems to grow closer as we work. It surrounds us, unruly and unkind. I've always heard Valenwood was alive. Now I know it is.
My Dearest Love,\n\nWriting these words instead of talking to you in person is the act of a weak man. A coward. What I shall do after I finish this letter is even more cowardly. I am giving up. I'm leaving the Everfull Flagon.\n\nI fought the pull of the strange enchantment as much as I could, and when I was sober I worked to discover a cure, or at least the source, of our terrible affliction. I wanted to defeat this thing, to see your eyes brighten and your mind clear once and for all.\n\nMy heart aches for you, watching you struggle, watching you fight the allure of the mead as I read and researched. We may be close to solving this, but I can't go on. \n\nIs it a weariness of spirit? Is it just a weakness, a character flaw that I can't overcome? I don't know the answer. I only know that I want to run, to try to get free of this place and its insidious spell. I do this knowing that I am leaving you alone. That my soul is lost.\n\nAlways remember, dear one, that you are forever in my heart. Remember our love and find a way to make your own escape from the tavern. And, please, try to forgive me. If you can.\n\n— Gamirth

First day as a Wolfpack Initiate! We'll see how the bastards who mocked me at home feel when a feared bandit comes calling. I'm keeping my excitement restrained, because the senior members, the "Pack Leaders," are very stern and serious. I just like having a place where I belong.\n\nTheir obsession with wolves is strange, but … they take things seriously, and I respect that.
I've now been among the creatures of Bonesnap for thirty-six days. The Goblins are predictably skittish, but otherwise unconcerned with my presence. The Ogres they share the space with are another matter entirely. Luckily it's not been too difficult to stay out of their way. The symbiotic relationship between the Ogres and the Bonesnap tribe is fascinating. I've not encountered anything like it in my research before. \n\nTomorrow I will attempt to approach one of the Bonesnap tribe directly. I'm on the cusp of an inter-species breakthrough! I can feel it.

By Fervidius Tharn, Arch-Prelate of the Maruhkati Selective\n\nIt is the first of the Exclusionary Mandates that the Supreme Spirit Akatosh is of unitary essence, as is conclusively proven by the monolinearity of Time. And clearly, the Arc of Time provides us with the mortal theater for the act of Sacred Expungement. Thus it is our purpose upon Mundus to reverse the error of Sanctus Primus and restore Ak-at-Osh to humanadic purity. To say otherwise is vain and empty persiflage. \n\nTherefore let the Staff of Towers be prepared for the ritual that will cleanse the protean substrate of the Aldmeri Taint. All Selectives are to initiate chants of Proper-Life and maintain them until a state of monothought is achieved. Then each shall Dance, duration-forward then volteface, till the Roll of Time winds withershins. \n\nProphet-Most-Simian guide us! Misplaced Shezarr bless us! May our Wills in this be Enacted!
To My Dearest Cousin,\n\nThe trip from Deshaan to Stonefalls was difficult and a little hazardous, but I made it safely. The directions that Dethisam provided me with were perfect. I'll make sure to warn the people here about the Llodos plague. And I'll make sure the healers are ready to deal with the illness—at least as well as they're able. You can count on me!\n\nI hope things are going well at the Serk. Try to stay healthy and I'll see you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGorvyn
By the ancient mysteries, my plans develop just as I foresaw!\n\nI carry on the wishes and desires of my one, true master—the great and sorely missed King Ranser of Rivenspire. Some called him mad. I know him as the genius and visionary he was. A man ahead of his time. Did he care that I enjoyed the occasional experiment? That I saw a path to power in the intricacies of the dark arts? No. He encouraged me! I will always be grateful to King Ranser for that.\n\nBut sometimes other paths must be followed. I knew that I had to find a new direction as the High King's forces closed upon Traitor's Tor. That's why, regretfully, I left my beloved king's side before the end came. Someone had to survive to carry on our work. Someone had to survive to make Emeric pay for his insults and injuries. I just wish it could have been my king instead of me. Ah, well, that's the way the river runs.\n\nI offered my services to Baron Montclair at the first opportunity. We had made each other's acquaintance at one of the king's functions, and he seemed the most suitable for my ultimate plans. I knew that Count Tamrith would have nothing to do with me or my special talents, and Baron Dorell was too stubborn to take any suggestions I made seriously. But Montclair, he could be swayed. He could be manipulated. He could be forged into the weapon I needed to enact King Ranser's revenge.\n\nIt was easy enough to convince Count Verandis to aid my cause. And a simple forget-me draught was enough to wipe the memories from him. Getting his blood vassal to imbibe the potion was child's play. And when Verandis fed, the alchemical concoction passed from the vassal to him. It was just my good fortune that the Baron's wife was as ill as she was. They were all so worried about her and desperate for a miracle that they accepted what I offered them without question.\n\nBut enough of the past! It is the future I am more interested in right now. My living necromancy experiment worked! I was able to take the living flesh of others and create a totally different living creature. Even now, it grows more powerful in the ruins of Crestshade, awaiting my orders to head out and ravage the countryside. It isn't bogged down by the intelligence or demeanor of those who gave their living flesh to its creation—it is a new and unique entity ready to obey my every command! Imagine what I can do with an army of such creatures!\n\nSoon, all of Rivenspire will be under our control. Then I will convince the Baron to send his undead army and my creations south. This time, the outcome will be much different from Ranser's War. This time, the High King will fall. I have foreseen it. The power of the Ayleid relic told me so.
Heed my commands, servant of the Shadowed Path!\n\nHigh have you risen in our ranks. Succeed in the task I lay upon you and you will rise higher still. Fail and you will die in agony.\n\nThe Lord of Darkness has revealed to me that an ancient relic lies hidden beneath the soil of southern Cyrodiil. The collapse of the Empire enables us to search for it unimpeded. With this relic in hand, I will lead the Shadowed Path in conquest of the Imperial City and all of Cyrodiil!\n\nYou are to scour the cavern known as Haynote. Pulverize every rock, crack open every seam—every effort must be made to uncover the relic. Do not return without it.\n\nI give you command of the Circle of the Shadowed Path formerly ruled by Theurgist Thelas. She is no longer in my favor. Repentance is her lot now, to ensure that she survives to face my continued displeasure.\n\nDo not fail me.\n\n— Dreadlord Naucratius

Entry One: It worked! By mimicking troll behavior and mannerisms, I have gained the trust of the trolls in Crestshade Mine. Though I'm still keeping a healthy distance, the trolls have seen me and have not attacked.\n\nEntry Two: I've made great progress in my interaction with the trolls. I've moved deeper into the mine to better observe them and I can now walk freely among them. I was right. Trolls can be socialized. We might one day live in harmony with them.\n\nFinal Entry: I have finally won the confidence of the troll patriarch. Grimtooth. My work here is done. I wish you could have been here, Gothurg, but I'll see you soon in Shornhelm. I'm going to give Grimtooth a hug goodbye and then I'm on my way.

A mother gave the first gift to her son, and for the rest of his life did he keep it with him.
<<1>> looked up into the night. Moonlight filled her eyes, and she knew what she must do.\n\nMany months she trained, jumping over hill, then dale, then mountaintop. When she could jump no higher, she nearly flew. Tumbling out into Oblivion, all seemed lost—but the twins saw and caught her in their embrace.\n\n<<1>> picked the light from Jone and leapt once more for Nirn. Seeing what she had taken, the moons followed suit—dancing a spiral across the sky.\n\nWhen it seemed they might catch her, they collided and moved no more. Seeing the twins entangled so, <<1>> plucked the light from Jode, as well.\n\nAs she made to leave, they caught her in their embrace. <<1>> begged them to return her to Quin'rawl—for that was the land of her birth. Under the condition that she never again try to steal their light, they returned her to her homeland.\n\nSince that time, <<1>>'s brow has borne fine speckles of stardust—a reminder of her vow never to return to the stars.
This torment is endless. Every day I perform the same tasks of depositing the soulless husks into the depths of Oblivion. I fear I am losing myself as time passes. I dearly hope I won't become one of the shriven.\n\nI hunger, and I can't be sated.
And so begins the adventure of Bernamot the Great! As a soon-to-be-renowned explorer, this tome will officially begin my body of work. Scholarship that I am certain will be studied for centuries to come!\n\nBeginning with this tome, I will uncover the secrets of long-forgotten cities. I will discover the ancient mysteries that have lain undisturbed by mortals for long years. In short, I will go where others fear to tread and find things that others are unworthy to find.\n\nMy journey begins here, in the ancient city of Abagarlas. Lost to time, I discovered this ruined city after extensive research in my father's library. I alone have the courage to explore this dark city.\n\nI will begin by descending this dark stairway before me. Although the way is dimly lit, and dust fills the air, I'm confident the ancient Ayleid architecture is sound. Onward, to greatness!
(An Excerpt)\n\nAt the fourth Falinesti Site now, and, not surprisingly, the Falinesti Faithful here believe me mad, as did those of the Summer, Spring, and Autumn sites. But they'll reconsider when I prove my theory! Oh, they will, and they'll see that my "inane" questions were nothing but "ane!" Yes, they will!\n\nThe Collective Consciousness Theorem will shake the foundations of belief, throughout Tamriel and beyond. I believe it, I KNOW it, and I will PROVE it! I just need a little more time.\n\nIt's simple, really. The Faithful argue endlessly with each other over how the Walking City disappeared, but the irony of it is, they're all right—and they're all wrong! Deep inside each Consciousness lies a grain of truth. A grain falls and lands on another, and soon there's a whole pile of grain! A veritable SILO of truth, all waiting to be collected! The Silo Theorem!\n\nSome of the grains in the Silo so far are fascinating to say the least. All wrong, of course, but it'll be well worth the collecting when I can return to Elden Root and sort through the chaff. More grist for the mill and I'll be able to refine the grains, grinding them into the flour of knowledge. I will bake the Loaf of Truth fully—no half-baked theories for me!\n\nWhere was I?\n\nAh, yes … the Falinesti Faithful's Collective, Grainy Truths and Non-Truths Include:\n\nThe Daedric Interference Conjecture: Falinesti was spirited away by a Daedric Prince or collection of forces (Clavicus Vile leads the voting almost two-to-one over Sheogorath).\n\nThe Magicka Transposition Formulation: A magical attack or accident transported the Walking City to the bottom of the sea (the Swimming City?).\n\nThe Lunar Backlash Premise: The Walking City is actually from one of the two moons (which one is hotly debated) and it is now walking back to (or on) one of the moons.\n\nThe Chicken Nonconformity Detonation: A surprisingly popular theory, I could not find out any agreed-upon details. Will investigate  further in the library at Elden Root.\n\nWayward Metropolist Doctrine: The Walking City got lost on its last trip.\n\nThe Celestial Purloinance Postulation: Stolen by the thief-god Rajhin for some unknown reason.\n\nThe Temporal Reversal Supposition: The Walking City has begun traveling backward in time.\n\nThe Temporal Leap Corollary: Falinesti has sprung forward in time and will be there for us to find it at some future date.\n\nThe Accelerated Invisibility Theory: Falinesti is still here, but moving so quickly between the sites we can't perceive it.\n\nThe Shared Urbanity Theorem: All cities are Falinesti, as it was and as it always will be.\n\n…Where's that ink gotten to?
A Treatise on Conscientious Larceny\n\nBy Zizar-dar\n\nTo steal a thing is simplicity itself. One merely takes what one will and that is that. Even a treasure jealously guarded can be stolen easily under the right circumstances, but such things will not be discussed here.\n\nThis treatise hopes the reader will become a capable pilferer of found things. Methods, distractions, and tools of the trade will not be discussed herein, so if you are a hungry ja'Khajiit looking to make your way on the streets of Senchal, look elsewhere. (Really! What are you doing here? You should be out casing marks!)\n\nBandits, burglars, defalcators, and cheats—keep reading. You might learn a thing or two.\n\nWho Is Worthy of Your Gift?\n\nAny able pilferer knows the next heist is merely a question of time and place, but to keep your heart as light as your gloves, you would do well to be wary of your target!\n\nEasy marks are abundant, but the majority are as desperate as you are. Ignore them! You won't make a name for yourself fleecing ditch-diggers and scullions of their hard-won dinners, and they certainly won't sing the songs every Senchal dreg knows by heart and hair.\n\nNo, look for the merchant whose purse lies buried behind three tall walkers with etched swords and inlaid plate! Watch for the wizard whose tower sends alchemical stenches billowing into the canvas city. Seek out the pomp-pursed dandyclaw whose grounds are free of flicktongues.\n\nNever take all, just a portion! They will deem what you took an "acceptable loss." Admitting their loss would send every shinglestep in town leaping through their casements, which is why they rarely inform the guard.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that they also have the most to pilfer. But what is worth taking, and more importantly, what is there to do with all the riches you've liberated from lightless prisons?\n\nWhat To Do With a Heavy Purse?\n\nTreasure, whether in pockets or in the ground, weighs heavily on mind and the spirit.\n\nIt can be tempting to take famous treasures. Who has not heard the many tales of Rajhin? But as the tales suggest, some treasures are difficult to move and are often worth more in trouble than the gold you'll get for them.\n\nCoin is best, of course. It's small and easy to move. Jewelry comes next, though you may have to melt pieces down if they are too closely filigreed.\n\nPotions can be just as valuable—if not immediately useful to your trade. Look especially for those with restorative properties, for these can be priceless when properly plied.\n\nDon't overlook sundries, either! Frequently a treasure will be too well guarded or trapped with snares to justify the effort, but the mark is not always a lost cause. Only the most paranoid take precautions with the sugarcloset, for who would impede his own sweet-tooth? Much the same with the cupboards, for a hungry belly needs filling fast and tripwires only get in the way.\n\nDo not be too prideful to make off with these things. While they will rarely be missed, they can fill your belly and bring you fame to rival even the luckiest moonlighters!\n\nWhere Should You Flee?\n\nTake as much as you can carry! Fill your pockets and parcels with whatever you can fit, such that it overflows your waistband and bites into your back! Your bounty is as important to your escape as it is to your purse.\n\nWhen you are pursued —as you often will be—spoils secured properly about your vitals will throw off arrows raining down from the walls.\n\nIn the streets, cut release ties to spill out your treasures into the paths of your pursuers. Throw them to the crowds! Their scrambling for your riches will sow confusion, creating obstacles for your escape.\n\nNot only will these efforts delay your pursuers, news of your open hand will spread like wildfire through the streets. What is more valuable than your name? It will buy you safe haven in times of need, food for your belly in lean times, and more importantly will carry you through the darkest of life's troubles.\n\nAnd when you are old and can no longer leap between rooftops, you can rest easily among your childrens' children, assured that your legacy is as clean as a well-greased tumblecatch.\n\nGood luck in your exploits! When they are sung through the taverns and slums of the world, Zizar-dar will be sure to carry the tune.
Selliel's hands moved cautiously from rock to rock. She knew she had to find the buck quickly. Once at the top, she could spot her prey and cut off its escape.\n\nShe grabbed at a root, hoisting herself to the next outcropping, but it gave way under her weight. As she fell, Selliel grabbed her hunting knife and thrust it into the earth wall.\n\nThe knife slowed her descent, but not enough. She slammed hard against a protruding rock, then half-bounced, half-slid into a small crevice cut into the cliffside. Stunned, Selliel smeared bloody hands against her breeches. Too much time had passed. The buck was certainly lost to her.\n\nSelliel growled and spat upon the stone. Cautiously she regained her footing and once more began to climb. Handhold to handhold she went, always looking to the sky. Her path up the cliff face was soon marked with bloody handprints.\n\nShe finally crested the cliff and collapsed, gasping for breath. A quiet, bitter laugh escaped her as she rolled onto her side. Then she noticed the pair of yellow eyes in the brush, not twenty paces away.\n\nSelliel sat up, never looking away from the wolf. It growled and lunged. She leapt aside and slashed with her knife, roaring in defiance. She would be no easy prey.\n\nThe wolf spun and bared its teeth, but hesitated. Selliel did not. She threw her knife. The blade slammed between the wolf's eyes. It fell lifeless to the ground.\n\nSelliel breathed. She pulled her knife from the wolf and looked to the forest, seeking any sign of her prey. Movement, to the east. Antlers. She could still catch it.\n\nShe rushed into the forest.
Selliel kept low as she moved through the forest. She watched for signs of the buck she sought as prey. Did minutes pass, or hours? She did not know. Soon, there was only the chase.\n\nIt was only when Selliel stumbled across the stream that she realized how weary she was. Her earlier skirmish with the lone wolf had taken more from her than she thought. She dipped her hands into the cool water and began to drink. She closed her eyes for a moment.\n\nAfter a few long sips she opened her eyes once more. The buck she had stalked for hours stood five paces away, drinking from the very same stream. Selliel froze.\n \nThe buck seemed to stare at Selliel for a moment. Then it reared into the air and slammed its hooves into the ground.\n\nSelliel leapt back. Bow drawn, arrow nocked. The buck reared again. Selliel stilled her breath. It towered over her, its eyes locked on hers. Selliel counted one, two, three—\n\nThe buck lowered its hooves and turned its body. Selliel saw the three tiny does behind him. She froze. Then the buck walked calmly toward her and nudged the bow away.\n\nSelliel hesitantly put her hand out. The buck licked her palm gently. Then it snorted and walked back to the forest. The does followed the buck. Selliel did not.\n\n*****\n\nShe returned to the cliff top. The wolf was where she had left it, untouched by scavengers. She skinned it, harvested its meat, and stuffed it into her pack. Then she began the long walk home.
Our efforts within Northpoint proceed as planned. Lady Lleraya assures us that success will soon be ours and the march toward Shornhelm will begin shortly.\n\nKeep to your posts and remain vigilant. If the Shornhelm Guard shows up, dispatch them immediately. And continue to watch for any of the missing Northpoint Guard who escaped or went into hiding when we took the city and locked the gates.\n\nIf you have questions, please see me or Captain Khala at the command post that overlooks the eastern shore. One of us will always be stationed there.\n\nAll hail House Montclair!\n\n— Commander Pyline
At last I near the site. Seldom have I been so impatient in my long career. I spent the night at Castle Alessia, mere hours north of the battleground. My excitement prevented me from sleeping more than a few minutes at a time.\n\nI set off at daybreak and made good time until we neared the ruins of Variela Tower. My horse smelled the undead that haunt that desolate place and threw me from the saddle. When I regained consciousness, Lightstep was nowhere in sight. I assume my supplies are with her as well, much good they will do her.\n\nFortunately this journal was inside my cloak. Though it caused a painful bruise when I landed on it, I am still able to take notes for my paper.\n\nI skirted the Variela ruins, not wishing to be eviscerated by the undead shambling about. The graveyard, site of the ancient battle, is just to the south. So little is known about this battle that my research should be eagerly awaited. I hope to answer many questions today.\n\nWere the Ayleids part of a strong contingent of Elves based at Variela? Or were they scouts coming from afar? And what in Julianos' name were Orcs doing there? Did they too have a previously unsuspected stronghold nearby, or were they a band of marauders far from home? Unearthing the graves and examining the artifacts they contain should tell me much.\n\nI have rested here long enough. The shadows lengthen already. I will make a pitiful camp in the graveyard and begin my excavations in the morning. Discovery awaits!
Recorded by Vothel Bethalas\n\nThe following are two tales of the Nord hero Wuunding and his hammer, Tumult. Every town I come across seems to have another legend about him, and every Nord I've met swears up and down that they're all true. Their fascination with these exaggerated heroes is charming, in a way, and I've found it an entertaining diversion to set some of the tales to paper, as I've never seen them preserved elsewhere.\n\nWuunding and the Mountain\n\nMighty Wuunding desired to pass into the high mountains, for he had heard rumors of a powerful troll lord he wished to fight. The slopes were steep and the snow was thick, and he found it harder and harder to plow his way through. At last, he had enough of digging and struggling. He shouted at the mountain as loud as he could, asking it to shed its snow, but the mountain was stubborn and would not listen. \n\nFrustrated, he cleared the snow from a rock and used Tumult to strike it with all his might. The mountain rumbled with pain, and all the snow rushed past him into the valley so that he could pass. The mountains remember that pain to this day, so you must be careful when shouting at them. Not all can stand against an avalanche.\n\nThe Melting of the March\n\nIn the old days, a great frozen Daedra made its home in Eastmarch, slaughtering Nords and conjuring an unending blizzard. Like any good Nord, Wuunding hated Daedra, and he sought to free the land and return it to its people. When he tried to venture into the heart of the storm, he found that his body began to freeze, and he was forced to turn back.\n\nAs he wandered the edge of the storm, he prayed to Kyne for help. Before long, he came upon a shack where an old woman lived. She invited him in, and upon hearing his tale, she produced a small flask. "This will help you reach the Daedra," she said, "but do not drink too much at once." The mead, the sweetest he ever tasted, burned in his belly, and he set off right away, immune to the magical blizzard. \n\nWhen he found the Daedra at last, they battled all across the land. The magical cold was like nothing he'd faced before, and he felt his strength failing. Without regard to the woman's warning, he downed the whole flask. He burned with a fire so powerful that Tumult roared with flames. The Daedra melted more and more with each strike, leaving steaming pools behind. In the end, nothing was left of the Daedra but the stinking puddles, and Wuunding and Tumult were consumed by the flames. The pools remain even now, a reminder of Wuunding's heroism.
By Lizabet Delrusc\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear the phrase "A hero's weapon"? My guess is you don't think of a dagger or call to mind an image of a soldier huddling behind his shield. No, you think of a fine greatsword, gleaming in the sun, slicing through enemies just as easily as it cuts the air and singing against armored foes sent staggering by the force of its strikes. That is a hero's weapon.\n\nI have spent long hours observing the soldiers training in the courtyard below my chambers. It is quite clear to me that the strongest, bravest, smartest, and most handsome of the warriors always choose the greatsword (trust me). It balances brute force with skillful maneuvers, and it is neither as clumsy as a hammer or axe nor as easily broken as a smaller sword or bow. The wielder must have immense strength, but he must also have great agility and insight, knowing when to dodge and how to parry blows. \n\nOf course there are legendary figures who used other weapons, but you'll certainly agree that none inspire the same kind of wonder and awe. When you see someone striding into town covered in heavy armor with a greatsword in tow, you know you're looking at the very face of daring. A greatsword wielder doesn't fear injury; he charges into battle knowing that foes will flee or suffer grave consequences. You might feel a bit faint as they walk by, overwhelmed by such a valiant sight! \nOne who wields such a sword shows they embody the hero's approach: to master all aspects of combat. I watch them train their endurance and strength by lifting and running, see them practice moving and dodging. Greatsword wielders train harder than all the other soldiers and are much stronger—that is quite clear.\n\nNot everyone is cut out for heroism, and not every soldier or adventurer will have legends crafted from their deeds. If you aspire to more than just your duty or daily work, and feel the call of battle, then I advise you to set your sights high; aspire to master the greatsword!
Your orders, sergeant, are to take five soldiers and establish watchposts on high ground. Your area of responsibility is the region between Drakelowe Keep and the village of Cropsford. Go no farther north than the ruins at Nornal.\n\nTrack all invaders within this area, regardless of which alliance the troops belong to. Estimates of group size and direction of movement are vital.\n\nSend me daily reports. I expect we'll be at the bridge for some time to come.\n\n— Captain Priscus

By Vinicius Imbrex, Archbishop of Chorrol, 1E 1051—1087 \n\nThus Stendarr looked upon the world of mortals, and he found it afflicted by Abominations. And he made it known unto his priests, resolutes, and templars, that these unnatural profanities are abhorrent in his sight, and are to be exterminated by the Righteous without halt or mercy. For these Abominations are each and every the eternal enemies of the mortals of the Mundus, and shall not be suffered to abide among us. \n\nAnd these Abominations are four in kind, and may be known thusly:\n\n—The DAEDRA, those unworldly horrors that are not of the Mundus, but come from Oblivion to inflict cruelty and death upon the mortals of Tamriel. \n\n—The MANBEASTS, those mortals who through traffic with the bestial Hircine do change their skins for those of animals, preying thence upon the innocent. \n\n—The RISEN CORPSES, those restless undead whose rotting bodies persist with loathsome and unnatural vigor, sowing fear and agony among the living. \n\n—The DEATHLESS VAMPYRES, who feed horrifically upon honest citizens, regarding righteous mortals as mere cattle to sate their unholy hungers.\n\nKnow these Four Abominations, O ye righteous, and gather to slay them where're they appear.
By Kiasa-Veda, the Chronicler of Blades\n\nAs all schoolchildren know, northern Tamriel was invaded by a legion of Akaviri raiders in 1E 2700. Mighty warriors with potent powers, these Akaviri cut a swath through Skyrim, defeating all opponents, until they were met at Pale Pass by a Cyrodilic army under the command of General Reman. After a brief battle, the Akaviri surrendered en masse to Reman, saying that in him, they had found what they had come to Tamriel to seek. \n\nWith the Akaviri added to his own army, Reman marched on, pacifying most of Tamriel, becoming Emperor, and founding the Second Empire. The best and wisest of the Akaviri became the Dragonguard, under the Emperor Reman's personal command. \n\nFor the next two centuries the Dragonguard protected the Reman Dynasty, defending the Emperors with abilities said to have been learned from the Dragons themselves, which persisted in Akavir far longer than they did in Tamriel. \n\nBut when Reman III was assassinated in 2920, that was the end of the Reman Dynasty (as well as the First Era). Officially the Dragonguard was disbanded, some said in shame at having failed to protect the Emperor. However, when the Potentate Versidue-Shaie assumed the Ruby Throne, the Dragonguard was unofficially reactivated, more as an intelligence network than as an honor guard. \n\nOther former members of the Dragonguard followed different pursuits. Some joined their former centurion, Dinieras-Ves, when he founded the organization that would come to be known as the Fighters Guild. Others became roving adventurers, selling their services as combat trainers or swords-for-hire. \n\nOne of these was a former Dragonguard whose name is now lost, and is known only to this chronicler as the Grandmaster. He took it upon himself to ensure that the martial and mystical arts of the old Akaviri would survive into the new and turbulent Second Era. However, he would teach his skills only on condition that those he taught would go on to teach others. This was the origin of those whom we now call "the Dragon Knights."
(Ed. note: This letter is one of Margaux Cantillon's earliest recovered correspondences. Her impact on the restoration arts and her unmatched compassion will long be remembered, and this letter grants us insight into the strength of character she displayed even as a young healer.)\n\nJourneyman Bachand,\n\nI received your gift yesterday, and I am taken aback. It's clear that you spared no expense; I have never laid eyes on such an ornate staff. The silver and golden symbols of Mara inlaid with pearl are beautiful, and the sculpting of my likeness into the metal at its top is … flattering.\n\nPlease believe that it is only with the greatest regret that I cannot accept it. I appreciate the spirit of the gift, but I simply cannot use it to tend to my wards. We travel in different magical circles these days. I know such a magnificent staff could be borne proudly in yours, but I have dedicated myself to tending the unfortunate, and to use such a costly implement in my work would be unseemly.\n\nYou asked about my studies. My instructor says my empathy is strong, and that the outrage I feel at the suffering of others gives my restorative spells potency. I am humbled to have a gift for this noble calling. I only wish healing received more focus during apprenticeship; the emphasis on destruction seems so misplaced to me now.\n\nPerhaps we will meet again at the next Guild Symposium in Wayrest.\n\nYours in Mara's Grace, \n\nMargaux Cantillon
By Humius Acidinus\n\nIt is popular, especially among young upstarts who wish to establish themselves as intellectual contenders, to dismiss the study of harnessing the destructive potential of magicka as crude or simplistic. Those who embrace this argument prefer to spend time researching obscure theoretical topics instead of the more practical applications of magic. \n\nIn truth, these pedants accomplish little beyond writing tomes of their own to refute the postulations of their contemporaries, wasting their time arguing hypotheticals with no basis in practical magical study. They are so distracted trying to outwit one another in their imaginary field that they never produce substantial advancements. It is my conviction that this self-indulgent behavior obstructs progress (concrete gains such as spell discovery) in arcane studies.\n\nI do not deny that magic is deep and complex, and our understanding is far from complete. However, I question the value of arguments over theories with very little basis in observable phenomena before we fully grasp less complicated subjects. In my years of practice, I have found that studying manifestations of magicka that seem the simplest often provides the clearest look at the nature of magic. Without a complete understanding of what seems to be basic, how could anyone advance magic and bring benefit to practitioners and Tamriel at large? I implore you, reader, to take care that you do not fall into the category of the fruitless intellectual.
Foreman Albanus,\n\nYou are paid to ensure that trees are felled and lumber shipped to the city. You are not a nursemaid. I do not want to hear any more tales of cursed ground, bleeding trees, or scared workers.\n\nDo your job or I will find someone who can.\n\nMaximinus

Lanalda danced through Valenwood, willing the leaves to change colors. Nothing happened, as she had no power over them.\n\nShe stomped her foot like an angry child, and saw the earth dimple beneath her. Enchanted, Lanalda stomped again and again, each time deepening the vale. When rain fell, she danced wildly within the dip she'd created.\n\nSlowly, it filled with water. Lanalda danced gleefully, though the waters covered her. They say her unseen dance creates the ripples on the lake.
Ofglog gro-Barkbite,\n\nThe entire stronghold gathered around to see what you learned at that fancy college. We closed our eyes, just like you asked. You said some fancy words, and then … nothing. When we opened our eyes, you were gone.\n\nMoramat opened her fool mouth and wondered if you'd turned invisible—and they all looked at me! Everyone knows you've been sniffing around my forge for years, and they know I've turned you away. Then Sharnag blurted out, "Looks like he finally came to his senses," and they all started laughing.\n\nThis is the last time you make a fool of me. Wherever you went, I hope you never come back. I hate you.\n\n—Shakul

This pillar isn't just a cenotaph for Frandar Hunding. It's where his ancestors hid his treasures! Hunding was the greatest hero of Bhosek's people. Why he never tried to crack open the monument is beyond me. \n\nI don't know much about stonework. I can't exactly ask around, can I? If Bhosek catches wind of what I'm doing, he'll take it all for himself.\n\nBut how hard can it be? Hit the stone with a pick until it crumbles, then plunder everything inside. I'm sure to find a fortune behind those walls!
by Cloelius Maluginensis\nSupply Sergeant, Seventh Legion\n\nIn my twenty years as supply captain for the Seventh Imperial, I learned one absolute truth: provisioning is the same whether feeding yourself or an entire army. Per Magus-General Septima Tharn's request, I will share what I know to aid the provisioners of less accomplished legions.\n\nStep 1: Acquire Ingredients \n\nWhen you are in the field, your backpack is the only pantry upon which your soldiers can rely. Requisition anything you can find—every barrel, chest, or sack of grain should make its contribution to your cause.\n\nAs an Imperial soldier you have the right to requisition as much as you want, but use discretion. A citizen with an empty larder will have long memories of Imperial imposition. A single handful, scoop, or item from each barrel, chest, or sack is my simple rule.\n\nStep 2: Acquire Recipes\n\nNever forget that you are a provisioner, not a chef. You aren't cooking personal meals for the Duchess of Cheydinhal. It doesn't matter how the food tastes as long as it feeds your cohort. You want recipes that are fast, simple, and best made in bulk.\n\nTake roasted chicken breast, a meal that requires poultry. It doesn't matter that you know the ingredients required—without a proper recipe, they're just raw meat. Locals always have their own ways to prepare local ingredients, so stay vigilant for recipes while requisitioning supplies.\n\nStep 3: Cook, Cook, Cook \n\nOnce you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then cook them. Don't burn the food.\n\nRemember to serve your cohort what it needs most. Scouts and skirmishers need plenty of vegetables. Mages in your cohort are best fed fruits. Infantry can always use hearty meat dishes. Never forget that a hot meal can make the difference between life and death.\n\nAddendum: Brewing On The Go\n\nI hear enough questions about brewing to warrant its own section. I recommend you never keep more than a flask of fine brew with you. Your cohort will know it's a prize for those who truly distinguish themselves.\n\nYet sometimes the cohort needs liquid courage, such as before a battle or a parade review. This is when I brew horrible swill from local recipes, both to shock the soldiers into a state of confident readiness and to keep them from growing fond of the stuff.\n\nStep 1 and Step 2 are identical to the similar steps for cooking. As for the third?\n\nStep 3: Brew, Brew, Brew\n\nOnce you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then brew them. Don't spoil the drink.\n\nI often present excess brew to the locals who "donated" the ingredients in the first place. This is not Imperial requisition policy, but it helps my cohort stay in their future good graces should we suffer a retreat due to the actions of less stalwart legions.
By Lady Radurra-dra of Torval, \nSouthwest Elsweyr Representative to the Thalmor\n\nHave you met Headmaster Tanion? A most polite and correct mer, who was horrified when I informed him that he'd applied a most improper suffix to my name, instead of the appropriate "dra." (To spare him further embarrassment, we shall not go into details—but ask me sometime after I've had a couple of glasses of tawny port.)\n\nSo it seemed like a good idea to this one to compile a list of the most common Khajiiti name-titles—at least the proper ones—for the benefit of the College of Aldmeri Propriety, and all our new allies from Summerset and Valenwood. \n\nFeminine Honorifics\n\n"-dra" is a title of respect awarded to one known for her wisdom and wit, or as a consolation to one who has achieved a venerable age. I prefer to think that, in my case, it is the former condition that applies. \n\n"-daro" is for one who has achieved excellence in the nimble manipulation of loose articles, such as small decorative objects and unattached coinage. It may also be awarded to one who is lithe of tongue.\n\n"-do" is for one who has earned renown as a warrior—usually male, but occasionally (too occasionally, in this one's opinion) a female. \n\n"-ko" is an appellation for respected healers, mages, and scholars, and is also sometimes added to the names of learned ancestors. Perhaps, once this one has passed on, her children will refer to her as "Radurra-ko"? …Well, it is a warm thought.\n\n"-la" is an oh-so-fleeting title applied to graceful maidens who are unmarried, or behave as if they were. This one remembers fondly when she was "Radurra-la"—just last year, no? \n\n"-ma" is for a young child of either gender, a term of endearment, except when it is shouted or snarled. \n\nMasculine Honorifics\n\n"-dar" is perhaps the most ancient of all Khajiiti titles, an appellation earned by those who are nimble in fingers and wits, and are both inquisitive and acquisitive. I have heard that it is also sometimes applied to politicians, but such usage would surely be jocular (and never employed by me, sweetness!).\n\n"-do" is an honorific for one who has earned distinction on the field of battle or in personal duels. Beware of those strutting lions who apply the title to themselves, not waiting for others to award it. \n\n"-dro" is a title applied to wise elders, patriarchs, grandfathers, and those who walk too slowly in front of one in the marketplace. \n\n"-jo" is an appellation for respected physicians, scholars, and mages, though it is also frequently adopted by charlatans and mountebanks. I remember a handsome, dark panther in Corinthe who wanted to sell me a string of "enchanted" pearls … but that is a story for another moon. \n\n"-ra" is for an esteemed leader of soldiers, trade, or governance. A cat-ra often has a harem of kitten-las, sometimes ostentatiously so, especially if he is making up for a deficiency in his short-tail. \n\n"-ri" is a title rarely awarded, as it is reserved for great leaders of our people, Speakers, Kings, and Manes—and perhaps for a virile lover whilst wrestling amongst the pillows. Or so I have heard. \n\nThis one has also heard that among the faddish youth of Alabaster, it is the fashion to place the honorific before the name, rather than after. Radurra-dra likes to be fashionable, but she fears she cannot approve of this practice, as it will tend to make Khajiiti names sound far too alike. That would be boring—and we do not wish to be boring, yes?
A Report Prepared for the Star-Gazers\nBy Valinka Stoneheaver\n\nIn my capacity as a collector of objects, a delver of dungeons, and an explorer of (soon-to-be) renown, I often take on commissions to obtain specific items or information. The Star-Gazers of Craglorn hired me to find out everything I could pertaining to the recently formed group known as the Scaled Court.\n\nThe Scaled Court seemed to appear out of nowhere, popping up all across Craglorn in the wake of the mysterious disappearances of the Celestial Guardians from the night sky. With a little digging and the judicial application of free drinks and similar bribes, I was able to ascertain that prior to arriving in Craglorn, the group had been a loose association of mercenaries on their way to battle in Cyrodiil. \n\nOriginally led by the Nord warlord, Milvern One-Sword, the mercenaries entered the region with the intent of offering their services to whichever army was willing to pay a hefty price in gold and spoils. But they were rebuked and turned away by the Cyrodiil generals, who refused to leave their fighting to hired thugs. The unemployed mercenaries roamed the Craglorn wilderness for a time as One-Sword struggled to come up with another plan to keep his band together. While camped in the wasteland southeast of Dragonstar, a lone figure wandered into view of the disheartened group. \n\nShe had the regal bearing of an Imperial and a confidence that allowed for no opposition. "I bring a message from He Who Has No Season," she proclaimed in a loud, commanding voice. "You are aimless wanderers in who the Serpent sees kindred spirits. Join me and the Serpent will reward you a thousandfold!"\n\nOf course, Milvern One-Sword took umbrage with this stranger trying to turn his band against him. As he drew his blade and approached her, she smiled calmly and whispered, "Serpent, protect your servant." Suddenly, the ghostly visage of a great snake surrounded the woman. She pointed, and the ghostly snake uncoiled and struck like lightning, piercing Milvern's armor with two sharp, venom-dripping fangs. He was dead before his body hit the ground.\n\n"The Celestial Serpent has sent me to gather you," the woman proclaimed, "to give you purpose and glory and power beyond your imagining! I am the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems, and together we are the Scaled Court!"\n\nAnd that, as far as I can determine, is how the Scaled Court came to Craglorn.
By Phrastus of Elinhir\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that necromancy, the foulest of all magical endeavors, is on the rise. Word of unsettled spirits, shambling corpses, and worse spreads across Tamriel, planting seeds of fear in common folk. There is good reason to be concerned, and it is my scholarly duty to inform the ignorant in hopes that a more educated populace will be better prepared to recognize and face undead dangers.\n\nNecromancy, as you likely know, is the manipulation of souls, soul energies, or corpses of the dead. Unwilling spirits are often involved, and in the eyes of any rational being, the "study" of this type of magic is repellant. It should not be surprising to you that much knowledge of necromancy is attributed to Daedric forces, specifically those of the abhorrent Molag Bal, further cementing it as a sphere that must be shunned. \n\nI present to you now an accounting of the general types of undead:\n\nThe Reanimated\n\nThese monstrosities are formed when a necromancer summons and instills an enslaved spirit, often a minor Daedric essence, into a corpse or construct of bodies. Reanimations take many shapes, from the lowly skeleton (favorite of novice necromancers) to the hulking flesh atronach. The need for unconsecrated corpses poses a danger to communities, as it is known to drive wayward mages to murder in their lust for power. To minimize encounters with reanimations, avoid poorly-kept graveyards and hidden caves or ruins, and report any suspicion of necromancy to your local authorities for investigation.\n\nThe Returned\n\nGhosts, wraiths, and spectres manifest for a variety of reasons. Some are bound to Nirn through powerful curses, some are summoned forth through rituals, and others find their souls unable or unwilling to depart due to unfinished business. Some are even ancestors bound by their own families, a practice the Dark Elves claim is not necromancy at all—guarwash! \n\nMy recent studies into the phenomenon known as the Soulburst indicate a tie between it and a surge in returned sightings and activity, strongly implicating a persistent disruption in natural post-extant soul conveyance. Detractors to this theory, notably the misguided Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, have yet to produce any counter-theories that do not crumble under the slightest scrutiny.\n\nThe Accursed\n\nUndeath is not always a product of renegade mages tampering with souls and rotting flesh. Cursed diseases such as Noxiphilic Sanguivoria can corrupt the living. The result is an undead creature that requires the blood of the living for sustenance. Vampires have a tendency to organize into reclusive clans, hiding away beneath the ground and surfacing only to obtain more thralls to feed upon. In some cases, though, their minds are known to degrade to the point of insanity, leaving a raging husk of a creature with no mental capacity commonly called a "bloodfiend." Any sightings of such creatures should be reported to a local Fighters Guild. \n\nAbominable Miscegenations \n\nSome undead defy simple classification. The lich, for one, is a corpse that is self-reanimated by the soul it bore in life. Typically, only powerful spellcasters seeking immortality achieve this state. Luckily for common folk, liches are often focused obsessively on continuing their own studies, and they are not likely to be encountered by travelers that keep their noses out of ancient ruins. \n\nNow that you are more informed about this vile art and its repellent products, hopefully you are better-prepared to assess undead threats. It goes without saying (though I will certainly say it) that we all have a responsibility to report and combat necromancy, especially in these times. Do not let anyone convince you that there is some kind of benefit to be had in exploring these detestable magics—any reasonable individual can see the madness in such a claim.
2nd First Seed\nWe're uncertain if it's possible, but what the master wants, the master gets. Our presence in Craglorn intensifies by the day, but he remains … inconsolable. I understand his consternation—the highlands would be completely under our control if he could roam free.\n\nThe combination of troll and Nedic ritual that finally cracked his prison can make no further progress on it. Even the thralled Celestial Guardians have failed. I don't know what options remain to us.\n\nThe Regents will do their work in his stead, of course. The master chose them for a reason.\n\n4th First Seed\nPerhaps the answer has been staring me in the face. We have more nirncrux stored at Sanctum Ophidia than we could ever hope to deplete. We could fuel a war for years with our supply.\n\nAnd as a primordial dust, nirncrux channels energy—transfers it. The master is composed entirely of Celestial energy. Perhaps that is the key.\n\n5th Second Seed\nThe master possessed a ritual that required just a little blood from our Courtlings (unfortunately, we lost the volunteers, but footsoldiers can always be replaced) and a smattering of nirncrux dust.  We have earned some gratitude from the master—some patience. It will be a while yet before he will walk from this cavern on his own power, but the vessel, at least, is complete.\n\nAnd may whatever god they believe in help those who stand in its path.
Extract the red brittle from the surrounding rock, making sure not to break the larger pieces.\n\nHeat the red brittle until the element glows like a burning ember.\n\nWhile the red brittle still glows hot, grind it beneath the millstone wheels or pound it beneath the steam hammers until it becomes a fine, crimson powder..\n\nCollect the red brittle powder (the Scaled Court calls it nirncrux) into carts and distribute it evenly to Armorer Uthik, Runescriber Kulth, and Regent Boward of the Scaled Court.\n\nBlood for our enemies, steel for our tribe!\n\n—Exarch Braadoth
Esteemed Exarch Braadoth,\n\nI hope this letter finds you as strong and as intimidating to our enemies as the day we met.\n\nI have studied the process you utilize to imbue your magnificent armor and your spectacular body decorations with nirncrux dust, and I applaud your ingenuity and craftsmanship. I truly am in awe at what you have accomplished.\n\nFirst, Ilthag Ironblood is a master tactician and a remarkable trainer. How he accomplishes this never ceases to amaze me, and I have tried to replicate his process to no avail. I never imagined that trolls and welwas could be turned into servants and soldiers. Adding their power to our forces makes the Scaled Court undefeatable!\n\nYour talented armorer has crafted armor that is lighter, stronger, and literally glowing with nirncrux power. A remarkable achievement that we never would have been able to match without her skill and expertise. Not only was it a stroke of brilliance to then equip trained trolls and welwas with the infused armor, but as production increases I look forward to equipping all of our forces with the special armor.\n\nThe artistry demonstrated by your runescriber sends tingles up my spine. His designs are hypnotic, and I could swear they seem to move as I try to study the intricate patterns. By adding nirncrux dust to the ink and brands, the magic he imbues in his subjects increases a hundredfold. Remarkable! Combined, the training, the armor, and the body runes make the trolls nearly unstoppable.\n\nIf I may, allow me to offer a final ritual that you can employ to make the nearly unstoppable into the virtually invincible. Try it on one of your trolls and let me know if the results are everything I promise.\n\n—Elska, Regent of Fanged Fury
This place is amazing! Unlike a lot of the ruins we've poked around in, this place actually has working apparatuses and ancient guardians and everything. I better watch my step. Wouldn't want to attract the attention of a spider construct or one of those rolling ball things. And those centurions! I wouldn't want to meet one of them in a dark and scary ruin. Oh, wait a moment ….\n\nHey, I just noticed that I lost the first two pages of my notebook. I hate it when that happens! Raynor says I'm too hard on my equipment, but I think that merchant in Orsinium just sold me an inferior bit of merchandise. Look at this binding! It's already cracked and fraying! Sturdy as a stronghold wall my arse!\n\nOh, I know what will make falling into this ruin worthwhile and keep Raynor from giving me any grief. I need to find him a Dwarven power core. He loves to collect old things like that. And maybe he won't blow this one up quite as quickly as the last time.
A Scholary Exploration of the Mysterious Fight Club, by Ebidazner Kornod\n\nI have been searching for the elusive and mysterious contest of champions for more years than I care to admit. I first heard of the secret battleground in Valenwood, when Biiri the Beautiful was spoken of as the legendary Champion of the Games. Tried as I might, I could not find the location of these rumored games, nor could I find anyone who had actually seen any of the battles, even though the inns of Valenwood were alive with tales of Biiri's prowess.\n\nAfter weeks of futile searching, the tales of the Valenwood Arena evaporated as quickly as they started. Somehow, some way, a massive, hidden arena of multiple levels simply vanished. I assumed this was just further proof that the stories were more legend than truth, but still the idea of the place nagged at me. It haunted my dreams and interrupted my thoughts at the oddest moments.\n\nWhen next I heard rumors of a mysterious and secret Arena, I was in Windhelm for the Skald-King's Konunleikar. In the shadows of the dingy mead halls, rough and tumble Nords described a magical battlegrounds where the environment changed with every match. To earn a victory meant getting to fight another match. To find defeat was to experience a bloody and violent death. It sounded gruesome and fascinating to me, and the Nords drank it up like it was the sweetest beverage they ever tasted.\n\nThe place was called the Skyrim Arena, but I was never able to locate an entrance to the battlegrounds. This time they spoke of the glorious victories of Holgstad the Horrible. He was supposedly a Nord's Nord. Tall as a troll and twice as powerful, Holgstad was rumored to enter each match carrying a double-bladed axe and a dagger that sparked with lightning. They said he had a trio of Nord shield maidens that fought by his side, and that they were destroying the competition in match after match—much to the approval of the Arena's mysterious patron.\n\nI think I was getting close to finding the secret location when suddenly the stories stopped. It happened again. This supposedly ancient arena of stone and metal had disappeared as quickly as it had arrived, taking Holgstad and his shield maidens with it. The Nords cheered, drank to their honored champion, and then went back to dealing with the more mundane happenings of the realm.\n\nI dispaired of ever getting that close to the Arena again when I happened to be traveling on one of the Dragonstar Caravan Company's wagons. One of the caravan guards was bragging about how he was going to compete in the Dragonstar Arena when he returned to Craglorn after this run. He knew he was strong enough to challenge the current champion. All he had to do was convince three of his fellow guards to join him so he had a proper team.\n\nOver drinks around the evening fire, I was able to learn as much as the guard could tell me about the Arena. He explained that it was an ancient ruin that suddenly appeared in the hills behind the town of Dragonstar a few weeks back. Challengers were arriving from all over Craglorn and beyond to compete in the secret games. They had even set up a makeshift camp outside the Arena entrance. I knew this was the Arena I had been searching for, that somehow it changed locations whenever the competition began to falter. That it was capable of moving—stone by stone—across the world.\n\nNow I'm inside the Arena, hoping to gain access to the games themselves. I need to see how the environments change. I need to determine if it's some amazing feat of ancient engineering or some sort of magic that makes the impossible happen for every match. And I need to determine who the mysterious patron of the Arena actually is. I have suspicions, of course, but I'm sure the truth will turn out to be exceedingly stranger than anything I can imagine.
Dearest Teewajsi,\n\nToday I visited a beverage maker not too far distant from the amazing city of Windhelm. The place is called Voljar's Meadery, and they craft and serve the most wonderful potation I have ever had the good fortune to pour down my throat. They call it mead! And you'll never guess what the primary ingredient is. Fermented honey! That's right, they actually make it using nectar regurgitated by bees! Oh, I mean xouch, those flying insects with the stingers that buzz around your flower garden.\n\nAnyway, the Nords love the stuff, so I figured I'd give it a try while I was here. It was delicious! I may have to learn the recipe from one of the crafters so I can make this wonderful concoction when I return to Murkmire.\n\nI never did quite understand why they had an Orc head on a pike in front of their property, but there are many Nord customs that make absolutely no sense to me.\n\nGive my best to the little ones,\n\nSeeks-the-Sun
Oh what a legend we have wrought! Who would ever dare to challenge the powerful and immortal Thukhozod, master of the necromantic arts? Thukhozod is, was, and forever shall be. He appeared hundreds of years ago and established a hidden sanctum where he could perform his rituals and experiments in relative peace. He frightens the locals, he communes with chiefs and warlords, and he consults with the spirits of the dead.\n\nNow, as I enter my thirtieth year as Thukhozod the Eternal, I have decided to write down our dirty little secret. Thukhozod isn't one, he's many, and I am just the latest in a long line of powerful necromancers.\n\nThe first Thukhozod was the original Thukhozod, an Orc necromancer with a plan and a dream. He claimed to be immortal when he participated in the Three Clans War, and certainly his efforts were recognized as significantly contributing to the victory of Shatul Clan. But I don't believe what happened next was his idea. I think that credit should go to his son, Glazoz.\n\nWhen Thukhozod died unexpectedly, his son and apprentice Glazoz decided to keep the event a secret. He dealt with his father's body and took on his identity. In that way, Thukhozod continued and his march toward immortality was on.\n\nThe list of Orcs, each and every one an ancestor of mine, goes on for pages and is stored in a hidden vault deep within this sanctum. It includes at least two daughters who replaced their fathers and took on the role without giving any indication as to their true genders. Now, as this damnable illness eats away at me, I await the arrival of my own son, Khoruzoth. His mother, Yazoga, was supposed to present him with his heritage. He should be on his way as I write this. I hope he arrives while I'm still healthy enough to help him with the transition to his new life.
Son, \n\nMy agents in Windhelm inform me that King Jorunn has dispatched a trading party to Orsinium. They could reach the Orc city before you. Loathe as I am to allow those Pact skeevers to secure the trading rights that High King Emeric so desperately wants, I would rather deal with Nords than with those green beasts of Wrothgar. Those of us among the true Breton aristocracy have to wonder what Emeric is really up to, what with his Covenant and other plans. \n\nYour wife is a lovely woman, to be sure, but her politics make her place the interests of savages ahead of true Bretons. You need to help her choose the correct path, son. True Bretons know that Wrothgar should be under Breton rule, not awarded to the Orcs.  \n\nI know you worry, but if you keep your own counsel and listen to your father, everything will work out.\n\nYour father, Baron Materre

By Gaspard Esmery, Captain of Gaspard's Stalkers\n\nMercenary companies got a bad reputation during Potentate Versidue-Shaie's War of Subjugation, when paid troops of Imperial vassals went rogue, pillaging their way across the provinces until the Legions brought them down. But with the rise of the Three Alliances and the return of general warfare across Tamriel, our services are once again in high demand. The mercenaries are back!\n\nDAGGERS\n\nThe mercenary's broad-bladed dagger is nearly as long as a short sword, made for punching or hacking through the weak spots in a downed opponent's armor. They are not balanced for throwing, but are heavy enough to deliver a solid blow if hurled.
A powerful Riekr who refers to himself as "the King-Chief" currently terrorizes the land to the northeast of Orsinium. He wields an ancient scepter that the museum believes was crafted by Kloth, first chief of the Orgak Orc clan that once flourished in northern Wrothgar. It was a symbol of power and authority for the Orc clan and appears to be used in similar fashion by the self-styled king-chief.\n\nNo Orsimer can rest while this historic relic remains in the hands of a lowly Riekr—no matter how powerful that lowly Riekr may be.
History isn't relegated to the past. It is created every day with each significant event that takes place. Take, for example, the threat of the ogre shaman, Mad Urkazbur. This ogre elder has arisen as a powerful leader among the brutish creatures, gathering a small army in the wilds of northern Wrothgar.\n\nNot only does the mad ogre command his powerful brethren, but he seems to possess the magic to control snow and ice. His impressive abilities include the power to create enchanted duplicates of himself made entirely of ice. These effigies start out small, about the size of a child's doll, and grow large enough to fight at his side.\n\nOnce this clear and present danger is dealt with, the museum would love to display an ice-effigy to commemorate the event. If collected before fully enchanted, the effigy remains small and frozen—a perfect relic of a recent threat.
Ever faithful was Tamahl,\nQuick of wit and slow to fall,\nSo his friends remember.\n\nHe swung his blade with peerless grace,\nA tranquil mask upon his face,\nAs his enemies remember.\n\nFor <<1>>'s loyal aide,\nNo debt of honor went unpaid,\nShall everyone remember.
Day 1\nOur first hours in Rkindaleft proved largely fruitless. We were ambushed by some pale Orcs. They seemed completely mad. Lost a few of the sellswords we hired. Jeirmun and <<1>> are convinced the place is cursed.\n\nFools. If the place wasn't dangerous, there'd be nothing of value inside! I'm glad <<2>> is in charge. He wants to press on, so we press on.\n\nDay 2\nA strange day, but a productive one. Still no explanation for what drove the pale Orcs mad. We saw more of them, but they skittered away from us, hiding in the glacial portions. Good riddance.\n\nAmazing how Dwarven constructs seem to last forever. Several have frozen solid, but a few are still humming along. We expected them to attack, but they ignored us. It's as if we weren't even here. Occasionally I feel like they are looking at me, but when I turn they move along.\n\n<<2>> forbade us from studying the constructs. "Don't give them a reason," he said. It salts my eyes that he's right.\n\nDay 3\nWe know why the ruin is melting. Someone was here after the Dwemer, likely for a very long time. It's hard to make out their intentions, but the research materials scattered around the place suggest an extensive team of mages who required vast amounts of thermoharmonic power for their purposes. We've collected everything we could for later study.\n\n<<2>> is losing it. One minute he's arguing with <<1>> about pressing on, the next he's jumping at the smallest sound. He keeps saying the ruin is alive. That the walls are watching us. He needs to get some sleep.\n\nDay 4\nSeparated from <<2>> and the others after the pale Orcs attacked. Leaves me in charge of two mercenaries. I don't even know their names, but they answer to "you." Good enough for me.\n\nI told them about the thermoharmonic valve we saw on the way here and ordered them to close it. The pressure seals the door, just like <<2>> said. Release the valve, the door opens. I'll wait by the door until they release the valve. Once inside I'll see if I can find out why all this pressure is directed into one room.\n\nDay 5\nIt wasn't enough. The door lost pressure, but it still wouldn't budge. An hour later the pressure restored itself. The mercenaries never returned. Did they run? Were they killed?\n\nThe constructs are watching me now. Coming closer. Perhaps if I'm very still they won't—
Nobody said I couldn't bring my notes!

I'm trying to reach you. Yes, you. This is harder than you can imagine, writing words to paper that doesn't exist.\n\nWhite light. There's white light all around me.\n\nAm I alive? Am I dreaming? Are these the Colored Rooms?\n\nHelp me. I want to come home. Please.\n\nDarien
A Poem by Drusk the Would-Be Bard\n\nI never thought I'd live to see\nA structure in more sorry shape than me.\n\nIts tumbled stone and broken crown\nDo nothing to alleviate my deepest frown.\n\nIt stands forlorn within the wood\nAn unfulfilled promise never made good.
Paathi,\n\nI am worried. Shola'mai does not wish to spread rumors, but Abbot Kulan-dro's behavior grows stranger by the day. He was late to midday meditation again, and muttered through the Tojay chant. This one knows it is forbidden to open his eyes during the mantras, but I could not help but take a peek. Kulan-dro's snout was twisted into a sneer, and his tail swept back and forth like a prayer bell. This alone would not raise Shola'mai's hackles—but his claws were tapping in time. They were clicking against the stone, again and again. It made this one's head swim!\n\nWe must send word to the Mane. I sense something dark in that rhythm. If the Abbot has bent, all of us are at risk.\n\nStay out of sight for the next few days, and if you hear the rhythm, flee the temple.\n\nMoons protect you,\nShola'mai
By the Red Asp, Hallin's Stand Thieves Guild\n\nWe Outlaws may not be very organized, but we have our ways of recognizing each other, no matter where we come from—our symbols, like the three-bladed dagger, or code phrases such as—actually, I don't think I'll write those down in a book. However, since we're all involved in the same illicit business, you'll see there's a common style to our arms and armor. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nOnce again, the key words for Outlaws' armor are speed and flexibility, which is why our greaves are mostly just straps and flaps. However, we often wear substantial poleyns over our knees, as much to ease crawling through tight spaces as to protect those joints in a fight.
By Forge-Wife Gurzbog gra-Gulog\n\nListen up, smiths! We don't pound hot metal around here just because it's fun. We forge for the glory of Malacath! Shoddy work will not be tolerated. You don't want to craft anything you'll have to apologize to the Orc-Father for when you get to the Ashpit. You want to make items in the Malacath Cult style? Well, there's only one right way to do it, and that's to use the Tilted Square, the symbol of instability. So pay attention! \n\nBOWS\n\nMelee, hand to hand and chest to chest, honors Malacath. Sticking an arrow in someone from a distance does not. For Malacath, a bow is a hunter's tool, not a warrior's weapon. So bows in the Malacath Cult style are lighter and simpler than the other weapons in our armory.

By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nThe Ra Gada or "Warrior Wave" of settlers from Yokuda actually occurred in four successive waves in the First Era's ninth century. This catalogue focuses on the second, or "Tavan" wave, so-called because it was spearheaded by the Hattu Metropoles brigade, which revered holy Tava, Lady of the Air. Thus the Tavans' arms and armor are replete with bird imagery. This second wave primarily settled on the southern coast of Hammerfell, and almost three millennia later their structures can still be found jutting from the coastal dunes. And one doesn't have to look far to see the influence of these ancient settlers on modern Redguard society. \n\nBOOTS\n\nRa Gadan boots are cobbled from heavy leather, usually camel hide, with thick soles as insulation against hot sand and stones. The traditional turned-up toes conceal metal caps to protect the soldier's vulnerable feet.
Daggerfall Covenant Arms and Armor\n\nBy General Baryctor Stelanie\n\nYes, we based the Daggerfall Covenant arms and armor on classic Second Empire designs, and we're unapologetic about it. In fact, we're proud! The Covenant represents the continuing ideals of Reman's Imperium, the uncontested height of Tamrielic civilization, when everyone, even the Orcs, were included in history's greatest confederation. Insofar as we seek to restore those lost glories, we deliberately hark back to them in our designs and symbolism.\n\nSTAVES\n\nWhen it comes to magic, it's the Bretons who are the most naturally talented of the Covenant allies, and the High Rock spellcasters are proud to wield staves tipped with the lion rampant of Emeric, our High King. The wrought-metal lion typically rears atop a facet-cut focusing crystal of some sort.
I heard a cat meeting Khiruna's description was nabbed by the Guard for cutting purses in the market, after the Iron Wheel hit but before we were set up in <<c:1>>.\n\nWord is, they were going to fine her and let her loose, but decided to turn her over to the Iron Wheel for more coin. (This is before the merchant lords decided <<2>> was bad for business.) Last I heard, she was loaded on a ship heading to <<3>>—nothing after that.\n\n—<<4>>
By Uraccanach the Witchman\n\nWould you live among the wild of the northern woods, and perhaps be wild yourself? Would you worship Hircine in his aspects of Alrabeg the Hunter, or Storihbeg the Skinchanger? Would you seek for the Beast Within, so it may be released to seek its blood prey? Then let your arms and armor bespeak these things of you, for at times your speech may be naught more than a growl. Hearken, Manbeast:\n\nHELMETS\n\nWhen the beasts look upon you, they will see another beast looking back, for your helm shall be a wolf's-head of steel. And this is as Storihbeg would have it, for the Manbeast within shall manifest without, and the hunter shall be exalted.
Sir or Madam,\n\nI do not understand why these small valuables have begun to show up at my doorstep, but I must say you have improved my standard of living substantially. What you ask for in return, however, is not within my power to give.\n\nIf I were to tell you, for example, about the caravan leaving my city along the northern trail at dawn a week from today, I think I would be in fear for my position. And informing you that each of the merchants of my city transport their safebox contents to the bank on the third day of every week would be a confidence I should not dare reveal.\n\nI trust we understand one another.\n\n—E
At-Addin Syndicate Memo: Outfitting the Abah's Landing Watch\n\nI just sold that Iron Wheel outfit a load of first-quality arms and armor—good enough that our own Abah's Landing guards are going to look shabby in comparison, and that's not going to do. We need to show a united front to the Wheel, with a standardized look to our guards. Based on what we've got in the warehouses, let's equip them as indicated below. \n\n—Merchant Lord Orahan at-Addin\n\nBOWS\n\nWe're arming town guards here: they don't need to shoot arrows at battlefield ranges, so there's no point in giving them powerful (and expensive) composite bows. Simple self bows will do fine—and as a matter of fact we just got a ship load of those from Velyn Harbor!
By Kari Coin-Counter\n\nDo you know what's a good way to waste money? …Actually, you probably know a lot of ways to waste money. Let me rephrase that: do you know a good way to save money? I'll tell you—buy in bulk, and have any manufactured goods made to specific standards. Economy: that's the reason Thieves Guild arms and armor need to follow the specifications below. \n\nSWORDS\n\nA thief doesn't really want to close with an opponent (except by surprise), so our Thieves Guild swords are broad, double-edged affairs made for slashing so as to keep an enemy at bay. As with the daggers, our flaring three-bladed Guild symbol provides a crossguard at the haft.
By Twilight Cantor Adara'hai\n\nSomewhere, deep in the Dark Behind the World, there are grim forges and bent benches where Lost Cats arm and armor themselves. On those dire times when they appear among us, their outfitting is much alike, implying they are made to certain standards. This one shall sing the song of these standards below. Because all knowledge is useful, no? If only to know what to stay away from. \n\nGLOVES\n\nGauntlets protect hands from blows, of course, but also it is cold, very cold in Dark Behind the World, so wear gloves. Fingertips are covered—where are Khajiiti claws? On forearm, blue claw marks, but on hands, no claws. Very disturbing.
Assassins League Style\nBy the Gray Maybe\n\nThe "Dark Brotherhood"? Utter nonsense. The Brotherhood is a myth. A legend. A lie. Death comes to us all, and murder is merely a matter of mundane craft—there's no need to invoke the Void, or its, ahem, mother. \n\nAh, but a secret society of assassins, a guild of killers for hire—now that makes sense. That's just good business. And like every good business, we have standards. You wish to join us, and dress like one of our league? Then follow the instructions below. And one day, if you are found worthy, you may be invited to learn some actual secrets. \n\nAXES\n\nThe hallmark of Assassins' weapons is that they are both nimble and effective, striving for that sweet spot between the heavy arms of soldiers and the supple but over-subtle weapons of duelists. Our axes, for example, feature a single, broad blade, with no more than a short slicing crescent on the backside for ripostes.
By Narsis Dren—Treasure Hunter\n\nSo, you want to be able to pass yourself off as a Draugr? That makes perfect sense! Done it myself, and more than once! Just follow my instructions below, and you'll have gear so Draugr-y not even a Dragon Priest's mother could tell it from the real thing! After all, if you're going to imitate my exploits recovering relics from ancient Nord tombs, in theory it will go much easier if it looks like you belong there! \n\nAnyway, that's the theory. \n\nHELMETS\n\nDon't get mere helmets, get full Nord helms that cover the entire head, and ideally have prominent horns. Don't skimp on this: the horned helm is very important to achieving that classic Draugr silhouette. Scar the leather parts with a cleaver, ding up the metal with a hammer, and rub rust and grave dirt into every surface.
To All Red Sails Captains,\n\nWhich one of you imbeciles thought it was a good idea to lure a pair of river trolls into my secret escape tunnel? Yes, they keep anyone from getting curious and wandering into the tunnel from the entry cave, but they also make it difficult for me to come and go as I please!\n\nThe last time I decided to sneak out of the castle, I had to toss an entire bucket full of roast ducks into the far corner or I would have never gotten past those dreadful beasts.\n\nNow, either come up with a method for me to safely avoid the trolls or get the damn creatures out of my tunnels! If they're still there the next time I need to use my secret passage, I'm going to lock the lot of you down there with them!\n\nFortunata ap Dugal
All Anvil Tax Collectors—READ NOW!\n\nI recently learned that some of you slow-wits are still charging the docking fees set by Count Ephrem, one-tenth of all gold exchanged for sales or purchases. In case you laggards forgot the recent sacking of Anvil, Count Ephrem isn't in charge of the docks any longer. Governor Fortunata runs these docks now, and you'll charge all vessels that make port and exchange cargo on my docks by her new fee—one-fifth.\n\nFor those of you simpletons who don't know what a fifth is, count your fingers and your thumb. Your thumb is a fifth, the amount you take, and your fingers are the rest. So when you see a stack of gold, take your thumb's worth or more, but never less. Anyone complains, you crack their heads open.\n\nIf there are too many for you to crack alone, you come tell me. We'll go to the ship in force and crack their heads together. No matter what, no ship leaves until its captain pays. If a ship does leave port without paying their taxes, the sentries assigned to keep her in port will pay her docking fees in thumbs and fingers.\n\nAlso, starting tomorrow, anyone I find collecting the old tax rate is spending a night in the sea cages.\n\nDockmaster Qamar
This one was, apparently, not clear enough in her directive against picking up travelers in passing, even if they offer gold! More travelers mean more attention, which is not a thing we seek. Some of the goods we transport are not held in the same high esteem as they are in our homeland. So much so that some of these good are considered to be illegal to possess. So this one doesn't care if your new friends "seem nice." If we are forced to answer the questions of the authorities, we will have plenty of time to grow to dislike one another while we spend time in the same cell.\n\nKhajiit are expected to express their regrets to their newfound friends and see they do not tag along when next we depart. Otherwise, this one will be forced to bare her claws upon your purses and reduce your cut of the profits accordingly.\n\nThis one assumes you understand now, yes?
By Chancellor Abnur Tharn\n\nThe ruination that came to the Ayleids was inevitable. It was not, as less astute scholars postulate, due to the will of the Aedra or some absurd mystical agent, but was a result of their degenerate Daedra worship and gross underestimation of their slaves. The human leaders who challenged the Ayleids, Saint Alessia in particular, recognized the cultural rot weakening their captors and took advantage of it to orchestrate one of the greatest triumphs of Men.\n\nThe debauched Elves were apparently quite creative when it came to devising new horrors to inflict on their slaves. It is no shock that practices such as "flesh-sculpture" would drive the tormented men and women of Cyrodiil to rebellion. In their smug complacency, the Elves could not conceive of the possibility of an uprising—which was well for the slaves, who would have been summarily crushed by the Ayleids at the height of their power.\n\nAs evidenced by the ruins found throughout Tamriel, the Ayleids were an incredible force. The source of their prodigious might, however, was also the catalyst of their decline. Deals with Daedric Princes granted them the power they sought. They thought themselves in control—typical Elven arrogance—as poison crept into their society. The various Daedric cults began bickering and backstabbing, as is their wont, forming the cracks the rebellion would exploit.\n\nAnother critical factor in the dissolution of Ayleid rule was the indomitable will of the oppressed. We have all read accounts of heroic deeds executed by the likes of Alessia, Morihaus, and Pelinal Whitestrake. While it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intellect that these tales are a bit hyperbolic, it is quite clear that exceptional individuals made the establishment of the First Empire possible.\n\nAlessia's Slave Army was populated with many examples of the true potential of Man. It is a pity that more texts have not survived, for the few we retain give us little insight, and dishonest scholars often distort them for slanderous political purposes. My own ancestor, "Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand," has been painted as either a slave-overseer or even implied to be identical to Tharhan, the Mutilant of the Gradual Massacre, based on ridiculous interpretations of obscure and questionable footnotes. The jealousy of lesser men, while I sometimes savor it, can be such an annoyance at times.\n\nIn reality, based on the rare texts I have had the privilege of consulting in the vaults of White-Gold itself, including the recently-discovered Scroll of Precursor Saints, Tharanus was a critical supporter of Alessia's cause, disrupting supply routes through forged logistical orders and even leading his own battalion into some of the war's bloodiest conflicts. Sadly, the slanderous have sunk so low as to make preposterous accusations that I forged the scroll myself. Despicable.\n\nGiven the weakness of the Ayleids and the inspiring members of Alessia's retinue, the outcome of the war was determined before the first slaver was beheaded. The Slave Rebellion both teaches a cautionary lesson about the idiocy of trifling with the Daedra and demonstrates the power of men, who have rightfully ruled the heart of Tamriel since. As they always shall.
By the Guardian of Stars\n\nAs above, so below. This was ever our creed. And thus, O Celestial below, as thou craftest thy arms and thy armor, thou shalt follow ever the guidance and model of ye Constellations that wheel above.\n\nCHESTS\n\nWho protecteth Nirn from roguish particles, ye ill from on high? The Aurora, curtain of light that wrappeth the globe in its folds. Like the Aurora thou shalt make thy cuirass, that it may wrap thee and ward thee particularly 'gainst weaponry.

GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE\nBy Chamberlain Haskill\n\nMy Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to create "Grim Harlequin" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than write manuals for mortals? \n\nActually, almost anything, now that I think about it. \n\nMACES\n\nThe Grim Harlequin mace head is a grinning skull (naturally) wearing a fool's cap, with a long extended tongue that wraps right 'round the top of the haft. It's quite cunning, really. If I were a mortal, I'd want both the one-handed and the two-handed versions. But I'm not.
DARK BROTHERHOOD STYLE\nBy Speaker Terenus\n\nHeed me, Initiates:  we are not soldiers, and do not wear a uniform—it would be a difficult thing indeed to do our jobs if we had to wear gear that identified us as members of an order of assassins. But just because we don't typically use uniforms when on assignment doesn't mean we don't have them: we do. When it is necessary for you to represent the Dark Brotherhood in a manner that leaves no doubt as to our involvement in an affair, you will wear guild armor and wield guild arms as described below. \n\nBELTS\n\nAn initiate's belt shall be leather that is broad and strong, to keep armor cinched tight and weapons secure. It shall display the Brotherhood's gray steel dart design, either toward the buckle or away from it. Hip tassets shall be broad and display the steel dart wrought large.

When it is necessary for you to represent the Dark Brotherhood in a manner that leaves no doubt as to our involvement in an affair, you will wear guild armor and wield guild arms as described below. \n\nMACES\n\nThe standard Brotherhood bludgeoning weapon is a square-headed warhammer, flanged on the corners for collateral laceration. The two-handed hammer is double headed, but the head on the one-handed variation is backed with a curved spike, useful as a tool for dragging cadavers into the shadows to hide them.

Upon the central boss shall be blazoned either the black or bloody hand.
By Nonus Caprenius, Temporarily Unaffiliated Scholar of Imperial Antiquities\n\nWould you do honor to the noble and all-but-forgotten race of Minotaurs, those mighty man-beasts who symbolized the Empire of yore? Do you believe in the legends of their greatness, as I do? Listen, then, and I shall teach you how to craft a set of arms and armor that will pay appropriate tribute to these nigh-extinct avatars of ancient Alessia! \n\nMACES\n\nThe Minotaur's mace sports a heavy cylindrical head studded with sharp rivets. These heads are often lead-filled when wielded by the mighty man-bulls, but ordinary mortals find that too unwieldy, and instead settle for mere iron or steel. The two-handed version features an iron spike on the butt end.
Esteemed Marshal,\n\nThe last group of prisoners you sent me to work my fields have proven less resilient than I'd hoped. They are, without exception, lazy, slow, and dull-witted. Then again, no one ever said Bretons and Bosmer make good slaves. I miss the days when you could buy a dozen strong Argonians for the price of a sturdy wagon.\n\nAs soon as possible, I'd like a few of those strong Nords you sent over to Kharekh. As she and I have both agreed to your "work for compensation" plan, we both deserve an equal share of the resources. I refuse to settle for lower quality workers. Send me only your strongest and brightest.\n\nI have it on good authority that a group of Nords will be traveling through Suran soon on a trading mission. If you manage to arrest one or two, I'd be happy to take them off your hands. Until then, I remain your friend and confidant.\n\nMistress Dren
Do not tempt the Daedra Lords with restlessness. Give to them freely as our ancestors did so that their dire gazes do not fall upon our tribe. It is best to offer the Princes their rightful due when the seasons show us their brief favor, lest they call upon us in the lean times. You will know the portents by the fatness of the guar, you will know it by the stench of the sea on the inland, and you will know it by the wanderings of the lost peoples along their false gods' paths.\n\nLead the tribe to great Almurbalarammi, for that is where the ancestors made their pact and so it will be there that the pact is renewed. Upon arrival, alight a pyre of grain. It must be fed until the ritual has concluded. There will be no full bellies until the Princes have had their fill.\n\nEach day, as the sun crests the distant waves, gather the living sacrifice at our ancient altar in Almurbalarammi. Split their throats over the stone with the black glass blade and invoke the Daedra Lords while the blood is still fresh. Spurn not one, or our suffering will be assured and terrible.\n\nSpread the sacrificial entrails to the far corners of the altar before the sun reaches its true height and leave the offering to the Princes' mercy. When the host of Namira and touch of Peryite have befouled the corpse, you will know the day's feast is concluded.\n\nAttendants may remove the offering and wash the altar with the oils of anointment. On the day of longest dusk, Azura signals that our offerings are satisfactory to the Daedra Lords. Only then may we break our fast and cease our supplication. Do not tarry in Almurbalarammi, for it is their place.

By Midar Nelvilo\n\nGive a baby alit a chunk of meat, and he'll be fed for an hour. Teach a baby alit to find its own meat and you'll be dead in a week.\n\nDark Elves are like volcanos—gray, ornery, and filled with red goo.\n\nNever tell a nix-hound that it's ugly. It doesn't speak Cyrodilic, and it won't understand what you're saying. You're just wasting your time.\n\nThe only road worth traveling is the road that's not made of lava.\n\nWhen you set the table, always leave out one glass for a friend. If they don't show, you can drink two drinks at once.\n\nIt's good to be rich, but it's even better to be really, really rich.\n\nIf you want to murder someone, use a Dunmeri knife. If you want to spread butter, also use a Dunmeri knife. Dark Elves make great knives.\n\nNo mushroom is ever so tall as the mushroom that grows the tallest.\n\nIf I was a guar and someone tried to ride me, I'd buck them off! Then I'd try to find a witch who could turn me back into a person.\n\nLife is like a cliff racer—it flies right by and it stinks.\n\nIf someone asks you why you drink so much, just tell them you lost your wife recently. If they ask how, tell them she fell into one of the wine bottles and you're trying to find her.\n\nThe mer who chases two guars at once will get really, really tired and probably shouldn't be a guar farmer.\n\nWhen life offers you sour figs, just eat them right away. That'll show life.\n\nYou can teach a guar to dance, but it'll still look really stupid.\n\nA wise mer never turns his back on a Telvanni wizard … unless there's a Telvanni wizard behind him. Then things get weird.\n\nNever talk about how stupid the Tribunal is. Wait, are you writing this down?\n\nKhajiit make the best wives. They drink a lot, sleep a lot, and don't live very long.\n\nNever test the temper of a one-eyed Orc. It's the only test he'll always pass.\n\nIf you ask the Tribunal for rain, you'll get a flood. That's why constipated Dark Elves never pray.\n\nIf Almalexia tells you to jump, you jump. If Sotha Sil tells you to jump, you don't jump, because Sotha Sil never tells anyone to do anything. If Vivec tells you to jump, you take a moment to think, because he probably wants you to paint a three-legged horse or something.\n\nSome days you're the bull and some days you're the betty. But either way, you're still a giant tentacle monster.\n\nI love mudcrabs. They taste great and they never tell you what they think.\n\nDrinking alone is like drinking with friends, just with less people.
My Red Exiles,\n\nI need you to infiltrate the mine outside Balmora and recover an item of great importance to our venerated cause and to the elevation of Ashlanders everywhere. Currently, this item resides in the possession of the Nycotic cult, who plan to conduct a ritual in the mine to grant the item the ability to channel unfathomable power. Let the cultists begin the process, but acquire the item before they complete the ritual.\n\nThe item lies in one of the deep chambers of the mine, most likely heavily guarded. Sneak in and steal the item. It has the appearance of a staff made of metal and gears. It is necessary to advance to the next stage of our cherished cause.\n\nGet the staff and bring it to me, and you will be one step closer to ending your exile and returning to the fold.\n\nCC

1. The tonal inverter requires two willing, consenting, adults to operate; one harmonic modulator to generate and prepare the sound wave, one resonance intonator to release the prepared sound wave and disrupt Sotha Sil's modified energy-stealing device.\n\n2. Harmonic modulator operates the tonal inverter, nearby but out of direct combat, while resonance intonator engages device-wielder in battle.\n\n3. Harmonic modulator works the tonal inverter controls to build a wave of sonic energy.\n\n4. When the tonal inverter reaches the proper pitch, harmonic modulator indicates the device is ready for discharge. For example, the harmonic modulator could shout: "Ready!"\n\n5. Resonance intonator pauses in combat long enough to discharge the tonal inverter. Note: This can be done from anywhere within a clear line of sight, as the tonal inverter has been configured to recognize and obey the resonance intonator from a remote position.\n\n6. Tonal inverter releases a charge that temporarily disrupts the energy emitted by Sotha Sil's modified device. The wielder of said device will become vulnerable to attack for a limited amount of time.\n\nFinal Words: Depending on the amount of energy already absorbed by the wielder of Sotha Sil's device, this procedure may need to be repeated multiple times, as the disruption and subsequent vulnerability is fleeting. Stick with it and everything should turn out fine. May the Great Gear whir and spin freely in your presence!
Your shrouding of the light proved a great boon to our holy plans. We led the pirate ship into the rocks and freed those unjustly imprisoned. The drugged guards slept through it all, just as we ordained.\n\nDo not be concerned over the loss of life. The innocent survived and the wicked perished. Look upon your just reward, included with this message, and be at peace.\n\nYou shall know us by this phrase:\n\n"The ending of the words is ALMSIVI."
By Bathed-in-Steel, First Armorer of Stormhold\n\nFirst of all, a warning: do not be so careless as to allow these instructions to fall into the wrong hands! If the authorities in Stormhold knew I was hiring out-of-work smiths to create arms and armor for the Silken Ring, my head would soon be adorning a pike on the Big Bridge! \n\nSecond of all: follow these instructions to the letter. You don't want a secret society of assassins irritated at you because you made them squeaky boots. Pay attention, hatchling, and we'll all profit.\n\nBELTS\n\nThe Silken Ring prefer their belts to be woven from leather or silk to allow for greater flexibility and fastened by a sturdy silver buckle. The large buckle must include a hidden compartment and unfasten quickly using only one hand.

Pay attention, hatchling, and we'll all profit.\n\nSTAVES\n\nAs you might have guessed, harnessing the Destruction school is of greatest interest to the Silken Ring. The staff heads will be spear-like but blunt, and sprouting curls of silver similar to the embossing found throughout their designs. Why it isn't a literal spearhead, I don't know, but I'm not the mage here.

Long serrated curves along the blade are more visually intimidating than functional, but they'll split a neck cleanly all the same.
By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nThe Breton passion for feudal hierarchy pervades every aspect of High Rock society, from the lowliest peasant farmer to the High King in Wayrest. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the curious phenomenon of the Breton knightly orders. \n\nHere in Hammerfell, we Redguards sensibly award equal citizenship to every man or woman who knows which end of the sword to grasp. Oh, we have our governing class, of course, as civilization must be ordered and maintained, but below this aristocracy there are few distinctions. \n\nNot so in High Rock, where everyone is aware of their degree of nobility, which is invariably traced back to those Breton families who led the region's liberation from the overlordship of the Direnni Elves. High Rock cultural history is founded on tales of the noble and chivalrous "Breton Knights" who flung off the yoke of their Elven masters. After these knights drove the Direnni back to Balfiera Island, they founded the knightly orders to carry on the tradition of nobles-in-arms, and to ensure that High Rock would have able and ready defenders in times of trouble. \n\nSo the stories go, at least. Today, every petty kingdom and duchy in High Rock has its own knightly order, with traditions that supposedly date back to the glory days of the Breton Liberation. The Knights of the Dragon in Daggerfall, the Knights of the Flame in Alcaire, the Order of Saint Pelin in Evermore—the list goes on and on. \n\nAnd what, nowadays, do these knightly orders do to justify their gleaming greatswords and shining mail? If we look beyond the banners and pageantry, we find that the chivalric orders fulfill two main purposes in High Rock society. \n\nFirst, they provide an acceptably "noble" calling for the excess sons and daughters of the aristocracy. Over time, as trade has made High Rock prosperous, the profession of merchant has become an accepted alternative to feudal lordship for the children of the nobility, but frankly, not every baron's son has a head for numbers and negotiation. For these spare heirs, there's always a membership available in the local knightly order. \n\nSecond, the bestowal of a knighthood on a lower-class man or woman is a convenient way to reward outstanding contributions to society (or to the elevating lord), and confers a measure of that nobility so prized in Breton society. Where the commoner is rewarded for achievements other than in conflict—and this is the case in the majority of knighthoods—the membership in the local knightly order is only nominal, and the new sir or dame is not expected to take up sword and shield. However, if their achievements were in the all-important realm of trade, the new "merchant knight" is expected to contribute heavily and regularly to the order's financial maintenance. \n\nSo if you're visiting Wayrest or Evermore on a mission of diplomacy or trade, don't be surprised if the head of a shipping company is introduced as Sir Doric, or the owner of a string of hostels is called Dame Lizabette. You're simply meeting one of the fabled Breton Knights of High Rock.
By Abbot Durak\n\nThose new to our order often ask me, "What does it mean to be a Spirit Warden?" This confusion is understandable. Azura offers guidance, but not always in the ways we expect. She has spoken to me but twice in my lifetime, and then only in silken whispers, barely audible in the night.\n\nThe Dream Shard is Azura's gift, as is the Dreamless Potion we drink every night. Azura foresees a time when Vaermina, Mistress of Nightmares, will unleash a plague on our province: a plague of madness. Countless innocents will die unless we stop it.\n\nThe Dreamless Potion protects us from Vaermina's madness only so we may protect others: those afflicted souls driven mad by their dreams, and their victims. When the time of plague comes, we must stand against it. This is our calling from Azura … and our pledge.
Let no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, nor the Ancient Offices observed.\n\nThe Ritual of the Innocent Quarry, also called the Great Hunt, is an ancient rite drawing magical energy from the powerful magicka stream that engulfs this realm. The creators and times of the rituals are long forgotten. But followed properly, the rite brings great power and prestige to the Huntsman.\n\nThe ritual pits the all-powerful Huntsmen and their Greater and Lesser Dogs against the pitiful and doomed Innocent Quarry, called by tradition the Hare, after the mortal creature of human hunts. At once, the Huntsman is transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry. In the highest aesthetic realization of the ritual, the ecstatic rapture of the kill is balanced by the Huntsman's identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry. As in pieces the body of the innocent Hare is torn, the Huntsman reflects on the tragic imbalances of power and the cruel injustices of the world.\n\nAs the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsmen, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsmen, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and recites the Offices of the Hunt. The Offices describe the laws and conditions of the four stages of the Hunt: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View to the Kill.\n\nStage One: The Drag, in which the Lesser Dogs drag the ground to flush out the Hare.\n\nStage Two: The Chase, in which the Greater Hounds drive the Hare before them.\n\nStage Three: The Call, in which the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsmen for the kill.\n\nStage Four: The View, in which the Huntsman makes the kill with the ritual Spear of Bitter Mercy, and calls upon the Master of the Hunt to view the kill by ringing the town bell. The Master of the Hunt then bestows the Bounty upon the Huntsman Bold who has wielded the Spear of Bitter Mercy in the kill. The Master of the Hunt also calls upon the Huntsman Bold to name the next Hare for the next Hunt (though the Huntsman Bold himself may not participate in the next Hunt).\n\nThe Offices of the Hunt, which the Huntsmen, Master, and Hounds are solemnly sworn to honor, detail the practices and conditions of the Hunt. These practices and conditions, also known as the Law, strictly define all details of the Hunt, such as how many Hounds of each sort may participate, how the Spear of Bitter Mercy may be wielded, and so forth. In addition, the Law states that the Hare must have a genuine chance to escape the Hunt, no matter how slim. In practice, this condition has been defined as the availability of six keys which, if gathered together in the Temple of Daedric Rites, permit the Hare to teleport away from the Hunt, and so elude the Huntsman and his Spear. It is inconceivable, of course, that the Hare might actually discover the keys and escape, but the forms must be observed, and tampering with the keys or cheating the Hare of a genuine chance of finding or using the keys is a shameful and unforgivable betrayal of the Law of the Hunt.
By Lady Clarisse Laurent\n\nIt is strange that the Elven ruins known as Salas En, on the Hammerfell coast at Cape Shira, have never been properly explored or studied. This is most likely due to the superstitious locals' exaggerated reverence for burial grounds of the dead, even those of other cultures. I wouldn't go so far as to accuse the Alik'r Redguards of timidity, but really, having to bring all my own people over the bay from High Rock is a bit much. \n\nIn any event, now that we are on our way, we shall do the job right. The known facts about Salas En are few, but they are fascinating, as it has been inhabited over the last three eras by a series of cultures. On top—which makes it most recent, of course—are Redguard relics dating from the First-Era occupation of Salas En by Crowns of the late Ra Gada. Colonists from the island of Yath in lost Yokuda, these Redguards seem to have displaced the Elves who previously occupied the site. It appears these descendants of Yath occupied Salas En until abandoning it in the middle 23rd century, which coincides with the ravages of the Thrassian Plague. \n\nThe Elves the Yath Redguards displaced were, according to tradition, relatively recent Altmeri colonists of the Corelanya clan, who were said to be Daedra-worshipers. (This would account for their emigration from Summerset to the austere shores of Hammerfell.) They seem to have arrived sometime in the sixth century 1E, inhabiting and expanding on structures originally built by the Ayleids. Bosmeri relics are intermixed here with classic high-period Altmeri, suggesting that either the Corelanya participated in the Wood Elf coastal trade, then at its historic height, or that Salas En was used as a stopover by Bosmeri merchants before the Corelanya arrived. \n\nBelow these High Elf additions—and indeed, still standing with less wear on them than any of the structures built afterward—are the original Ayleid stoneworks, jutting proudly toward the heavens despite the passage of millennia. The Ayleid Elves who built Salas En are virtually unknown to history, and it is primarily to reveal their story that I have organized this expedition. With the assistance of my experienced and hand-picked team of excavators, I have every confidence that we can persuade the stones of Salas En to reveal their secrets to us.
By the intercession of St. Alessia, you may be so filled with grace, and the strength and wisdom that come from grace, that through these teachings you may come to the true meaning of the Eight Divines and Their glories. To convey to man's mind all the manifold subtleties of truth and virtue may not be done, were all the seas ink, and all the skies the parchment upon which Their wisdoms were writ. Yet Akatosh, in His wisdom, knowing how impatient is man, and how loath he is to travel upon the hard roads of truth, has allowed these nine simple commands to be made manifest with powerful clarity and concise definition.\n\n1. Stendarr says: Be kind and generous to the people of Tamriel. Protect the weak, heal the sick, and give to the needy.\n\n2. Arkay says: Honor the earth, its creatures, and the spirits, living and dead. Guard and tend the bounties of the mortal world, and do not profane the spirits of the dead.\n\n3. Mara says: Live soberly and peacefully. Honor your parents, and preserve the peace and security of home and family.\n\n4. Zenithar says: Work hard, and you will be rewarded. Spend wisely, and you will be comfortable. Never steal, or you will be punished.\n\n5. Kynareth says: Use Nature's gifts wisely. Respect her power, and fear her fury.\n\n6. Dibella says: Open your heart to the noble secrets of art and love. Treasure the gifts of friendship. Seek joy and inspiration in the mysteries of love.\n\n7. Julianos says: Know the truth. Observe the law. When in doubt, seek wisdom from the wise.\n\n8. Akatosh says: Serve and obey your Emperor. Study the Covenants. Worship the Eight, do your duty, and heed the commands of the saints and priests.\n\n9. The Eight say: Above all else, be good to one another.\n\nIf only each man might look into the mirror of these Commands, and see reflected there the bliss that might enfold them, were he to serve in strict obedience to these Commands, he would be cast down and made contrite and humble. The obedient man may come to the altars of the Eight and be blessed, and may receive the comfort and healing of the Eight, and may give thanks for his manifold blessings.\n\nHeedless, the wicked man turns away, and forsaking the simple wisdoms granted to him by the All-Wise and All-Knowing Eight, he lives in sin and ignorance all the days of his life. He bears the awful burden of his crimes, and before Men and God his wickedness is known, and neither blessing nor comfort may he expect from the altars and shrines of the Eight.\n\nYet the wicked and foolish are not doomed, for in their infinite mercies, the Eight have said, "Repent, and do Good Works, and the Fountains of Grace shall once more spill forth upon you."\n\nRepent your crimes! Tender unto the Emperor the fines of gold, that they may be used to spread the Faith and its Benefits to all Men!\n\nDo yourself good works! Redeem your infamy by shining deeds! Show to all Men and the Eight the good Fame of the Righteous Man, and you may once again approach the altars and shrines of the Chapel to receive the comfort and blessings of the Eight.
Who is ALMSIVI?\n\nMorrowind is holy country, and its gods are flesh and blood. Collectively, these gods are called the Tribunal, the triune ALMSIVI, three deities exemplifying Dunmeri virtues. Almalexia is Mercy, Vivec is Mastery, and Sotha Sil is Mystery. Vivec is easily the most popular of them all. Vivec is also the most public, for he is the beloved Warrior-Poet of the True People, paradoxically beautiful and bloody. Vivec is an artistic violence. Vivec is represented in Temple literature and liturgy as one of the divine kings of Morrowind. He guards the sacred Velothi subcontinent of Vvardenfell, and stands guard over Red Mountain. He is part of the holy Tribunal, a god of the New Temple, and an aspect of the blessed and righteous ALMSIVI.\n\nThis explicit presentation of Vivec the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to Westerners. However, it is important to remember that Vivec is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the Daedra that anticipated him, Black Hands Mephala, a foundation figure of the earliest Chimer. This darker side of Vivec does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of Vivec's divine aspect. A more complete appreciation of the complex nature of Vivec requires an understanding of the nature of Vivec's Anticipation, Mephala, and the darker themes represented by this Daedra Lord's modes and motivations.\n\nWho is Mephala?\n\nEach of the three Tribunes of the Temple were represented in the dawn of Chimeri culture by their Anticipations. These Anticipations are known to the West as the sinister Daedra Lords Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. In Temple theology, however, Azura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, the Mage-Lord of Almsivi. Boethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia, Almsivi's Mother and Lady. Mephala is the Anticipation of Vivec. According to legend, under the guidance of these three Daedra Lords, a discontented throng of Altmer transformed themselves into a new people and founded a new land. And while Boethiah, the so-called Prince of Plots, provided the revolutionary methods needed to bring about this transformation, Mephala was the shadowy implementer of those methods.\n\nAs known in the West, Mephala is the demon of murder, sex, and secrets. All of these themes contain subtle aspects and violent ones (assassination/genocide, courtship/orgy, tact/poetic truths); Mephala is understood paradoxically to contain and integrate these contradictory themes. And all these subtle undercurrents and contradictions are present in the Dunmer concepts of Vivec, even if they are not explicitly described and explained in Temple doctrine.\n\nThe Dunmer do not envision Lord Vivec as a creature of murder, sex, and secrets. Rather, they conceive of Lord Vivec as benevolent king, guardian warrior, poet-artist. But, at the same time, unconsciously, they accept the notion of darker, hidden currents beneath Vivec's benevolent aspects.\n\nFor example, one of the most striking persistent myths associated with Vivec is the story that Vivec conspired with his co-rulers Almalexia and Sotha Sil in the murder of Lord Nerevar, the greatest of Dunmer heroes and generals. The story is derived from Ashlander oral tradition, and is flatly contradicted by all Temple traditions. Nonetheless, the tale is firmly established in the Dunmer imagination, as if to say, "Of course Vivec would never have conspired to murder Lord Nerevar, but it happened so long ago … who can know the truth?"\n\nThe public face of Vivec is benign, sensitive, compassionate, and protective of his followers. At the same time, the Dunmer seem irrationally comfortable with the hidden aspects of Vivec, the darker components of violence, lust, and conspiracy associated with the more primitive and ruthless impulses of the Anticipations.
Civility and Etiquette Volume III: Wood Orcs, Part I\n\nElden Hollow\n\nBy Coristir, Sage Sojourner\n\nIt is said that the Orcs came to be when the Aldmeri god, Trinimac, was devoured by the Daedric Prince Boethiah. As the myth goes, Boethiah excreted Trinimac's remains, and those Aldmer who followed Trinimac rubbed that excrement on themselves to become Orcs. Perhaps it's just a myth, but the imagery is appropriate: repugnant, ridiculous, and a little comical, like the Orcs themselves. It's said that, after a time, a sect of these people traveled into Valenwood and developed a tangential culture: the Wood Orcs. (For dealings with Orsinium Orcs, see Volume II.)\n\nThe Orcs in general are difficult for Mer to interact with, but these Wood Orcs are similar in physicality to our Wood Elf cousins, the Bosmer. The Wood Orcs are blunter and more ill-tempered than the Bosmer, but should be handled in much the same way: with patience, guidance, and a careful eye. Without a proper Altmeri hand to lead them, both races have the potential to devolve into self-destructive, orderless savages that are an inconvenience and danger to all civilized people around them. \n\nSo how should an Altmer deal with a Wood Orc?\n\nFirst, earn her respect. Like her northern, Orsinium cousins (the more common Orc variety), a Wood Orc admires physical strength, but she also prizes agility, speed, and geographical knowledge (equating that with tactical knowledge). Display some semblance of competence in these areas and you will earn her begrudging appreciation.\n\nHere are a few ways to begin a conversation (as a sign of respect, make sure to introduce yourself or at least establish eye contact first):\n\n1.	Offer to begin an unarmed altercation and force the Wood Orc to submit. They enjoy fisticuffs.\n\n2.	If you find yourself walking with a Wood Orc, gain the lead and maintain it. This may lead to a footrace. Win it, and win the Wood Orc's approval.\n\n3.	Find a large rock—equal to or greater than body size—and hurl it, within view. Use a strength spell if you must, but don't let the Wood Orc know.\n\nIf you think this sounds like impressing your way into a tribe of athletic children, you would not be far wrong. Use the above methods with caution—predictable as they may be, Wood Orcs are individuals, and require improvisation in dealing with them.\n\nAnd here are a few things an Altmer should not do when interacting with Wood Orcs:\n\n1.	Flaunt magical abilities. Though the Altmer know that displaying advanced magic shows a lifetime of dedication and mastery of the highest craft, all Orcs bear a cultural distrust of magic. In their ignorance, they believe magic's primary function is oppression of their people, and often bridle at its use.\n\n2.	Unless you're intending to ignite a battle, never hide in the trees of Wood Orc territory. Walk in the open. As our Bosmer cousins have learned, the Wood Orcs do not take kindly to those who stalk their forests. They equate secret movement with malevolence and cowardice.\n\nIn Part II of this collection, I'll detail specific hurdles that may come up in conversation with a Wood Orc, such as religion and Malacath, and the Wood Orc equivalent of Orsinium strongholds.
The Keeper's Primer Volume II: The Binding Stone\n\nFrom the Office of the Canonreeve of Corrections\n\nAltmeri texts reference many variations of the entrapment spell. Some of those spells, like the early First Era "Aninaire's Tower," create physical fields around their targets. These varieties are unbreachable unless broken by an appropriate amount of force—like conjured stone walls, or shield wards turned inward. The effect differs in strength from spell to spell, but is generally effective for containing the layman prisoner, and certainly tougher to break free from than brick and mortar.\n\nOf course, sometimes a mage seeks to confine creatures that walls won't hold, magical or otherwise. Gaseous forms of the Wild Hunt, Nether Liches, and various ghosts and phantoms all have means to escape physical barriers. These must be imprisoned using spells that create completely impermeable surfaces while absorbing or stemming the magicka of their captives. These spells must be re-incanted constantly to avoid consuming themselves, usually at a high cost of magicka for the caster.\n\nThe Binding Stone, which your Head Keeper will soon introduce to you if he hasn't already, functions as a combination of these spells. It's tangible, small, and therefore portable, but capable of holding all manner of magicka-wielding creatures—even ones as powerful as your charge.\nI'm sure you understand the grave nature of what the prisoner's escape would mean, both to you, personally, and to Auridon and Tamriel as a whole. The condition of the Binding Stone is more important than the condition of your prisoner. Indeed, your very lives depend on the upkeep and maintenance of the Stone.\n\nAnd as for your prisoner: do not look at him. Do not speak to him. There is no specific danger in doing so, but any such interaction is a fruitless venture. Watch yourself, watch each other, do your duty, and your name will live forever among those who have committed everything to shield Auridon from his menace.
Who took up their arms that winter dawn,\nWho to Glenumbria came\nTo raise their hand,\n'Gainst tyrants stand\nAnd to die in freedom's name?\nWho stood on the field upon that hour,\nWho answered Direnni's call?\nMen Breton-born all came that morn\nTo defend the land for all.\n\nCHORUS:\nRise, rise to freedom rise,\nArise ye Breton sons and daughters!\nRide, ride to freedom ride,\nTruth and glory to the brave!\nAnd when the battle it was joined\nAlessians three to one,\nThe sky lit bright\nWith magic's light\nAnd with magic it was won.\n\nFor all they stood on blessed ground\nWhence all her power came\nThe rocks would yield\nWhat might they wield\nAll in Direnni's name.\n\nCHORUS REPRISE\n\nSo children of this Breton land\nYe best remember well\nAll those who for High Rock stood\nBrian, Ancois, Rielle;\nMen of the north,\nAll who stood forth\nTill all oppressors fell.
Collected by Telenger the Artificer\n\nVulkwasten, widely known for its fermented beverages, is home to some of the friendliest Bosmer I've ever met. Like most of their kind, they are industrious and get along well with most people. After completing research into their brewing methods, I stayed overnight with a local family.\n\nAs a historian, I realize one can learn much about a culture by studying its humor. Therefore, I copied down several of their witticisms for future examination. Perhaps by considering their amusements, we will gain further insight into the mind of the Bosmer.\n\nA skeleton walks into the tavern and says, "I'd like some rotmeth. And a mop."\n\nQ: Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?\nA: It was dead.\n\nQ. What's brown and sticky?\nA. A stick.\n\nPerson One: Ask me if I'm a tree.\nPerson Two: Are you a tree?\nPerson One: No.\n\nQ. Which side of a raven has the most feathers?\nA. The outside.\n\nQ. What has three heads, is ugly, and smells?\nA. My mistake! You don't have three heads!\n\nQ. What's light as a feather, but cannot be held for very long?\nA. Breath.\n\nQ. Imagine your boat's sinking in slaughterfish-infested waters. How do you survive?\nA. Stop imagining!\n\nQ. Why do thunderbugs eat raw meat?\nA. They never learned to cook.\n\nQ. Why do bees buzz?\nA. Because they can't whistle.
A Summary\n\nBy Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination\n\nThe kingdoms of the Daggerfall Covenant are inhabited by mongrel upstarts who have cruelly suppressed our Direnni cousins: the High Elves who are the rightful rulers of northwest Tamriel. They were largely complicit in the rise of the dangerous and genocidal fanatics known as the Alessian Order. They allow their pirates to prey on Aldmeri shipping. The Bretons are also so indiscriminate that they have accepted the bestial Orsimer as allies. (Orsimer! Can you imagine?) Though capable of mustering substantial brute force, there is no evidence that these degraded hybrids have the wisdom or learning to deal with the mystical disaster now threatening the Mundus. They must be disciplined and subdued as rapidly as possible, so the Dominion can get on with the business of saving the world … and protecting it in the future.
By Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination\n\nLoyal citizen of the Isles, heed the statement of the Thalmor. Bear witness to these words about our new allies, the Khajiit and the Wood Elves.\n\nIntegration with our new Wood Elf and Khajiiti allies continues apace. To promote Alliance harmony, loyal Thalmor agents have drawn together this short list of helpful notices. Follow this mandatory guidance with cheer, and our new allies will look on you with favor.\n\n— Do not refer to Khajiit as "cats," "kitties," "fuzzies," or any other derogatory feline-based term.\n\n— Khajiiti delicacies are often very sweet, or spiced with the exotic substance known as moon-sugar. Diners beware.\n\n— Do not touch a Khajiit's tail without permission.\n\n— Our Khajiiti allies have a unique dialect. Mocking their speech, or imitating it, is considered quite rude and non-Aldmeri.\n\n— When inviting a Wood Elf to dine, know that the resources of the forest are sacred to them. Serve venison, but no salads.\n\n— Do not refer to Wood Elves as "shorties," "runties," or any other derogatory height-based terms.\n\n— Have a care when imbibing Wood Elf brews, as their beverages are very different than our own.\n\n— Do not imply to Wood Elves that they are cannibals, or ask them about how they dispose of their dead.\n\nEagles, Unite!
(excerpts)\n\nAll things to the Tree\n\nFrom the Tree, all things\n\n— Ayleid prophecy\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nLet this be your first lesson: the roots of the First Tree grasp all the ground on which you stand. When the rains and wind come, it will be the roots that hold you firm. Under the roots lies Nirn, and over her boughs shines Aetherius. She provides both floor and roof. You need no other shelter.\n\n *  *  *  *  *\n\nAzra Root grows along the banks of the slow-moving rivers. Pull it gently free of the mud and wrap the roots in a damp cloth. Thus the plant may be transported. These will take root in pots and baskets of moss, if they are kept moist enough.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nWhen the Saliache Elves first came to the Elden Root, they were led to it by Meridia's shining colors, which told them this was her gift and blessing. The Tree's branches and roots are as hands, reaching at once into the Mundus and Overworld. On this, we built Mundus' greatest city and prove ourselves her highest and most honored race.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nIn the heat of the summer, shroud the leaves of the Alocasia in silk. The fruit will grow larger and sweeter if the growing process is thus slowed. It is said Y'ffre took its fallen fruit as tribute.\n\nThe Alomeria plant is related to this, but will not bear fruit. You may know it as Water Hyacinth.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nWhen they arrived, they said, "This is the Grove of the One Great Tree. This is the Grove of the Sages, the Elden Grove. We brought with us life and knowledge, and in the shade of the Great Tree, we build the classrooms and libraries, so that we would make a harvest of our legacy of intellect."\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nThe seed of the Nirnroot may be carried great distances by birds and other creatures. Near the Great Tree, the fronds grow tall and lush. Farther away, they may grow reedier and less hardy.\n\nLet this likewise be a lesson.
By Coristir\n\nPart I\n\nIt is popular belief that all undead and phantasmal revenants are slaves to their necromantic biology. Indeed, like most predatory wildlife, many of these creatures exist only to absorb or consume the energy of the living. They should never be bargained or reasoned with. An Altmer should deal with such creatures in the way she would handle a rabid wolf, or malevolent Orc: with extreme prejudice.\n\nHowever, there are those among the post-living that possess or have achieved sentience, like vampires, liches, and wraiths. Dialogue is possible with creatures such as these, as long as one keeps certain discretions in mind:\n\n1.	An undead who speaks is bound to be powerful. Any creature whose magic is potent enough to allow it sentience in death deserves an Altmer's begrudging admiration.\n\n2.	An undead can never be trusted. Though we should respect the undead and their power, all undead want something from the living, and there is little to stop them from taking it. An Altmer must remain guarded in their presence. Always.\n\n3.	An undead might not be as she appears. Many powerful mages possess illusory spells to alter their appearance, and so, too, do the undead. The wandering spirit of a lost child could be a starving lich in disguise.\n\nThat said, there is much an Altmer can learn from the accumulated knowledge of a sentient undead, if dialogue can be achieved. The discerning Altmer could learn of ancient spells from time immemorial, firsthand accounts of historical events, or the locations of lost relics—if said Altmer can pose salient questions. When conversing with the likes of the undead, an Altmer wants to maintain an appearance of:\n\n1.	Humility. An Altmer's heritage should afford her much, and in an ideal world, all peoples, including liches, vampires, and wraiths, would adhere to the Altmeri concept of class and proceed accordingly. However, most undead, even Altmeri undead, rarely adhere to social conventions. As such, even the most well-bred of Altmer should refer to point 1 in the previous listing. Think of the undead as elders: powerful, unflinching, and prone to anger.\n\n2.	Intelligence. As is true with the Altmer, especially well-bred Altmer, the undead do not suffer fools. Without being overtly obvious, an Altmer wants to seek openings to display magical acumen or cunning to show that she is not to be trifled with. Again, think of intimidating a stern elder into compliance.\n\n3.	Discipline. Assuming an Altmer can enter into peaceful communication with a lich, wraith, vampire, or otherwise, she will undoubtedly have many questions. But she should be wary of the number of questions she asks. An undead will impart its knowledge willingly or not at all.\n\nIn Part II of this collection, I'll detail hurdles that may come up in conversation with the undead, specifically with wraiths, vampires, and liches, all of which require different operations of social intelligence.
Hail Undaunted,\n\nYou've earned the privilege of joining our next expedition for fortune and glory, our leads are pointing to the Jerall Mountains!\n\nNords have been fleeing their villages in southern Skyrim. Raiders from the Colovian Highlands have been razing their homes and kidnapping their kin. Many have taken refuge in the town of Falkreath, but no word has come from the hold in recent days.\n\nRumor has it that the invaders have a stronghold in the mountains where they've been taking their captives. Of course no one has actually seen it, but we know there are a lot of old Nedic ruins in the area. There could be something to the talk.\n\nScout out the Jerall Mountains and Falkreath for any signs of these marauders. If there really is an army of bloodthirsty monsters wreaking havoc out there, we want to know about it!\n\n-Urgarlag Chief-bane
By Sannemmu Khamishi, Wise Woman of the Erabenimsun Tribe\n\nSo, Clanfriend, you are curious about our clothing? You wonder how such simple, nomadic barbarians can come to have such elaborate and sophisticated garments and tools? Then learn this: for the Ashlander, simplicity is a choice, not a necessity. We follow the precepts of the Good Daedra, and our practices and preferences are in accord with their teachings. We have other, deeper secrets which I will not reveal now, but the making of our apparel and arms are not among them. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nLike our cuirasses, Ashlander greaves are made of bands of guar leather sewn together with waxed and twisted thread made of kresh or roobrush fibers. Chitin or carapace poleyns may be attached at the knees. In this way our legs are protected not just from weapons, but also from thorns, scathecraw, and jagged volcanic rocks.
(A Dark Elf Children's Rhyme)\n\nRemember when the Ruddy Man is about\nYou cannot scream and you cannot shout\nYou cannot run, you cannot hide,\nHe's already killed everyone who tried!\n\nWhat does the Ruddy Man like to eat?\nDark Elf eyes and Dark Elf feet!\nDark Elf tongues and Dark Elf toes!\nHide all you want, the Ruddy Man knows!\n\nWhen is the Ruddy Man out to play?\nWhenever the sky turns dark and gray!\nHe's in that mine, no, he's in that cave,\nHe wants to send you to your grave!\n\nWho can defeat the great Ruddy Man?\nOur Lord Vivec, that's who can!\nHe'll slash and strike the Ruddy Man through\nAnd then he'll make some Ruddy Man stew!
High Ordinator,\n\nWho can say what drives some of our blessed people to abandon their faith and take up with heretical gods? Greed, I suppose, is a motivating factor, as well as anger, jealousy, and the search for something better. A few, I can accept, are true believers, misguided though they might be. Most, I suspect, are duped fools chasing after whatever promises are laid before them. Take, for example, the Nycotic cult that has recently become active around Balmora. These are supreme fools indeed!\n\nIt's obvious that no one in their hierarchy can actually read or understand the Daedric alphabet. Instead, one of their founding members discovered an ancient scroll or forbidden text and bastardized a Daedric word into the Tamrielic tongue. How else can you explain them taking Daedric letters that mean nothing of the sort and deciding that the Prince they have pledged themselves to is someone called "Nycot." Yes, the first five letters of Clavicus Vile's name in Daedric bares a passing resemblance to the letters n, y, c, o, and t in the Tamrielic script, but that's not how it should be rendered or pronounced—the imbeciles!\n\nFurther, I don't even think they know that they're worshiping the Prince of Trickery and Bargains. I'm not sure who they think they've pledged themselves to, but that hasn't stopped them from causing problems from Balmora to the Bitter Coast. Some of the cult's leaders have demonstrated real talent in the arcane arts. Who knows? Perhaps Vile has actually heard their foolish prayers and decided to answer them! Regardless, we need to rouse the Order of War and march upon the caves and fissures where they hide and wipe them out—every last one of them!\n\nIn Vivec's name, you have my recommendation.\n\nOrdinator Alurua of the Order of Doctrine and Ordination
"Magus commands you."\n\nSuch a simple phrase, yet so full of power! I finally acquired the pass phrase to unlock the secrets of the obsolete analysis factotums. The sacred text of Sotha Sil's honored assistant was instrumental in my discovery.\n\nI wonder what the mechanical creature will tell me when I finally locate it and speak the phrase. My hope is that it will provide me with the means to finally make a better life for me and my son.
May this message reach you before the arms of our enemy. Falkreath is falling. Our stores are empty, our walls are crumbling, and the walking wounded are all that stands between the hordes of the Reach and our kin. \n\nI hold no illusions that this message will bring us salvation, but I hope it will bring retribution. It is with bent knee that I ask you to send your honored warriors to our hold to drive the Reachmen and their minotaur allies from our lands. Avenge us and rebuild. Don't let the ruin of stone stand as our only memorial.\n\n—Eerika Skjoralmor, Thane of Falkreath
By Vindamea Redoran, House Procurement Sister, Vivec City\n\nShould any non-Redoran ask you why our arms and armor are inspired by the claws and chitin of gigantic arthropods, just ask them if they've seen any Emperor Crabs lately—you know, those cathedral-sized crustaceans that once roamed the ashlands of Vvardenfell. Where did those go? \n\nWe killed them. We, the warriors of House Redoran. \n\nDuty, gravity, and piety: these are our watchwords. We are the wartime defenders of the House Dunmer of Morrowind. Follow the guidelines graven below for crafting in the Redoran style, and do not cut corners, for that would be unworthy of our House. \n\nAXES\n\nThe double-edged blades of our Redoran axes evoke the claws and mandibles of the mammoth Morrowind insects whose fierceness we embody. Though accented with bronze, the blades themselves should be of the most durable metal available, ideally carbon steel.  \n\nBELTS\n\nOur belts are strong but simple and relatively unadorned, though the buckles may be of ornamental chitin. If available, the leather should be tanned kagouti hide, though premium guar leather may be substituted at a pinch. \n\nBOOTS\n\nHouse Redoran boots are made of the toughest available leather, with thick soles for protection against our land's rugged terrain. Each instep is protected by two overlapping plates of rigid, pointed chitin.  \n\nBOWS\n\nThe classic Redoran bow is a composite of native funguswood and springy leg-chitin, faced with chitin plates on the limbs as they radiate from the grip. The quiver is of light chitin plates accented with bronze; arrows have broad, barbed heads. \n\nCHESTS\n\nOur House Redoran cuirasses are of flexible leather covered in layers of medium-sized overlapping chitin (or chitin-looking) plates, embossed and filigreed with ornamentation that may include our sacred scarab symbol. \n\nDAGGERS\n\nThe Redoran dagger has a broad and relatively short blade that ends in two diverging prongs that can inflict savage wounds on an unarmored opponent. Our House blade-fighting style emphasizes cutting over thrusting, so the twin prongs are no liability against armor. \n\nGLOVES\n\nTo facilitate grasping and grappling, even in the heaviest armor sets House Redoran gauntlets eschew rigid components over the hands and fingers, mounting overlapping chitin plates only on the forearms. These gauntlet-plates are typically pointed as an enhanced danger to enemies who get too close. \n\nHELMETS\n\nInasmuch as Redoran warriors are encouraged to get close and personal with their enemies, our helmets are designed to provide maximum protection for the head, with thick cranial domes and full face visors. The helmet's crown is ornamented with tall horns that resemble the mandibles of shalk. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nRedoran greaves are of heavy but flexible leather, with overlapping chitin (or chitin-appearing) plates fastened in front to protect the wearer's shins. These plates should match those mounted on the insteps of the outfit's boots. \n\nMACES\n\nThe Redoran mace has a heavy head that sprouts sharply edged flanges on all sides, curved like insect claws. Though accented with bronze, the mace head should be of heavy iron or steel—or even Dwarven metal, if available.   \n\nSHIELDS\n\nThe large, kite-shaped Redoran shield appears to be fashioned from the overlapping chitin plates of a gigantic scarab, and indeed our House scarab symbol often adorns the shield's central boss. The shield-face is topped with an open network of spiked bug-limbs that provide protection without blocking the wielder's vision.  \n\nSHOULDERS\n\nA Redoran pauldron is usually a single curved, flaring chitin (or chitin-looking) plate embossed with ornamental filigree, the whole mounted on the shoulder in such a way as to enable full, free movement of the shoulder and arm joints. \n\nSTAVES\n\nThe finial of a Redoran mage's spell staff echoes the shalk-mandible horns of our helmets. To keep these twin prongs from getting entangled with enemy armor in close combat, they are designed to easily break away without damage, and fit back onto the staff's shaft when the battle is over.  \n\nSWORDS\n\nThe sword of a warrior of House Redoran is broad, straight, and double-edged, with a murderous flaring double prong at the tip. Crossguards are narrow, as the Redoran swordfighter is trained to parry with the blade's forte, a hand's-width above the grip.
By Stoneheart the Heartstone\n\nClanfellows, in the name of the Hunt-Father, whom I invoke in his aspect as Alrabeg the Hunter, take now to heart these sacred schema that define the trappings of we who work the Bloodroot Forge. For it is as Bloodforge Smiths that we shall hammer the Nords upon the anvil of our rage and hatred, until all bend the knee before the Hunters of Hircine. Fellihboh! \n\nBOOTS\n\nLeather and stud, foot defense, kick and stomp, on offense, chase the prey, forward hence.
By Gherig Bullblood of the Dreadhorn Clan [Notes by Rena Hammerhands]\n\nWayward sons and daughters, set aside your old ways and embrace the Hunt-Father's terrible champion Domihaus! Henceforth, his ways shall be our ways! Listen to these, the new precepts for crafting our arms and armor, and set to work to outfit our reborn clan—as the Dreadhorn! \n\n[Found this in the Forge, instructions for scum on how to make scum-work. Who knew those barbarians could read, let alone write?]\n\nSTAVES\n\nDomihaus speaks for this land. Brandish an effigy of the Bloody-Horned and it will have no choice but to obey. Take the branches of our plundered home. Nail to it the face of the Hunt-Father's chosen rendered in steel and this icon will command the elements as he does.\n\n[I don't know what Daedra-bothering creature he's yammering about, but I'd like to put its head on the end of a stick myself.]
By Romien Garvette of the Whispering Shadows\n\nYou want to be beautiful. Beautiful, and whispering. Whispering, and dark. Dark, and beautiful, and whispering—with claws, such claws. You shall be cold, and sharp, and dark. You will be Ebonshadow.  \n\nYou cannot rest, you can never rest, so you might as well craft. Craft arms for Her will; craft armor for Her machinations. You are filled with dark nothingness, filled until you spill it into that which you shall make. And for that time of making, though you do it alone, that time alone will have Meaning. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nYou're broken, aren't you? Pieces missing, something missing. This! Yes! This will make you complete. Whole. This will bind you together. The shadows bind us together. Create this and be one. Forge this and be one. Finally, be one with Her shadows. You are not broken. You are complete. I am complete.
Date: (Month and day unknown) 1E 2712 (?)\n\nI write this with an unsteady hand. The factotums tell me that I'll regain full control of my new fingers soon enough. I have my doubts.\n\nI've never kept a journal. It always seemed like an act of vanity—putting all your life's pursuits to paper. As if anyone would want to read them. But given the circumstances, I think it's worth the effort. I find myself in a very strange place—the Clockwork City.\n\nIt was not an easy trip. I don't remember much. There were trees. Valenwood, I think. I remember striking something with a summoned blade, then a flash of light. The rest? Nothing but whispers and pain.\n\nWhen I came to, I found myself suspended in a glass sphere—submerged in some kind of viscous fluid. Polished metal clamps kept my shattered limbs in place, while tiny mechanical creatures stitched the flesh to new brass appendages. To my great surprise, I felt no need to breathe—just a deep thirst, and a dreamy state of mind. I saw a tall Elf gazing at me from the other side of the glass, his face warped by the curve of the sphere. He identified himself as Sotha Sil, and told me that I would live. He also told me that I had a son.\n\nThis came a surprise. I had no idea I was even pregnant. Apparently, the factotums discovered the tiny, barely viable child while they rushed to stabilize my ruined body. In Tamriel his severe prematurity would have been a death sentence, but here the impossible seems effortless.\n\nI never had any intention of having a baby. Toting a child around while making war on the Akaviri hardly seemed practical. But time and circumstance make fools of us all.\n\nI named him Marius—after my paternal grandfather. I hope this journal will serve him well if I succumb to these injuries. He should know something of his heritage at the very least.\n\nDate: 15 Sun's Dusk, 1E 2712 (?)\n\nThe more I learn about the Clockwork City, the more it appeals to me. The Brass Fortress provides few comforts. It's a dry and hard place—full of strange machines and stranger people. Dark Elves mostly. I've met Dunmer before, of course, but these Clockwork Apostles seem like a breed apart. They revere logic and innovation above almost anything else. Can you imagine? My fellow battlemages always mocked me for my dedication to cold reason. "Where's your fire, Luciana?" As if there's no fire in rigorous thought.\n\nSotha Sil still checks in on me from time to time. I've never met another person like him. The apostles worship him as a god, but I get the sense that it makes him uncomfortable. He only occasionally makes eye contact—not out of timidity, though. He's just always focused on something else. A device, or a book, or some other clockwork oddity. I ask him questions whenever the opportunity presents itself—questions about the nature of this place, his motives, his history. I never get straight answers. Nonetheless, he seems to enjoy the back and forth. I get the sense that even here, surrounded by worshipers and loyal machines, he remains profoundly alone.\n\nThe apostles keep telling me that blasphemy is acceptable here—even encouraged. But it seems like a belief without a backbone. My caretaker, Lector Marilia, was aghast when I told her about my conversations with the "Clockwork God." For example, I asked Sotha Sil about those persistent rumors—the ones about how he and the other Tribunes murdered Indoril Nerevar, the Dark Elf king. According to Marilia, the topic is strictly taboo. Even so, Sotha Sil answered my questions with a quiet grace that surprised even me.\n\n"Why do you think things happen?" he asked. I told him I didn't understand the question.\n\n"Why are we sitting here talking? Why does young Marius exist? Why do I reign over this place, while you convalesce within it?"\n\nI sat quiet for a moment, then replied: "Because that's just the way it is."\n\nHis cold face melted into one of his solemn half-smiles. "Exactly."\n\nI can't be sure, but it seemed like relief in his voice. His shoulders relaxed, his tone shifted—he had the look of a man at peace with his sins. Soon afterward, he thanked me for the conversation and left the room in silence.\n\nI looked down at Marius, sleeping soundly in his brass crib. In that moment, things seemed to make sense. The Clockwork City finally started to feel like home.

Scene 6. The High Seas. The deck of the dreaded Ash Viper. The terrifying vessel sinks slowly beneath the players' feet.\n\nEnter King Orgnum and the mysterious gold-masked Captain Castatil\n\nKing Orgnum:\nCastatil! My old nemesis! How dare you sully the deck of my most majestic vessel with your thin-heeled, High Elf boots!\n\n[Orgnum steps forward menacingly, drawing his poisoned blade with a sneer.]\n\nCaptain Castatil:\nHa! Brave words from the king of fishes. Look about you, Sea Elf! Your fleet sinks beneath the waves, and your sailors choke on foam and brine! Prepare to join them, you perfidious picaroon!\n\nKing Orgnum:\nIt is you who will do the dying, gold-skin! But before I run you through, throw down your mask. I wish to see the look of agony on your face when I skewer you upon my venomous blade!\n\nCaptain Castatil:\nVery well. In truth, I have waited years for this moment!\n\n[Castatil removes his mask to reveal his true identity: Marcivel, the aggrieved son of Eroldalin. King Orgnum gasps.]\n\nKing Orgnum:\nZounds! Marcivel? The wiry son of my old foe, Eroldalin?\n\nMarcivel:\nThe same! When you slew my father all those long years ago, I swore an oath to cast your ruin into the deep! Now, at last, I slake my thirst for revenge!\n\n[Marcivel draws his bright blade and makes ready to fight.]\n\nKing Orgnum:\nCome then, son of Eroldalin! Face the serpent's bite!\n\n[The two adversaries thrust, parry, and slash their way across the stage. Marcivel briefly gains the upper hand.]\n\nMarcivel:\nYou fight like a fishmonger's wife, Orgnum! Would you rob me of a true challenge? My bloody satisfaction is too quickly won!\n\nKing Orgnum:\nHar! The folly of youth! Your overconfidence shall be your downfall!\n\n[Orgnum slams his boot down upon a loose deck-board, knocking Marcivel off his feet. Orgnum pounces as the prone Marcivel dodges and parries.]\n\nKing Orgnum:\nLook how he wriggles upon the hook! Our duel reaches its savage climax!\n\nMarcivel:\nYou think you've bested me? Don't you know that you cannot skewer what you cannot see?\n\n[Marcivel takes a nearby bucket in his hands and splashes its contents upon Orgnum's face. The water washes away a thick coat of blue make-up, revealing the golden face of Marcivel's father, Eroldalin. Marcivel gasps.]\n\nMarcivel:\nFather? I … I don't understand!\n\nEroldalin:\nYou see the truth of it, at last. Yes, Marcivel, It is I, Eroldalin! Your father! Once-admiral of the Starborne Armada! \n\nMarcivel:\nI thought you dead! Killed at King Orgnum's hands!\n\nEroldalin:\nDead? Har! All that Maormer killed was an old fool's faith in Auri-El! Faith in the falsehood and pretense that shackles the Mer of Summerset!  Can you not see? The serpent's truth reigns supreme! All the Mer of Summerset shall learn! All shall pay homage to the great Snake-Wizard!\n\n[Marcivel springs to his feet, deftly parrying Eroldalin's final slash. With one last thrust, he pierces his father's heart.]\n\nEroldalin:\nCurses! I am killed!\n\n[Eroldalin dies.]\n\nMarcivel:\nQuiet now, father. Mine is the heart that is truly pierced! Woe! Misery! He who sought to kill his father's murderer has become his father's murderer! What now will I do?\n\n[Marcivel stands silent for a long moment, then takes up his discarded mask and dons it solemnly, thus becoming Captain Castatil once more.]\n\nCaptain Castatil:\nNay! I will not fall victim to self-pity! Marcivel is dead. Let his memory, and that of his father, sink with his shattered hulk. Here I swear upon the churning waters, there is but one Mer that wears this mask: Captain Castatil! Hero of Alinor! The Shield of Shimmerene! Summerset's valiant swashbuckler! And the ever-vigilant foe of the vile King Orgnum!\n\nMark me, Serpent-king! Soon you shall suffer Eroldalin's bloody fate! Skewered upon the shining blade of Captain Castatil!\n\n[End scene]
By Divayth Fyr\n\nAfter a recent discussion with a self-proclaimed "priest and scholar" of the Tribunal Temple, I find myself shamed (as I often am), but not surprised (as I never am) by the gross misunderstandings of the nature of the Daedra that "adopted" our ancestors. It seems that our priests these days are trained in little more than bland recitations and methods for parting pilgrims from their gold, a significant and disappointing departure from their traditional functions. Some may consider this blasphemy. I invite them to challenge me to debate—or magical contest, if they prefer. Though I do not often concern myself with society, someone must battle the tide of ignorance.\n\nI do not expect every Dunmer to attain understanding comparable to my own. Indeed, the common Elf has his place minding the mundane details of our race's day-to-day survival. Even so, laziness in any respect is abhorrent, and intellectual complacency cannot be permitted even among the lower echelons. Allow me to provide an accessible examination of the Good Daedra, beginning with the most easily misunderstood: Mephala.\n\n"Good" is an ill-suited descriptor for any Daedric being, and it is unfortunate it has come into casual use. As absolute expressions of their respective spheres, the Daedric Princes do not share our moral categorizations for behavior. The Daedra simply are. Mephala, Boethiah, and Azura have done much for the interests of the Dunmer, and in that sense they may appear to be good, but their motivations and goals (and the consequences of achieving them) are not known to us.\n\nThere's a reason Mephala is referred to as the "Webspinner," though modern Dunmer seem to ignore this appellation and instead project the sympathetic qualities they associate with Vivec—art in violence, cunning, enlightened poetry—back onto the Daedric being that "anticipated" him. This tendency serves to conceal much of Mephala's nature, which is exactly what the Prince would desire.\n\nMephala taught our ancestors the ways of secret murder, to be used against our enemies and even against our own in the place of all-out war, certainly "good" for our predecessors as they migrated across Tamriel and came into often-fractious contact with the Nords and Dwemer. We learned meticulous plotting and how to lie, ways to lure and trap our foes, how to manage complexity and predict outcomes. But few ask why this Daedric Prince would champion our people. The gullible fancy us chosen for our superior qualities and the cynical believe us a mere amusement for the Daedra, but these are both woefully simple-minded theories.\n\nWe must keep in mind that the Daedra are incapable of creation. They can only imitate, manipulate, and exaggerate. Some of them do perceive mortals as mere playthings, but I do not suspect this of Mephala. She does nothing without purpose, perceives all of Aurbis as an interconnected system of action and consequence, and employs herself in spinning new threads to influence outcomes.\n\nTo what end? That you must work out for yourself (as I have). Do you think me fool enough to reveal the secrets of the Prince of Secrets?
BEWARE! Beyond these gates, your safety cannot be guaranteed.\n\nInterference with factotum duties will be met with lethal force.
Quoril,\n\nYour burdensome assistant keeper has repeatedly hounded my rangers for opportunities to assist with their duties and applied for yet another transfer to ranger detail. I suggest you keep Elise too busy with her current duties to find opportunities to pester her betters. How you handle your staff is your own affair, but when it begins to affect our work, I take issue. And kindly inform Elise that rangers excel at silence, so she can begin her training there.\n\nConservator Vinelore
By Syrabane's ring, what have I done?\n\nMy dearest sister—the little sprite with pigtails who chased me through the flower gardens on Sundas afternoons. The soft-hearted girl with the singing voice of a meadow lark—fallen to a necromancer's charms. I can scarcely believe it. What did we do to earn this? What spirits did we offend? If only I'd been here. If only I'd stayed. This is all my fault.\n\nSomething had to be done. Practicing necromancy is an unforgivable sin. I pleaded with her to repent, or beg for the Direnni Clan's mercy. But she persisted. She looked into my eyes with a dull, flat-eyed stare and said, "They cannot kill me, sister. I cannot be killed. I will rise again, and again, and again, for all eternity." All the kindness and gentle innocence was gone. In that moment, I barely recognized her.\n\nSo I performed the ritual. I bound her to the sarcophagus. I shouted the words of binding, and kindled the sacred flames. Then I wept beside the tomb, listening to her froth and wail until she finally fell silent.\n\nI only hope that Lauriel's spirit can find peace here in the acropolis, because she cannot leave. She can never leave. Auri-El forgive me, for I will never forgive myself. Never.
Regrettably, my attempts at the preservation of creatures of the Daedric host appear to be a dead end. The pull of Oblivion always wins in the end. Much like sculptures in ice, my works in this medium are a fleeting beauty.  \n~~ \nThere it is, like an estranged partner hovering over the remains of a recent split, familiar boredom comes calling. I envy the long dormancy of draugr at times like this. \n~~ \nSensing my malaise, one of my ambitious attendants took it upon herself to seek a distraction for her master. She brought me a dry volume of Dwemer history to while away my time. I briefly considered watching her corpse dry into a leathery husk as a more thrilling alternative, but there was a confident smirk in her expression that convinced me to indulge her. \n~~ \nLizabet has served me well. The book she brought me provides a kernel of truth to a fanciful legend. The author claims to have paid a recent visit to the long lost ruin known as Fang Lair. I believe I'd like to see this necropolis. \n~~ \nThe bulk of my followers now scour the Dragon's Teeth Mountains for Fang Lair. Even with clues provided by the historian, it will be quite an undertaking. Even so, this renewed purpose has bolstered my patience. \n~~ \nDuring these months of search, I've collected many records on Dwemer and Dragons. Their ambitions were not dissimilar. Mastery over existence! I'm not so different, though we've all chosen different avenues to explore. Considering their fates, I have no desire to follow in their footsteps. \n~~ \nFinally, Fang Lair is in my grasp. The price paid was quite light. The lives of a few dozen of my followers were claimed by these treacherous mountains, but they are settling into their new roles as well as can be expected. \n~~ \nThis place is beautifully desolate. The bones of thousands are strewn throughout the crumbling halls. Some shattered, some blackened, and some fossilized in the stone itself. A record of extinction and terror, but is the centerpiece to this exhibit to be found here among them? \n~~ \nNow here's an unexpected turn. Fang Lair was not entirely uninhabited. We had a very special squatter in our midst: an ancient Lich from a time when the Dragon still lived and breathed, and one of the group responsible for ensuring it ceased to do so. He has so much to tell me, once I've made him more compliant.\n~~\nThe Lich conducted obsessive studies of the Dragon's remains during his stay here, so very kind of him to share. Adapting them to my methods will not be difficult. I'm already envisioning a wondrous display, though my conversation with the Lich and his companions has revealed a missing element. This Dragon possessed a priesthood during its lifetime and the High Priestess is nowhere to be found. I must have her.
By Orryn the Black\n\nFor too long the magical discipline of Necromancy has been disregarded as a mere subset of Conjuration, or worse, dismissed outright because it is "evil." But our efforts in Fang Lair will impress all Tamriel with the importance of Necromancy! As such, it is critical that you lesser members of the Blackmarrow make an impressive showing; therefore, when crafting your arms and armor, you will follow these instructions to the letter. Unless you'd prefer, of course, to serve as a subject of experimentation. Hmm?\n\nSWORDS\n\nOur swords fundamentally hearken back to Redguard roots, though the austere descendants of the Ansei would shy away from the baroque and spiky improvements we've made to their overly simple designs. The fools! Soon, they, too, will acknowledge our greatness and kneel before us.
By Joseryne Madier\n\nIn boots dyed black by dead man's soil,\nI stood upon fear's wheezing threshold\nHidden there, beyond brambles dried\nThe wolf-throats howled and dark boughs sighed\n\nOnly once did I stray within\nA fiery youth with a Midyear heart\nAnd hair not yet tussled by death's boney hand\nSoul not yet seared by dread's hot brand\n\nOn moss-covered bones and stinkhorn stalks,\nMy feet found frightful, oily purchase\nAnd through the trees swirled fetid murk,\nWhere growling, blood-starved creatures lurked\n\nAll around, I heard their breath,\nLike a bow-saw drawn through rain-soaked wood,\nAnd then the howling! That mournful hymn,\nTo the hunt-king Hircine and his murderous whims\n\nI turned and ran through raking thorns,\nA coursed hare's panic upon my eyes\nWith each clumsy stride, the snarling grew\nYellowed fangs set upon flesh to hew.\n\nI burst through the tree line, a ragged thing,\nWith linens tattered and skin flayed deep\nBut the black wolves relented, behind the briars,\nTheir coal-eyes fixed, alight with white fire\n\n"Flee from here," they seemed to say\n"Back to your hearth and your hollow joys,\n"But know that we wolves linger still\n"Return for your last blood-soaked thrill!"
By Loremaster Celarus\n\nThe Psijic Order eschews combat, regarding all violence as a failure of negotiation and diplomacy, which are the highest of the non-magical arts. Our garb, therefore, lacks the martial look and feel of most "armor"—but that doesn't mean it's any less protective than clanking suits of metal, for powerful protective runes are woven into the very substance of our robes. \n\nBOWS\n\nJust above and below the handgrip, Psijic bows are adorned with Mundial Globes that represent our order's equal commitment to the defense of all mortals that walk the surface of Nirn.

By Wailimo the Mystic\n\nI knew this was going to happen. Why the Welkynars ever thought to bring that Sea Sload to our city, I'll never know. And now Cloudrest is in ruins and I'm lucky to be alive.\n\nIt all started with a dark mist pouring down from the Aerie, like a cauldron bubbling over. A hush fell over the marketplace. We weren't sure what was going on, truth be told. But we all knew it wasn't good.\n\nThat's when we started to hear the screaming from within the mist. Everyone started to rush out of the city's gates, fast as they could. I've never seen a more panicked crowd in my life. Everyone screaming, running, trying to escape.\n\nBut the mist was faster than our steps, and soon we were enveloped by it. It felt like a cold fog against my skin. Suddenly, my knees buckled. All my strength left me at once. I could feel my heartbeats beginning to slow. My whole being felt heavy. Never before had I felt such extreme exhaustion.\n\nI knew I was going to die. Soon, my heartbeat would entirely stop. As I laid there, all I could think was … how many will die with me?\n\nIt was then that I was grasped within two mighty talons. Welkynar Olorime had come to save me, quickly placing me in the upper reaches of the city. I barely remember my rescue, albeit the feeling of my torso being tightly squeezed, the wind against my skin.\n\nI don't know what manner of power that Sea Sload has, nor do I want to. But it nearly took my life. Just as it has already taken the lives of so many others.
By Artuudawen Thousand-Shoes, Sapiarch of Apparel Analysis\n\nThe distinctive style of the robes of the Sapiarchs has not been designed so much as it's been refined, the style distilling the clothing choices of a hundred generations of the Wise. Every detail has its own deep history, all memorialized, of course, in the Apparel Archives of the Crystal Tower. The lighter styles of robes are for research in controlled environments, while the heavier, armored robes provide protection when a Sapiarch must do research in the field.  \n\nAXES\n\nThough the bearing of weapons is usually delegated to research assistants, and their main function is as symbolic representations of authority, our arms are also supremely practical as weapons. Take, for example, our majestic eagle-claw axe, with its razor-sharp three-pointed blade. Most effective.

By Telenger the Artificer\n\nSome of my peers dismiss our nautical neighbors the Maormer as mere Elven pirates, seafaring bandits with no more sophistication than Gold Coast highway robbers, but this is a mistake: though over time some breakaway clans have descended into near-barbarism, the core clans loyal to King Orgnum are organized and well-disciplined martial forces it would be a mistake to underestimate. I will try below to describe their typical arms and armor turnout. \n\nSHOULDERS\n\nThe shell-shaped Pyandonean pauldrons are constructed of stiffened porpoise-leather often capped by a covering of orgnium, the mysterious light metal the Sea Elves use for their heavier arms and armor. Symbols of rank are typically affixed to shoulder armor for the easy identification of officers.
By Lyranth the Foolkiller\n\nWhen possible variations in physical appearance are unlimited, it is an act of supreme will and discipline to confine oneself to a uniform semblance. For we proud Dremora, who regard all other Daedra with well-earned disdain, self-expression is nothing but vulgar self-indulgence. Heed these regulations, kynfolk, and don't disgrace your clan mates with unauthorized variations—or it's the scathe-rings for you, and don't think otherwise. \n\nBOOTS\n\nDremora sabatons are tough and soled with thick treads, for we stride the surfaces of worlds uncounted, regardless of the ruggedness of their terrain. Our toes and arches are protected by shields of filigreed dark-metal, but our boots' insteps and uppers are of finest Argonian hide—a lesson learned on Nirn, for not all mortal ideas should be disdained.
By Uraccanach the Witchman (as transcribed by Juno Procillus, Academy of Chorrol)\n\nFor those who would honor Hircine the Hunter, it is right and proper to adopt the apparel and arms of his Huntsmen, those spear-shakers, fewterers, and whippers-in of the Lord of the Hunting Grounds. Just as his Huntsmen evoke Hircine's Aspects by their appearance, we honor him by emulating our prince's Huntsmen. All hail the Great Hunter! Even his curses are blessings! It is so, for I have said it. \n\nDAGGERS\n\nThe large hunting knives of Hircine's Hounds serve many purposes, of which "weapon" is only one: skinning knife, pointer-of-stakes, and trimmer of net cords are among the others. The blade has but a single edge, but it's forged of heavy steel and balanced for both chopping and thrusting. It's a clever tool, and thus dedicated to Gulibeg the Quick Fox.

When you return home after a long and grueling journey, you want a nice warm bed and a hot meal. The same is true of your vine-tongue! Well, except for the hot meal. They prefer their food raw and somewhat wiggly. Your vine-tongue deserves the best, and it's your job to provide it for them.\n\nFor maximum comfort, your vine-tongue prefers a humid climate on a patch of soil surrounded by standing water. In addition, the area you designate as your vine-tongue's lair needs to appeal to wandering creatures. Once your beloved plant gets big enough, it will want to supplement the delicious diet you provide with prey that it catches on its own. Not only does this give your plant a sense of accomplishment, it helps keep your home free of vermin.\n\nDid you realize that vine-tongues make excellent sentries? Put them up high where they can observe their surroundings and admire the sights. If anyone tries to come near your property, your new friend will greet them appropriately. Just be sure to restrain your vine-tongue before friends and family come to visit in order to avoid any unfortunate misunderstandings.

[Note: Collected by researcher Solis Aduro from an oral tradition of the Adzi-Kostleel tribe and not otherwise attested.]\n\nThere was first only Atak, the Great Root. It knew of nothing but itself, so it decided to be everything. It grew and grew, trying to fill the nothing with itself. As it grew it formed new roots, and those roots took names, and they wanted space of their own to grow. \n\nThen Atak learned that there were things other than itself.  They were just like Atak, but went a different way from it. They saw and made strange new things that did not last except in how it changed them.\n\nAtak continued to grow until something came back from the nothing. It was like a root but had scales and eyes and a mouth. It told Atak that it was called Kota, and it had been growing, too. Now that it had a mouth, it was hungry.\n\nAtak named Kota for what it was: serpent! It put roots through the serpent's eyes. But Kota was old and strong like the root, and had grown fangs while it was away. It bit Atak. They coiled around each other. From their struggle, new things came to be. Atak learned things Kota had learned, including hunger, and so it bit Kota back. They ate and roiled for so long they became one and forgot their conflict. \n\nThey shed their skin and severed their roots and called themselves Atakota, who said "Maybe." \n\nWhen Atakota said this, the skin it had shed knew itself. It ate the severed roots and even though it was dead, it followed Atakota like a shadow. \n\nAtakota continued to roil, and each of its scales was a world that it devoured. But now Atakota was not in conflict, and things had time to begin and end. The shadow wished it could eat these things, but its belly was full of roots that were growing.\n\nWhen the shadow could bear it no longer, it swam closer to Atakota and spat out the roots. Now that its belly was empty, the shadow almost ate them again and everything else it saw. But it had come to see the roots as its own after carrying them, so instead it told them secrets and went to sleep.\n\nThe roots found others and told them how they had survived in the belly of the shadow and how they were still able to grow there. When they shared this knowledge with the others it changed them, and they took on new forms with new names. \n\nSome of these spirits wanted to keep the names and forms they had chosen, but they had learned them through the shadow, and it was now in all of them, making them temporary. They learned of hunger and conflict, and they learned to fear change and called it Death.\n\nThese spirits were angry and afraid, but the roots showed the spirits ways between places from when Atak had made paths out of nothing. They could use these riverways to hide from Death.\n\nThe spirits were content and set about to make things that looked like them and shared in their aspects and loved them. They kept growing until they were as big as Atakota, and they forgot it came before them, and that it had a shadow that was sleeping.\n\nIn time, the worlds were too big and there was no more room. Again the spirits went to the roots to ask for more. But the roots had gone to sleep content with what they had made, because it changed so often that it did not need to grow. \n\nThe spirits grew so desperate and hungry that they tore at Atakota's skin and drank of its blood. They ate until they broke Atakota, so that Atak remembered growing, and Kota remembered being nothing. There was conflict again, and from the spirits Atak and Kota learned about Death, so there was violence, blood, and sap.\n\nIn the chaos the spirits were lost and afraid, so they ate others and themselves. They drank of blood and sap, and they grew scales and fangs and wings. And these spirits forgot why they had made anything other than to eat it.\n\nThere were other spirits that still clung to what they were and what they had made. A forest spirit came and saw that the roots loved their children like she loved hers, so she taught them to walk and talk. They told her secrets with new words, and she sang the song back to them. The roots woke up when they heard this, and joined with the forest. \n\nThe roots saw that Kota's blood had made oceans, and Atak's sap had made stones, and each of these spirits had never known the shadow. The roots knew what this would mean, and asked the shadow to protect its children.\n\nThe shadow woke. It looked upon Kota and Atak and saw how different the nothing had become and how it was becoming the same as before. It remembered it was the skin of Atakota, and it was bigger than Kota or Atak alone, so it decided it would eat them both. \n\nAnd it did. The shadow ate the snake and the root, and the sap and stone, and the oceans of blood, and all of the spirits. It had eaten everything before it remembered the roots that were its children, so it looked unto itself to find them. When the shadow saw this, it remembered that it was a skin of something that came before, and it had eaten what came after, and this would be an end that always was.\n\nAnd so the shadow shed its skin, even though that was all it was, and it fell like a shroud over the roots, promising to keep them safe within its secrets.

A Moon-Singer Story of the Hero Khunzar-ri.\n\nIn the time before time, when the sixteen kingdoms were barely more than sixteen prides, the great hero Khunzar-ri met a demon on the border of Elsweyr.\n\nThe demon, whose name was Kaalgrontiid, proclaimed in a powerful voice, "My brothers and I shall take this land. Its treasures and even the moons above will be ours!"\n\n"I do not think so, foul demon," Khunzar-ri said. "Elsweyr and all it contains, even the moons above, are under my protection."\n\nThe demon laughed. "You cannot stop us, little cat-thing! You are nothing but soft flesh and fur, while we are scales and teeth and claws!"\n\nKhunzar-ri thought for a moment. "Perhaps you are right, oh massive demon. You are certainly too much for even my prodigious strength." Then he thought to himself, "That is why I shall gather a Kra'Jun, a company of heroes. Together, we will find a way to stop you, foul demon!"\n\nSo, while the demons ravaged Elsweyr and chased the moons through the sky, Khunzar-ri went on a quest to form his Kra'Jun. He gathered the greatest champions of the age and convinced them to do what they had never done before—work together. He called to his side the Altmer, Nurarion the Perfect, who wielded the Subtle Blade. He coerced Flinthild Demon-Hunter to leave her castle in the far north. He used sweet words and flattered Anequina Sharp-Tongue, queen and moon-priest of the Ne Quin-al pride, until she agreed to stand beside him. Finally, Khunzar-ri asked he who would become the Betrayer to lend him his sword, for there was no finer warrior in all the land.\n\nWith the Kra'Jun assembled, Khunzar-ri and his companions set forth to defeat Kaalgrontiid and his demon brothers. For forty-one days and forty-one nights, great and terrible battles raged across Elsweyr. The Kra'Jun won some of these battles and they lost some of these battles, but they could not find a way to kill or drive off the demons. It was he who would become the Betrayer who eventually made the suggestion. "The demons seek to consume the moons. Why not let them have them? Or, to be more precise, let them think we have surrendered and acquiesced to their plans."\n\n"A brilliant idea!" Khunzar-ri concurred. "But instead of consuming the moons, we let the moons steal the life from them!"\n\nAnequina the moon-priest nodded in understanding. "This one can do that. This one can talk to Jone and Jode and ask them to consume the demons."\n\nThen, Khunzar-ri used every bit of guile and charm he possessed to convince the demons that the Kra'Jun was now willing to help them. He told them where to meet, at a moon temple of renown, and waited while Anequina communed with the moons. "It is not in the nature of Jone and Jode to fully consume the demons," Anequina said, "but Jode will take enough of their life force to weaken them. That should allow us to contain them."\n\n"I know just the place," proclaimed Nurarion the Perfect. "An ancient place of power, forgotten and long abandoned. We can trap the demons there."\n\nKhunzar-ri was proud of the wisdom of his Kra'Jun, but he needed a way to lure the weakened demons into the trap. They had to enter the place of their own accord, for even weakened demons were too dangerous for the Kra'Jun to deal with. So Anequina and Flinthild put their heads together and devised a plan. They told Khunzar-ri, and he smiled and twitched his tail. "Fragrant!" he said.\n\nSo the demons arrived at the moon temple and Anequina, acting as moon-priest instead of queen, opened a connection between Nirn and Jode in the form of a shaft of moonlight. The demons, greedy and hungry for lunar power, eagerly stepped into the moonlight, but immediately realized they had been tricked. They roared in pain as a portion of their life force was drawn away by Jode. It took Kaalgrontiid every bit of his remaining strength, but he resisted and rallied his brothers. They broke free of the shaft of treacherous moonlight and fled into the wilderness.\n\nAnequina then deposited a sliver of the demon-infused moonlight in an urn and gave it to Flinthild. Flinthild and the Kra'Jun took the urn to the ancient place of power, while Khunzar-ri went to do what he did best: convince the demons to follow the lure and walk into the trap of their own free will. And that is what he did, before the Betrayer earned his name. As you shall hear.\n\nThese are the words, and the words are true.
I found a partial account of a long-range Ayleid raid upon Mzulft that mentioned the Wrathstone at least nine times. The conflict revolved around the artifact, which is odd since by the Dwemers' own account it was not within the city and the timing is all off. Why would the Ayleids attack the Dwemer while their empire was in the midst of a slave rebellion?\n\n* * *\nMzulft was plagued by conflict in the years surrounding that account. The city repelled attacks from the Nords, Ayleids, and even neighboring Dwemer clans. Were they all after the Wrathstone?\n\n* * *\nThe great Dwemer architect, Mhuvnak, disappeared from Mzulft around this time. The prevailing theory is that he was a casualty of war, but from what I've found, there's no reason to believe Mzulft suffered any significant losses before the Nords sacked it during the reign of High King Gellir.\n\n* * *\nI have it! Kagrenzel. Mhuvnak departed for Kagrenzel after the Ayleid raid. He'd have no reason to leave the safety of the city for a small holdout in the mountains unless there was something important there. Tomorrow I make for Eastmarch.\n\n* * *\nAnother setback. The pair of Nords I hired as an escort fell, quite literally, into a death trap almost immediately. This place reminds me more of Yokudan tombs than Dwemer remnants. It seems like its entire purpose is to kill those who would search it.\n\n* * *\nAfter a very cautious search of Kagrenzel, I'm confident that the Wrathstone is not here. My current theory is that Mhuvnak came here to retrieve it. For all its devious designs, this place is best suited for catching thieves, not rebuffing an army. Mhuvnak must not have trusted the defenses to protect the artifact from his rivals.\n\n* * *\nMhuvnak was the most brilliant architect of his time. I don't believe someone as meticulous as he was to just take the Wrathstone and run off without a plan. Mzulft may have more answers.\n\n* * *\nI decided to forgo an escort this time. I don't have much luck with them and I'll need to take my time searching Mzulft for answers. Unsurprisingly, animunculi still roam the halls continuing their duties in an unbroken circuit for all time. I hear things though, echoing from deep in the ruins. Muffled clatter and animal shrieks. Something is keeping the constructs occupied, and that's a benefit to me, for now.\n\n* * *\nI'm running out of paper to contain my notes on Mzulft thus far, and I've only scratched the surface of this city. Most scholars would be content to spend their lives unraveling the secrets of this place, but I have my sights set higher than most. No more distractions. Find what I can about Mhuvnak and where he may have escaped to.\n\n* * *\nThere is an observatory of sorts in Mzulft, dominated by a device that fills the room. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't think Dwemer were known for their appreciation of the world above them, let alone the sky.\n\n* * *\nThere are surviving writings here. Not from the time of Mhuvnak, but long after. The Dwemer reclaimed Mzulft from the Nords and were thriving before their ultimate disappearance. This device, the Oculory, could observe the world with frightening acuity, when it worked. The Dwemer were using it to locate the lost Vault of Mhuvnak, but the "Frostvault" is buried in a mountain of ice. I've found no record of an attempt to reclaim it for their kingdom.\n\n* * *\nIf I've interpreted things correctly, I believe I know where the Frostvault may be found; however, I'm running low on funds. Quintus's estate was more debt than assets and if I'm to see this through I can't afford to be wrong.\n\n* * *\nI'm on the right path, I'm sure of it. I found evidence of Dwemer construction in the mountains to the west. It looks like the ice has retreated in the ages between when my records were written and today. I'd love to see what else the melting glacier has revealed, but the resulting crevasse has become an attractive shelter for Goblins. After everything I've been through, I will not be stopped by a band of grubby rat-eaters. I'll take the gamble and put everything on this being the site of the Frostvault.

By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nFrom ancient times till the present, the Cult of Meridia, no matter how often suppressed, always rebounds and reappears. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, for a Daedric Prince, the Lady of Infinite Energies rarely requires genuinely terrible behavior from her worshipers, though she can be severe on those she considers enemies. Mortals who revere her often honor her by adopting an armor style inspired by that of the Aurorans, Meridia's Daedric warriors. This look is so consistent among her cultists in every place and time that one can legitimately say there is a "Meridian" style.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nThe daggers Meridian cultists use are especially valuable for catching the blades of their foes, tangling them temporarily and potentially even disarming them.
By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force\n\nThis one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor.\n\nBELTS\n\nAnequine belts, as it is with most Khajiiti fashion, are both stylish and practical. After all, it would not do for warriors in the midst of battle to have their leggings fall down. Sleek and sturdy, these leather belts have proven themselves against the stress of combat time and time again.
By Captain Nala-do, Northern Elsweyr Defense Force\n\nThis one is determined to record the traditional appearance of Anequine arms and armor despite the attempts of Euraxia the Usurper Queen to replace them with new, inferior designs. Our martial traditions in the North date back to the time of Darloc Brae, and though nowadays we no longer employ his savage methods, one must confess that the Golden Beast had a truly Khajiiti sense of style in arms and armor. \n\nBOWS\n\nThe Wood Elves claim their bows to be the finest in all of Tamriel. This one does not place much faith in such claims, given that she has held an Anequine bow. Like all fine Khajiiti weapons, the balance of this lacquered bow is impeccable. Each arrow flies straight and true, striking with more force than a Pahmar's paw.
By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval\n\nWhile it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. \n\nAXES\n\nUnlike the crude axes of northern barbarians, Pellitine cleavers combine style and martial efficacy, making each weapon a work of art. The sumptuous curve of the axe head, accented by sleek, fang-like prongs allow the attacker to both cleave and stab with every swing. \n\nBELTS\n\nIn Pellitine, fit is of paramount importance. Metal buckles can only approximate the wearer's girth, resulting in a slouching and unsightly waistline fit only for a city vagrant or a cane-farmer. Our braided leather belts guarantee a perfect cinch every time.\n\nBOOTS\n\nA Khajiit's graceful feet should never suffer the indignity of a close-toed boot. Without the freedom to flex and retract, our claws grow dull and useless. And dull-clawed Khajiit can hardly call themselves children of Alkosh! Alas, the boots' leather padding still covers the shapely calves and ankles, but complex lacing helps the leg retain a pleasing shape.\n\nBOWS\n\nSince time out of memory, man, mer, and beast have all suffered death and defeat at the point of Pellitine arrows. The Wood Elves fancy themselves Tamriel's greatest marksmen, but their wooden pauper-bows cannot match the range or precision of their Khajiiti counterparts. A flexible metal frame, senche-gut bow-strings, and peerless styling make the Pellitine bow the envy of archers everywhere.\n\nCHESTS\n\nTorval's damp climate and our distaste for restrictive clothing make metal armor very unpopular here in Southern Elsweyr. Leave heavy iron hauberks to the hoary Nords and flat-footed Bretons, yes? A Pellitine cuirass, by contrast, is typically made of durable boiled leather, shaped, stamped, and tailored to fit the wearer's torso like a glove.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nNo shape is more distinctive to the Khajiiti people than the curve. The rounded crescents of Jone and Jode and the natural flexure of our fangs and claws are both given voice in the Pellitine dagger. The whorled guard and roaring pommel likewise reflect the frightful mysteries of Khajiiti culture!\n\nGLOVES\n\nA Khajiiti glove must do two things well: protect the forearms, and leave the fingers bare. Pellitine gloves boast perfection on both counts. The stylish leather vambraces deflect all but the strongest blows. But more importantly, these gloves leave the claws completely unrestricted, allowing the wearer to slash and stab to their heart's content.\n\nHELMETS\n\nThere is no greater weapon on the battlefield than fear. When an enemy's eyes widen and their jaw falls slack with terror, the contest is already decided. To that end, Pellitine helmets all bear the terrifying aspect of a snarling cat-demon.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nAs Khibazi the Whirlwind once said, "All fights begin at the thighs." Tailored silken pants provide ample flexibility and protection at the knees, while molded leather greaves protect the upper-legs. Like all elements of the Pellitine panoply, these greaves feature ornate crescents and swirling contours that complement the wearer's inherent grace.\n\nMACES\n\nThe defining features of foreign maces are their simplicity and tremendous weight. No surprise, then, that Pellitine maces are both light and beautiful. Their lacquered wooden construction and hooked shape allow for swift and brutal strikes that put the crude, loping swings of barbarian maulers to shame.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nNorthern barbarians are often surprised by the comparative lightness of the Pellitine aegis. Rather than try to lift a heavy iron heater shield, Khajiiti warriors of Southern Elsweyr rely on hardened leather affixed to a sturdy bronze frame—an arrangement that provides maneuverability and protection in equal measure.\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nNothing enhances a warrior's imposing silhouette quite like a set of sturdy pauldrons. These protective shoulder-coverings feature subtle curves and sharpened leather prongs that are impossible to miss. \n\nSTAVES\n\nWhen it comes to martial refinement, the Pellitine staff is a weapon without peer. While the haft is almost always fashioned out of stout Tenmar oak, the headpiece is a bronzesmith's masterpiece. Fragile lotus blossoms and grand chandeliers rest atop the staff like a king's crown, making even the most boorish wielder look like royalty.\n\nSWORDS\n\nMuch like the Pellitine dagger, the swords of Southern Elsweyr evince the regal and deadly nature of the Khajiiti people. The grand, curved blade often features ornate, swirling designs that complement the guard's rounded contours. In skilled hands, this weapon can kill practically anything, from the clumsiest Goblin to the most fearsome dro-m'Athra.
By Cashia Khrasaat-Plume, Envoy of the Mane, Torval\n\nWhile it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light on our Southern Elsweyr military traditions. \n\nGLOVES\n\nA Khajiiti glove must do two things well: protect the forearms, and leave the fingers bare. Pellitine gloves boast perfection on both counts. The stylish leather vambraces deflect all but the strongest blows. But more importantly, these gloves leave the claws completely unrestricted, allowing the wearer to slash and stab to their heart's content.
By Azin-jo, Esteemed Bishop of Sunspire\n\nRejoice, children of Alkosh! After many lean years, the Dragon King of Cats has returned to guide us to glory. We Khajiit are magnificent, yes, with our glistening fangs and silky fur. But to truly honor Alkosh, we must adorn ourselves with a fitting panoply—armor and weapons that give voice to both Khajiit and Dragon! Therefore, the smith-adepts of Sunspire have created this collection of arms and armor. Each piece bears the First Cat's blessing.\n\nBELTS\n\nAny avowed Khajiit, from highest curate to lowliest novitiate, can tell you that prayer begins at the belly. We do not mutter our mantras to blessed Alkosh with our mouths alone. No! We summon them up from the stomach. No surprise then that we protect our stomachs with woven cloth and metals of the highest quality.
(A Mythic Hero's Song)\n\nWhen the sixteen kingdoms were only sixteen tribes,\nA hero ambled forth, all tall and tough and wise,\nHow sleek he is! How fragrant! A five-claw? No, a ten!\nHe wrestles giants just for fun and charges into senche's den!\n\nCHORUS\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it loud, sing it clear. Fighter, lover, poet, thief.\nHe's one Khajiit to cheer!\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it proud, sing it strong! Brave and sly, rarely shy.\nHe never steers you wrong!\n\nNo dungeon cage can hold him, no lock can bar his way,\nSome stories claim that he's a god, or so they say,\nHe dragged the light from Jone and Jode down to the growing fields,\nAnd now we have moon-sugar and all the good it yields.\n\nCHORUS\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it loud, sing it clear. Fighter, lover, poet, thief.\nHe's one Khajiit to cheer!\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it proud, sing it strong! Brave and sly, rarely shy.\nHe never steers you wrong!
By Magnius Calussa\n\nOur message spreads among the ranks and soon it shall spread to the people beyond. It is time we write down and teach the Words of the True Masters. The Gods that Fly Above Us. For I have listened and will share what I have heard. Their wisdom. Their commands.\n\nWhat follows is my understanding of the Words of Dragons and my interpretation of what those Words mean, imperfect though that interpretation may be.\n\n* * *\n"Dov nifaas wiixseroth."\nDragons fear not a trap of vines.\n\nBe aware of your strengths. Fall not for weaknesses that would trip lesser beings.\n\n* * *\n"Nihnzey miir wah viik."\nBetrayal is the path to defeat. \n\nBetrayal, literally, a poisoned brother, fractures alliances. It can be the beginning of the end.\n\n* * *\n"Nihnzey miir wah krongrah." \nBetrayal is the path to great victory. \n\nThe Masters are wise. Sometimes breaking an alliance is necessary to achieve victory. \n\n* * *\n"Rul jol, lok."\nWhen unsteady, rise. \n\nI first misunderstood this, for I thought that "lok" meant just "sky," and that we should look to the sky, but now I understand fully. It is not a command to look to the sky and seek help from above. It is a metaphor for flight. "Rise." Brace yourself and push yourself harder above the turbulent winds. Do not seek the safety of the ground. Rise and seek greater glory instead.\n\n* * *\n"Nunon mey bo strun voqostiid naal sov."\nOnly a fool flies in a storm and is surprised by the shock.\n\nBe aware of your circumstances. Do not be so blind to your surroundings or focused on your goals that you forget to see the obvious dangers around you. \n\n* * *\n"Dey on folook fey ko ven ahrk ron."\nImplausible spirits haunt a grove in the wind and rain.\n\nWhatever you think you see, look again. Look closer. Is there a more reasonable explanation? \n\nA note: The word "dey" seems to have a rather bawdy direct translation. At its core, it means "false," but has the connotation of "laughably false," laughing at those who make a claim. "On" is a little more slippery. I think it means something like "soul," but more empty. Something lifeless.\n\n* * *\n"Nid jiid, nid kun."\nNo moon, no moonlight. \n\nEnsure that your resources are secure. That you know where they come from and that you do not take them for granted. \n\n* * *\nThese are but a few of the pieces of wisdom that I have overheard in my time near the Masters. I feel I have a good grasp of their ancient language, but I must listen closely for the wisdom in the words. I will stay close, as I am able. I am not an important officer, but my duties allow me to listen. And I will report, that you may hear their wisdom, as well. I will share more when the time is right.
Marillan,\n\nI know you're nervous about leading the initiates tomorrow, but there's nothing to it. Just do your best to encourage them to honor those who came before and to be the best Dragonguard they can be.\n\nIf you did want to test their wits, however, I came up with a riddle for how to get across the chasm. You can even make it into a competition. Whoever solves it first can have the privilege of shining both our boots. After all, what's the point of moving up the ladder if we can't reap some benefits?\n\n"Take the dust of our fallen foe and offer it to the altar. As you walk the path of the Dragonguard, may your steps never falter."\n\nIlend Balbus
Tigerius Falco: "Shashara, your green eyes are so green … like green-colored gems!"\n\nShashara: "Sweet Tigerious, this one wishes we never have to part."\n\nTigerius Falco: "Your grace is a gift from the Divines, Shashara. I would do anything for you."\n\nShashara: "Except leave the Imperial army."\n\nTigerius Falco: [shifts nervously] "The army has been good to me. Took me in when I was an orphan on the streets of the Imperial City."
By Gwaerelos, Greenblessed Master of Arms, Elden Root\n\nThe Spinners will tell you that all the world is a tree. Evils burrow under the bark like weevils and drink the goodness out of life. The Green's warriors search the boughs, plucking vices from their hiding places and devouring them with relish. Transgression and consequence. Wickedness and payment in kind. We Stags exact that punishment. We claim that payment in blood. Z'en, god of toil and vengeance, demands nothing less.\n\nMACES\n\nThe head of a Stag mace closely resembles a flower preparing to bloom. But the petals are far from delicate. Heavy, spiked chitin wrapped around a prodigious iron weight make this the most brutal weapon south of the Strid River.
Yeah, so, this is my journal. I'm Yamighu of Peryite's Chosen. Hopefully this book doesn't become privy paper like my last journal did. I'll dust these pages with some itching powder just in case. I can stand the itch. Most others can't—especially in their tender regions.\n\nTraveling to find a new location for my group's worship of Peryite has been hard for an Orc like me. I gave up my home for Peryite, but that's a long story that requires more ungorth than Elsweyr has. Still looking for a new home. Heard about this place called Black Kiergo and decided I should visit one day. That day is now.\n\nBlack Kiergo is a vast, underground slum that stretches beneath the streets of Senchal. Supposedly, secrets paths lead into Black Kiergo, so I'll need to find one of these paths. In addition to the poor and destitute, all sorts of vile and corrupt business takes place in the depths of Black Kiergo, which speaks to the glory of Peryite almost perfectly! I can't wait to see the place for myself.\n\nDay One\n\nSenchal looks run down. Fire-scarred as well as flu-scarred, I hear. So many refugees. Bet they need work. Got to prove themselves worthy to eat. Perhaps this is a sign. I have plenty of work to hand out, thanks to Peryite. Not enough food here. And the Dragons, well, they just add to the whole ambiance. I like it.\n\nFound out Black Kiergo got flamed first during both the Thrassian Plague and the Knahaten Flu. Weak-minded fools. Putting flame to such things only gets you dead of breathing smoke. Promising for my purposes, I suppose.\n\nDay Two\n\nHeard some tales about this Rajhin thief fellow growing up in Black Kiergo. Also learned more about how people fear Black Kiergo if they don't live in it. It's the slums of this town. This place gets better and better. Time to head into this welcome darkness.\n\nTaking a moment to write what I've seen since this morning. And smelled. For a place that serves as the home of outlaws and scoundrels, Black Kiergo sure is spacious. I bet we could take over a corner and no one would even notice. Folk down here are a suspicious lot, but I like that about them. Trusting folk make my tusks itch. The smells, though. Just what you'd expect of a slum. I note them only because it reminds me of my time hiding out in Riften. Good times.\n\nCat-land history mentions a fellow named Keirgo who married someone and founded the nation. Got to make sure I spell that name right. Even though it sounds the same, it isn't spelled the same as the underground slums. This place and that fellow have no real connection. I found this out when I asked one of the locals about it and he put a knife to my throat. Nice to see they have pride in their heritage, but I did need to give the guy a bloody nose and a broken knife for my troubles. Praise Peryite!\n\nThese people need better blades, though. It shouldn't have broken so easily.\n\nDay Three\n\nGot a bit celebratory down in the arena area of Black Kiergo. Lots of strong drinks. Some of it was Elven backwash, but who cares after your twentieth or so flagon? And, yeah, the slums have an arena. More of a fighting pit, actually. A place for nobles to spend gold and bet on how much blood the poor people can spill. Kind of exciting, though. Heard some whispers about a cult that worships Dragons. Competition? I'll need to keep my ears open. Peryite's more than a Dragon, of course, but I wasn't expecting to have to compete for followers. Tusk it all, anyway!\n\nDay Four\n\nFound a nice place to set up shop. Need to send Reetza off to collect the rest of the group and bring them back here. She's been busy in Senchal proper, talking to the crowds and spreading the word of Peryite. We're striving for a mix of fun and work. Balance, you know. Peryite's not all pestilence and poverty, after all. Any illness he sends your way? Live through it and prove yourself strong, that's what I say! Too bad about some of those I sent to their graves for disagreeing with me. Seeing as how I'm still here and they aren't, I think my Prince agrees with me.\n\nI'm thinking of entering the arena while I'm waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. Haven't had a good fight in a long time, and maybe I can earn some gold along the way. Peryite knows we could use the funds! Wish me luck in Black Kiergo!
Thava-ko sings now a song of Riddle'Thar. Let its sweetest truth rest upon Thava-ko's tongue.\n\nOne of our people's greatest strengths lies in our flexibility. We do not jail free-thinkers as Dark Elves do. We do not decry salads as a blasphemy like the stubby acorn-worshipers of Valenwood. We do not pledge our souls only to eight dusty myths like the furless litters of long-dead Alessia. To be a Khajiit is to be free—free of cruel dogma, and free of bitter self-denial. Riddle'Thar does not kneel and mumble, it dances and sings! Ours is a faith rooted in joy, and faithful indulgence, and grinning charity. Alas, this strength often slides into shrugging disregard. We let our claws slip from the truth and wonder if "truth" even matters. Worship and transaction fall into eclipse. Well-earned relaxation gives way to a kitten's indolence. Our spirits grow poor. And a spirit so afflicted makes itself the perfect prey for the dro-m'Athra.\n\nAmun-dro's catalogue of spirits preys on the worst aspects of our carefree natures. Take the inclusion of Mafala, the Eight-Clawed. Were the bloody horrors of the Sinner Suicides not proof enough of her dark nature? Consider also the Tide-King, Hermorah. This document would have us believe that Azurah walks the dampened halls of his dark library as friend. If our distant mother does this, should we not do the same? No! For Khajiit who call on Hermorah's counsel risk a fate worse than death. Mumbles from the sea will tear a mind asunder as surely as the most potent skooma. His briny "truths" shred our sense of reality and set us adrift—far from ja-Kha'jay.\n\nWe must also consider who this catalog of spirits excludes. These books offer the rosiest descriptions of malevolent beings, but what of loving Mara and noble S'rendarr? This ancient zealot, Amun-dro, fails even to mention their names. And why? Because his aged theology offers no refuge for simple virtues like charity, humility, and love. Our beloved Rid-Thar-ri'Datta offered us more than Clan Mother tales—he offered us grace. In a world so crowded by great spirits and grand cosmic plans, where does the simple Khajiit rest his weary paws?  The Two-Moons Dance speaks plainly. It has no need for ancient conflicts—only simple precepts that lead to a life well-lived. In the end, a joyful life is the greatest gift of the Riddle'Thar.
By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion\n\nSouthern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarios gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. \n\nBOWS\n\nThe Khajiit have some … interesting ideas about archery. Still, there is always something to be learned. Like their bows, we adapted our own to be of finer metal, and began to see the promising (if not unsavory) uses of senche-gut bow-strings. The styling remains unique to our order however, with intricate carvings along the grip and distinctive colorings.
Ingredients:\n\n2 parts snow bear bile, boiled\n1 part dried shalk resin, finely ground\n1 part ashpit powder \n\nTo ensure a proper reaction in the stone's composition, ingredients must be mixed in the proper order and in the ratio specified. \n\nFirst create a base of snow bear bile, then slowly stir in the shalk resin until mixture turns foamy and light. Gently sprinkle in the ashpit powder, but be cautious not to over-mix the solution before use.\n\nWhen ready to use, shake vigorously and pour onto desired surface.
By Tazheq at-Rajd, Honored Scribe of Histories for the Pyre Watch\n\nDeath must be the end. The Pyre Watch requires each of its warriors uphold this demand. Those who come after may see piles of ash and bone in our charge and believe the task beneath them. "What danger," they may ask, "poses this dust?" But we who witnessed the horde of blood ghouls and man-beasts march upon the gates of Bangkorai remember. A horror rests within this Unhallowed Grave. Know well our order's arms and armor that give us the strength to defend the living. Because, the Gray Host shall not wake. Death must be the end.\n\nBOOTS\nThe Pyre Watch stands vigil to assure no one enters the Unhallowed Grave, and nothing leaves. We demand our warriors stay alert for any disturbance in the remains of our enemy. Focusing on the pain in your feet might distract at a crucial moment. And so, we craft our boots from supple leather to ensure prolonged comfort.

The blade's gentle curve reflects an elegant sleekness of all Bangkorai design. We keep them hidden but always at the ready, much like ourselves.
- The Sea Giant's campfire is more of a bonfire, but still not as massive as you might expect. Large enough for one, maybe two Giants to warm themselves comfortably.\n\n- The camp is small, relatively speaking. There can't possibly be more than one or two Giants here, unless the others enjoy sleeping in the snow.\n\n- Provisions appear scarce, relative to what a group of Giants might require. There is enough firewood on the ship for a few nights at most. There is very little food, but it is possible that they planned to hunt after reaching land.\n\n- I believe it's a very small contingent. Probably scouts like us, though not nearly as subtle or observant. I should be able to get a closer look without any trouble.
Transcribed and Annotated by Ysogar\n\n[Annotator's Note: I found this charred journal in the bottom of my grandmother Nan's memory chest. It isn't her handwriting, so it must have belonged to another relative. Her mother, perhaps? I transcribed and annotated it into a new journal, to better preserve it for posterity.]\n\nI recently started having strange dreams—they began on my first night in Solitude. All my life, I never dreamed. I had no idea what dreams really were, though others described them to me. Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me.\n\nBut here? I can only call them dreams because they have no resemblance to what's going around me when I'm awake. I'm writing them down to make better sense of them.\n\nMy first few dreams were set in Solitude, but I saw no buildings. Just the natural terrain. And the wind. So strong! I remember walking from the arch, then down the shore to a camp. Temporary shelters built out of fur and wood, but I saw no people. Where were they? They left behind burning cooking fires and half-eaten food.\n\n[This sounds like pre-Solitude days when the Nords made a makeshift camp along the Karth River, using the arch as a windbreaker. I've had a few dreams like this myself thanks to the stories Nan told.]\n\nAfter that, when I showed up where Solitude now stands—thank goodness for landmarks like the arch—some buildings sprouted up. Again, I saw nobody, but I heard nearby conversations about High King Erling, who had ordered the construction of a temple to the gods and wanted to start planning the walls. A woman named Thryrahilde championed a specific style for the walls, stating that not only would they be distinctive, but would afford better protection than the other plans presented. Her opposition called her by name, but I never heard their names. Lost to history?\n\nBecause clearly my dreams are taking me back into the past somehow. Just not fully. I don't see anyone. It's … so lonely in my dreams, except for the voices.\n\n[Traveling to the past in dreams? Nonsense. Also, none of the names of the original architects of Solitude made it through the generations in my family's stories. Regardless, I can't speak to the existence of Thryrahilde, but it is true that Solitude's outer walls are distinctive, and the temple in Castle Dour continues to hold a strong place in the hearts of our people.]\n\nIn my next dream, I'm watching priests blessing stones before masons add them to the wall. That was only one dream, but I received the impression that each and every stone received a blessing from the priests. Erling's voice drifted in and out, as if he was directly overseeing the process.\n\n[Nan does tell of how each stone was blessed by the gods. As far as I know, that is lore known only to my family. Did Nan get this from family tales or from this journal? I trust her more than this writer, so I think that information stands as true.]\n\nThe next night I watched the Blue Palace begin to take shape. As I stood within its half-finished corridors, I heard a screech and a clatter of tools.\n\n"There's a ghost! I saw her!"\n\nIt took a moment, but given the proximity of the voice, I could only ask: Does he mean me? Can he see me? Why can't I see him? Then I woke up abruptly and couldn't sleep again that night.\n\n[Odd. Perhaps this is someone's attempt at storytelling instead of an actual journal entry?]\n\nAs if to protect me from people who could see me, we leaped forward again in time. I say "we" because surely some other agency is at play here. This time, and over the next several nights, I saw the Bards College take shape. The very first bard walked across the finished threshold as a hazy shadow, accompanied by singing. I couldn't quite make out the words.\n\nBut I saw the shadow. And the shadow saw me. I woke up screaming this time.\n\n[I lose patience with this narrative presented as history.]\n\nThe next dream was a coronation. My guess? Olaf One-Eye. Why? Because in that same dream, I saw an effigy of this man burned. Just like the one they're burning tomorrow in the annual Burning of King Olaf, a local festival.\n\nHis eyes—both sets—burned into mine. Now I have burns over most of my body. They are healing, but I dare not sleep again. Not ever.\n\n[I'm not sure why Nan kept this journal among her things. It's nonsense—pieces of known history spun into dreams. Bah. But just in case, I spent the time to transcribe it.]\n\n[A few weeks have passed, and I'm dreaming about words catching alight, swirling around the one-eyed high king. This morning, I woke to the smell of my beard burning. It was charred. Tomorrow we burn King Olaf in effigy. I will seek out the Divines today and hope to free myself from whatever dream trap I've fallen into—before the festival. Why did I ever open that charred journal?]
This continuation of my travel journal, which focuses on the cheeses prevalent in the holds of Skyrim, explores a land and its cuisine that is as diverse as the multitude of flavors that danced across my tongue. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nRiftwash\nOnce reserved exclusively for the jarls of Riften, riftwash is a cheese with a glassy, violet-black exterior, which belies a pallid and crumbly core. As a goat's milk cheese, it is uncommon in the more temperate of Skyrim's climes. Pressed to remove much of the water within the cheese, unlike the goat's milk cheeses of Stormhaven, which the Bretons prize for moistness, riftwash is comparably dry.\n\nRumor says that the cheesemakers bathe wheels of riftwash in the muddy waters of Lake Honrich, which results in its dark hue.This is, of course, an outrageous falsehood. In truth, the cheese is washed several times in Riften's famous blackberry mead before being shrouded in wax which has been dyed with blackberry must, a by-product of the city's burgeoning meadworks. \n\nBarrowost\nThe people of Falkreath seem to earnestly appreciate their hold's longstanding association with battle and death. The shops, and indeed many families, draw their names and personal heraldry from the seemingly boundless graveyard that abuts the city. It is no surprise, perhaps, that one of Falkreath's most reputed cheeses relies on the dead for a key part of its production.\n\nBarrowost, or more commonly, barrow-cheese, much resembles the common eidar cheese found throughout the holds of Skyrim. Whereas eidar cheese is aged in cellars or caverns, however, barrowost is exclusively aged in barrows—the crumbling, draugr-infested tombs of Skyrim's dark past. Be it the stagnant air, the endlessly sweating stone, or the dark magic within its walls, the cheese gains an intense earthy sweetness, punctuated with sharp notes I find impossible to resist.\n\nAs an aside, I learned that Falkreath still practices an ancient Nord custom, the "grave curd." According to the practice, a fresh farmer's cheese is interred atop a loved one's coffin. Every year, on the anniversary of the departed's death, the grave curd is exhumed and a fifth of it is consumed by the bereaved. Many would balk at eating from a grave, but gods help me—the piece that was served to me was delicious!
At the behest of my correspondents, I have made great efforts to restrict the contents of my travel journal so as to not lose my reader's interest. In touring the holds of Skyrim, I was unsure through what lens I should present my travels. After a sumptuous meal at the start of my journey, I knew it must be food—and thus, my catalog of Skyrim's cheeses was born.\n\nThe land is as diverse as are its climes, and both mean the panoply of cheeses are vast. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nGreenedge\nGreenedge is a festive cheese, which I found to be rather peculiar due to the dour reputation of Hjaalmarch (and, in particular, its capital of Morthal). The name of the cheese, derived from the charming "baskets"—for there can be no other word for it—of rushes plucked from nearby bogs and woven together, speaks to both its visual appeal and the process of its creation. The cheese is brined and pressed within these baskets, with the latter process imbuing the rind of the normally cream-colored cheese with a verdant hue.\n\nThe way the locals eat the cheese is also curious. The consumption of Greenedge, customarily served at the end of feasts, has become something of a spectacle. Young hunters make a game of holding the rush-encased cheese over a flaming torch until its casing burns away and the cheese transforms into a near-molten state. Observers laud veterans of this ordeal for the showmanship they add to this feat, dancing the highly combustible cheese along the torch flame without pausing too long, lest the cheese blacken or their fingers burn.\n\nThus prepared, they flip the hot cheese onto a table and guests immediately plunge bread—or, occasionally, sliced apples—into the melted goodness. Children find particular joy in the activity, for at this point the cheese's secret contents are revealed—dried fruits and berries, and (in wealthier households) a single amber plum. The lucky eater that spears the plum before all others is named king of the feast.\n\nSolitude Eidar\nThe greatest of the cheeses in Skyrim, in my opinion, is Solitude Eidar. Not because of its flavor or bizarre nature, but for its extreme rarity. Solitude Eidar is, as the name implies, an eidar cheese, being aged and inoculated with the spores of some fungus. And, like eidar, it is aged underground, in this case in the vaults below the ancient city. But here the similarities to regular eidar end.\n\nFirst the source. Solitude Eidar is a masterful translation of Western Skyrim's staunch traditionalism to the practice of cheese-making, and this starts with the milk. Only cows that belonged to the herd of Jarl Svartr, first king of Western Skyrim, can provide milk for the cheese. The royal herd, descended from these cows, is maintained by loyal retainers. Milk arrives regularly in Solitude, where it undergoes inspection by a royal cheesemonger—a hereditary office within the Blue Palace. This connoisseur of dairy has exacting standards for the milk he inspects—indeed, for I have seen him—and only one out of every dozen barrels is deemed fit for the making of Solitude Eidar. The milk curdles in a precise fashion, using a series of hourglasses custom-made for the purpose. Lastly, they add a crumb of cheese from the previous batch into the next one—thus creating an unbroken chain of eidar dating back generations.\n\nThe result is, as I am led to understand, a cheese that has the precise appearance, aroma, and taste as it had in Svartr's day. I was skeptical until I was given two pieces of cheese, one preserved from decades ago, and one only recently cut from its rind. I was instructed to sample both and see if I could tell the difference.\n\nI could not, and I wept.
By Captain Thromkir of the Blackreach Vanguard of Dusktown\n\nThe few brave enough to venture to Blackreach found themselves in need of specialized protection early on. While this place remains unpredictable, it has a wealth of resources that are easily harvested and can be turned against it. Much of the process is still trial and error, but it's been refined to a point where I believe it's pertinent to take record of. I imagine the longer people exist in Blackreach, the more nuanced these practices will become. \n\nMACES\nThe best defense against some of these crawlies is a big hunk of metal to the face! We take a lot of inspiration from Nord maces that were brought down with us from the surface for the actual head of the weapon itself. We use our own special flair when it comes to the decorations along the metal, and the top of the shaft is adorned with thick sheets of chaurus chitin.

The wood gets brought down from the surface, but the metal and reinforcements are made from resources exclusively gathered from Blackreach. Ridges made from the backs of chaurus protrude from the face of the shield to provide additional strength.
Pentarch Khorb,\n\nThe mining consortium is in place and ready for your use. None of these stupid miners have any idea what they have unwittingly signed on for, nor do they truly know the extent of the majestic terrain spread before them.\n\nThey will do the work and guard their secrets closely, ensuring our own secrets remain undiscovered in the darkness below. We shall continue to replenish the workers periodically, so feel free to dine or send them to your alchemist as you see fit.\n\nAnd when the time comes to perform the ritual, they will be in place to provide the energy we need.\n\nSister Tharda
By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude \n\nThe Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.\n\nGLOVES\nDark leather makes the hands of the Gray Host near invisible in the night. You might catch a flash of gold under the moonlight before a killing blow, but that is all.
By Captain Viddgryr, Guard of Solitude \n\nThe Gray Host needs little introduction. The ancient army, risen anew, plagues our lands with little regard for the lives they take. I believe it is important for us to know our enemy. Many have clashed blades with these terrors, but are woefully misinformed about their weapons and armor. Here, I intend to make a detailed account of everything we know about the Gray Host's armaments in hopes that those who read will be better prepared.\n\nHELMET\nDark onyx-colored plating makes up the helms of the Gray Host. Sharp horns, like those of a Dragon, stud the crown. Gold accents flare out like wings across the visor. Some faces are left open, others concealed so only a flash of animalistic eyes can be seen within. The word most commonly brought to mind when viewing these helms is … sharp.
With the need for armed combatants to fight against the Alessian Empire, armor and weapon artisans like yourselves craft tirelessly. Unfortunately, your varied artistic visions rob the army of a cohesive aesthetic. As every Elf knows, war without grace is the province of men. I, for one, cannot abide such a comparison. Therefore, all smiths must henceforth adhere to the specific style, outlined below, when fashioning arms and armor.\n\n—Raven Direnni\n\nGLOVES\n\nSoldiers must perform many functions with ease while in the field. Work to provide as much articulation within gloves, without sacrificing protection. None should complain of chafing, inability to fully perform their favored killing move, and so on.
By High Priest Ingurt\n\nNord religion has taken a number of interesting turns over the centuries. Our earliest beliefs were thought to have originated in Atmora and revolved around the worship of animal totems. These animals—Dragon, Hawk, She-Wolf, Snake, Moth, Owl, Whale, Bear, and Fox—seem to correspond to the Eight Divines plus Lorkhan. Later, the Dragon rose to prominence and gave rise to the Dragon Cult. It was either during or soon after the move to Tamriel that the Dragon Cult became more malevolent and forced its will throughout the land. It took the Dragon War to overthrow the Dragons and their priests, but that's a tale for another time.\n\nEventually, the animal-totem gods transformed into the eight gods we worship today. We call them by their true names: Alduin, Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, Jhunal, Orkey, and Shor. We understand that our gods are as cyclical as the world itself, so we also remember the Dead Gods (Shor and Tsun) who fought and died to bring about the current world, the Hearth Gods (Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, and Jhunal) who watch over the present cycle, and the Twilight God (Alduin) who ushers in the next cycle. Add to these our so-called Testing Gods, who we do not worship but instead guard against to protect the hearth. These include Orkey, Mauloch, and Herma-Mora.\n\nWhen the Imperials arrived, they brought with them their southern religion and worked to unify the worship of the Eight Divines. That's how we got this wonderful Temple of the Divines that graces our fair city of Solitude. We agree with the general notion that there are eight gods, more or less, but we view them quite differently and call them by different names. Our temple has adjusted to the needs and desires of the current rulers time and again, yet we have grown used to some of the more prominent Imperial notions and practices even though we no longer find ourselves beholden to the Ruby Throne.\n\nProbably our biggest difference relates to the head of the pantheon. We Nords consider Kyne as the leader of the gods and find the Imperial fascination with Alduin (who they call Akatosh) to be both perplexing and mildly disturbing. We work diligently to keep Alduin asleep, while our southern neighbors try time and time again to get his attention! Which is why I begin every service in the temple with a prayer to praise Alduin (oh great god of time!), followed by a prayer to keep him at bay (may your slumber stretch on for a thousand generations!).
By Cassia Volcatia, Traveling Scribe\n\nWelcome back, dear reader, to another volume of "Scary Tales." This time we explore the remote wilds of the Reach, specifically the fierce and uninviting Druadach Mountains area. The barbaric Reachfolk are as reclusive and perplexing as they are dangerous, and these tales were not gathered without significant risk.\n\nYet once again, through your seasoned storyteller's charm, quick wit, and ability to run very fast, I have escaped to bring you, my readers in the Imperial City and beyond, accounts of the unconfirmed and the unexplained. Now settle in, grab a drink, light your lantern, and read on—if you dare!\n\n* * *\nThe Wolf with the Daedric Howl\n\nOur first account of the unexplained comes from survivors of a Redguard merchant caravan, who endured a callous calamity of cataclysmic proportions while hauling a load of fine rugs and carpets from Dragonstar to Solitude. Our soon-to-be-imperiled group of unsuspecting carpet carriers set out from Dragonstar at the end of Rain's Hand, hoping to take advantage of a shortage of noble finery in Solitude that particular season. The caravan consisted of two Crown merchants protected by eight seasoned sellswords led by Captain Hakmir, the Blade of Bergama.\n\nThe merchants told of an odyssey that seemed cursed from the start. Not a moment after they crossed the border into the Reach their caravan was beset by the worst of storms—a steady, driving rain that continued for days on end. Even the Redguard wagons and their sturdy horses, strong and hardy from dragging wagons through the sand, had trouble keeping pace in the mirthless and muddy conditions. Despite the best efforts of caravaneers and horses, the caravan fell days behind. Yet this troubling inconvenience became all the more sinister when two of Captain Hakmir's sellswords vanished in the night!\n\nThere was no call of alarm from the vanished, and no bodies found the next day. Yet the night before their fellows vanished, all the caravan survivors recall waking to the mournful howl of a single wolf. It was a howl so terrifying and dreadful that it woke all who huddled fitfully in their rain-soaked tents. It left them awake long after the howl faded. A howl, they said, like a Daedra's roar.\n\nThe rain slacked by morning, yet search as they might, the other six members of the caravan's escort simply could not find any footprints or other signs of their missing brethren. Two seasoned Crown warriors simply vanished, as if taken by the very storm that plagued the caravan! Or taken by a Daedric wolf?\n\nThe lead merchant counseled caution. Should the caravan turn back? But Captain Hakmir, confident in his skills and determined to find his missing soldiers, assured the merchants they could press ahead. So press ahead they did, only to have the driving storm replaced by the worst of fogs. One merchant told your chronicler that the fog grew so thick she couldn't see her fingers in front of her face!\n\nWorse, the survivors shared, were the howls. Brazen and unrelenting, the same terrifying howl that had awoken the caravan the night the first sellswords disappeared was heard again and again during the day, erupting from the fog, and always too far away to trace. The sellswords closed ranks, cursing and muttering among themselves, waiting to defend themselves. But no attack came. As the caravan plodded on, they grew certain the howling was just some wicked trick of the Reach. The barbaric clans of the Reach would never dare attack six Crown Redguards on the road. Such seasoned warriors would not be taken by surprise again!\n\nThe night after the fog rolled in, Captain Hakmir declared that his sellswords would sleep in shifts, three on and three off, until first light. His plan seemed sound until, once again, in the darkest of the fog-filled night, the wolf's Daedric howl split the night. All in the camp awoke at once, and Captain Hakmir called to his soldiers in the dark. Yet none responded. With the grimmest of glares, the Blade of Bergama ordered his last two soldiers not to leave the caravan under any circumstances, then drew his giant blade. Hakmir strode into the fog to face the Daedric wolf and learn the fate of his companions.\n\nAnd the brave Captain Hakmir, your tarried teller of tales must tragically report, never returned.\n\nThe fog remained the next morning, joined by another forceful rain, and soon an axle on one of the hardy Redguard wagons snapped. How could this be? The wagons were repaired and fortified in Dragonstar before they departed! Left with the prospect of plodding on for two weeks beset by storms, fog, and this wraithlike, wayward wolf, the Crown merchants made the decision to abandon their wagons and rush on to Solitude by horse. Carpets and silk, they declared, were not worth the deaths of those still alive!\n\nAs soon as the party left the wagons, riding two astride each horse with the last animal carrying what possessions they could salvage, the deadly fog lifted. A tense four days later, the survivors arrived in Solitude, bereft of their abandoned wealth but otherwise unharried and unharmed.\n\nYet Captain Hakmir and the six brave sellswords who vanished have not been heard from since. Only the memory of the Daedric wolf remains, seared into the minds of all who heard its howl. A wolf made of storm and fog, stealing the unwary in the night and then vanishing, like its victims, into the shadows of the Druadach Mountains.
By Glabrian Tuliel, University of Gwylim\n(Written during the reign of Emperor Leovic, 2E 564)\n\nFor centuries, the Reach and its inhabitants have been mysteries to the rest of Tamriel. The establishment of an Imperial governor in Markarth, however, signals a new era for the Reach and its peoples. The scholars and travelers of Tamriel can finally venture into the Reach and perhaps come to understand the Reachfolk and their ways.\n\nWith that goal in mind, I undertook the journey to Markarth in the spring of 2E 560, carrying a letter of introduction from Emperor Moricar. Governor Caddach (not without misgivings) helped me obtain a guide—a young warrior named Duinal—to introduce me to the Eagleseers, one of the friendlier Reach clans. Five days' travel brought us to the Eagleseers' dhun (a fortified hilltop village, common in the hinterlands). Duinal explained my mission, and I was received by Chief Darragh and his close advisor, the witch Aislin. At first, Darragh seemed puzzled by my intentions, and Aislin frankly regarded me with contempt. I believe the only reason they permitted me to stay was that Darragh thought it might be useful to have Caddach owe him a small favor.\n\nWe arrived in early spring and found preparations underway for a ceremonial hunt. The first of the season, it seemed. The clan's food stores were low after a long winter, but the snow was finally melting and a large party of hunters was making ready to leave. The night before the hunters set out, the clan gathered for a ceremony seeking Hircine's favor. Wild dances represented the chase and the kill, a rather violent spectacle that I found unsettling—invoking a Daedric Prince for any reason seemed reckless to me. Aislin and her sisters presided over the whole affair. At the height of the ceremony, she commanded clan warriors to take me away. The secret rites that followed were evidently not for the eyes of an outsider. I never did learn anything more about it.\n\nThe ceremony (whatever it was) evidently met with Hircine's approval, for the hunt went well. I remained with the Eagleseers for two weeks after the hunters returned, observing their lifestyle. They are a bawdy, plain-spoken people, and some of them went out of their way to see if they could intimidate or shock me. However, the fact that I was under Chief Darragh's protection seemed to shield me from the worst of that sort of thing. With my stocks of paper and ink running low—and conscious of the fact that I did not wish to wear out my welcome—I offered gifts of some small trinkets I brought with me, said farewell, and made my way back to Markarth.\n\nWhen I returned to the Eagleseers in midsummer, I was surprised to find the clan's dhun half-empty. I learned that they had moved their flocks to the high pastures and many of their folk had established temporary camps to watch over their valuable livestock. Reachfolk do not steal from other Reachfolk unless the clans are feuding, but the mountains are home to ogres, trolls, and other dangerous beasts, so the flocks must be constantly guarded. Other Eagleseers had left to set up fishing camps along nearby rivers, or had gone to Markarth to trade. It was a busy time, yet different from my previous visits.\n\nMy third visit in the fall showed me yet another aspect of clan life. Like most Reach clans, the Eagleseers sow no fields and look forward to no autumn harvest. They do, however, gather wild roots and berries, preparing for the winter to come. Smokehouses were full of meat being preserved, as this is the time of year when the Eagleseers cull their herds, slaughtering the livestock they need to sustain themselves through the cold months. I brought many useful gifts from Markarth this time—knives, blankets, and such—and made a point of joining in the clan's work at every opportunity. The Eagleseers seemed to be growing accustomed to my presence.\n\nFour months later, I returned in midwinter, a difficult and dangerous journey in the snow. I was anxious to see how my friends among the Eagleseers—for by now I had a few—were getting along. Winter, I had learned, is the season for crafting tools, clothes, and toys. Hunters try their luck as weather and game permit, but most people survive on the food they were able to store away in summer and fall. To my dismay, I found the Eagleseers grieving and furious. \n\nThree days before my return, warriors of the Six-Fords clan had waylaid an Eagleseer hunting party and killed Chief Darragh. Apparently the Six-Fords and Eagleseers have been engaged in a feud for years over some old insult. The two clans pursue their quarrel in fits and starts, but winter is the season for feuding and raiding. Aislin openly blamed me for Darragh's death: the old chief's welcome of a soft outlander had angered the hard gods of the Reach, and they had shown their displeasure. I left shortly thereafter, feeling unsafe among the clan.\n\nRegardless, I learned much during my year with the Eagleseer clan.
Master Pythis instructed me to keep a journal of our research for our records. I have never been much for journaling, but I imagine I will spend most of these pages drawing the various specimens instead of writing about them. I think illustrations are more instructional than mere words. Perhaps because I am not much of a writer.\n\nBut it seems Master Pythis believes in me. A fact that does not cease to bewilder me every time I encounter it. His work with botany has inspired me for quite some time. When he offered to become my mentor, I was at a loss for words. Why would someone as well-established as he is want to waste time teaching a new recruit like me? I am incredibly grateful, of course. It's a dream come true.\n\nHe tends to be quiet. Not unkind, but not overly warm, either. Which is fine for me since I tend to be fairly quiet myself. I merely hope that his propensity for silence is not out of sullenness toward his new apprentice.\n\nThe master's been fairly secretive about our newest project. I've noticed that many of the other Psijics don't take botany quite as seriously as he and I do. I don't mind too much. I find it's better for any group when their interests and talents are varied. But I think Master Pythis keeps our research mostly between the two of us because we have true passion for it. He hasn't said outright that the others wouldn't understand (and I certainly haven't found that to be the case when talking to them) but I get the sense he would rather they stay out of our affairs.
By Arana of the Ghostsong Clan (as recorded by Count Verandis Ravenwatch)\n\nAs the Gray Host stalks our lands and preys upon our clans, the Despot of Markarth demands we freehands of the Reach come to heel and kiss his feet for the privilege of cowering in his cave of Dwarven stone. Fie on that, I say! But there's one thought the ard has betwixt his ears that's worth heeding: the deepfolk's bones are strong and they litter our lands. We must make use of them.\n\nThough I know not what Dwarves saw in the stars, I've seen how they marked the stone with the signs of our guardians in the sky. If the deepfolk sought the protection of the Witch, Hunter, and Headsman to create their otherworldly works, let us turn that strength against our equally unnatural foes.\n\nSTAVES\nWitch work and the Dwarf mischief mix like oil and water. Even Mora may not know how it is the deepfolk worked their will, but while that remains a mystery, I know all too well how a hunk of their metal will split a skull.
By Fortis Scaeva, Chief of Operations\n\nWelcome to the service of House Hexos! You now are part of a mercantile empire that extends far into the myriad realms of Oblivion. From our emporium in Fargrave, our agents pursue the goods of a dozen worlds and arrange for their delivery to discerning buyers throughout Tamriel.\n\nNaturally, our enterprise comes with certain risks. This is why we hire mercenaries such as you. Fargrave is safe enough, but our merchants require escorts to the strange realms in which they do business. The best practice is to deter attacks with conspicuously well-armed troops. But when deterrence fails, we must be ready to fight.\n\nSince we venture into hostile environments, House Hexos issues weapons treated to remain useful in storms of ash, corrosive swamps, or bitter icefields. And we expect mercenaries in our service to proudly wear the colors of our house: olive green, brown leather, emblems of deep red. In many planes, our safe-passage agreements require us to identify ourselves. Discard our colors at your peril!\n\nAXES\nMany of the creatures we encounter are ill-tempered beasts armored in thick carapaces or scales. It takes a heavy blade to cut through the hide of a monster such as a Daedroth or an Infernium. A Hexos axe also features a haft of steel alloy, since wooden hafts often split or rot in the harsher planes.
What a glorious day! As my Prince commanded, I allied myself with the Reachman Durcorach, also known as the Black Drake, and brokered a deal that will see the powerful barbarian crowned emperor and placed upon the Ruby Throne.\n\nNow begins the true work. The endless preparations. The rituals. Everything that must be done to make ready for the Four Ambitions of Mehrunes Dagon. We will perform our tasks and wait for the day when the final part of the arrangement will be carried out and Mehrunes Dagon will claim his due.\n\nAll praise the Prince of Destruction! All praise the Prince of Change!
By Cassia Hiriel, Outfitter and Artisan\n\nOurs is a simple task: Pyroturge Encratis requests attire that will allow our agents to infiltrate and destroy their target. As you may expect, the Pyroturge's preferred method for eradicating evidence of True-Sworn presence will consist of burning down the entire villa. To that end, I have designed armor that will protect against the raging inferno that will result. You will also find plans for new weapons among my designs. The item we seek holds great value and we must be the only ones to obtain it. Arming ourselves properly ensures this outcome and advance our timeline.\n\nAXES\n\nAs the fires rage and consume the villa, you may encounter falling debris that blocks your escape. The thick iron and strong bronze that form the axes will cut through any timber to clear your path. The blade itself comes to a sharp point along the bottom edge, which shall also provide the ability to tear at armor.\n\nBELTS\n\nLoose clothes in a blaze are obviously not ideal. No need to catch fire due to a flapping tunic. Cinch these hard leather belts tight to protect yourself. I have added carrier loops around the waist so you can attach incendiary tonics with ease.\n\nBOOTS\n\nOur agents will need speed to accomplish their mission, as well as stealth to evade the creatures within the villa. Each pair of boots provided are made from a thick guar leather that insulates against the heat. The soles use a lining of my own concoction that will not melt under the hottest conditions.\n\nBOWS\n\nCurved ash wood reinforced with steel on the grip offer flexibility and strength to the archer. Be cautious about the flames licking the wood. The quiver offers even more carrying capacity for your incendiary tonics, which should make flaming arrows especially easy.\n\nCHEST PIECES\n\nI chose a darker color scheme for this attire to increase our agents' capability for remaining hidden during the mission. The dark brown leather on the chest is highly flexible, even in the heavier versions. And the deep blue cloth at the joints increase movement. Thick cloth covers the chest and neck area to protect against cinders floating within the air.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nSimple yet noble was my goal for our weapon design; and even the treacherous daggers maintain this feel. The blades are etched with an elegant pattern of my own design. The hilt and guard are coated in bronze for strength.\n\nGLOVES\n\nFull-length gloves were imperative for this armor. If you have yet to experience the Pyroturge's art, then know that he excels at generating heat of amazing intensity. While our agents seek their target, we cannot expose their hands to the dangers of these flames.\n\nHELMETS\n\nI admit to my own cleverness in these designs. The guar leather masks cover the entire face for purposes of anonymity and protection. However, I have added lenses made of amber that filter the bright flames they will encounter. They limit peripheral vision somewhat, but the sacrifice should be worth it.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nDespite my warnings, our magic-using agents insist on loose clothing around their legs. This is tradition among their kind, so I accommodated as I could. The cloth is heavy and weighted down around the hem so as not to billow out. The more sensible leg armor uses supple leathers occasionally clad in dark steel.\n\nMACES\n\nI am partial to two-headed mace designs due to the balance. Additionally, in the heat of battle, having twice the options for damage improves survivability. Use the thickest steel we have for the head and handles. We cannot afford for these to snap under pressure.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nA classic design that I acquired from books given to me by our benefactor. I believe it originates from the First Era. Rounded shields with heavy riveted rims offer the best strength and protection while maintaining portability. We do not want to slow the agents in their task.\n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nI chose leather pauldrons in most cases in order to stay as flexible as possible. We do not need to weigh down our people any more than necessary. The look of them stays understated. The True-Sworn need not show off their allegiances.\n\nSTAVES\n\nWhile many staff-users prefer wood for their weapons, that would not work in this case for obvious reasons. Bronze-coated steel forms the core of each staff, notched along the center for a better grip. The head is pointed in almost a trident shape. This is pragmatic—if the wielder needs move flaming material from their path, a forked design will assist in that.\n\nSWORDS\n\nMany sword designers of this era prefer ostentatious hand guard and blade designs. I find this foolish. A simple, strong weapon engenders as much fear as any eccentric appearance. That said, etch the blade carefully. I am told this symbol comes from out benefactor and should not be altered.
Pardon my caution, but curious eyes are everywhere.\n\nI have information that you desperately need to know about. Things I learned since our time in that strange ruin.\n\nCome to the Amnis Manor on the south side of Gideon. Just you and the Wood Elf.\n\nTell no one else. I ask for your utmost discretion here and that you trust me. Not everyone will believe that my intentions are sincere.
In my efforts to become the greatest vossa-satl musician in all of Tamriel, I need to find the very best frogs. The nisswo told me that the frogs that frolic around the pristine pool located in the very depths of Vunalk's ruins produce the most beautiful frog songs in all of Blackwood. I simply must find these frogs and hear their melodies for myself!\n\nSo far I've been able to avoid the various creatures that inhabit these ruins, but I'm surprised I haven't encountered the Nereid yet. I really want to talk to her and ask her permission before I take any of the frogs. If she loves music as much as I, I'm sure she'll be reasonable.

By Captain Rian Liore\nA guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Ivory Brigade style\n\nThroughout history, the city of Leyawiin has been able to rely upon the protection of the Imperial Legion. Alas, those days appear to be over. With the collapse of Imperial authority and power, each province of the Empire has been left to look after itself. If we are to protect Leyawiin from the depredations of pirates or invasions by the warring alliances contending for the Ruby Throne, we must raise an army of our own—an army of the Blackwood—to deter aggression and keep the peace.\n\nAs the commander of Leyawiin's forces, the task of organizing this new army has fallen to me. I have always felt that the first step in making soldiers is to teach new recruits that they serve something greater than themselves, and to take pride in that service. To put on a uniform is to proclaim an allegiance and forge a bond of loyalty with those who wear that same uniform. At the same time, a prudent commander must consider the tools his soldiers will need to carry out their duties, and the resources available. To that end, I will now enumerate my expectations for the proper equipping of the army of Leyawiin.\n\nFor our coat of arms, I have selected an ivory horse on a field of green, the ancient symbol of Leyawiin. And from this brave device our army takes its name: the Ivory Brigade, defenders of the good folk of Blackwood.\n\nAXES\nAxes come in many different patterns, but the axe of the Ivory Brigade is a single-bitted weapon with a brass haft designed to stand up to damage in battle. Opposite the blade is a reinforced beak that can pierce the heaviest armor.

By Professor Astinia Bincal, University of Gwylim, Anthropology Department\n\nI feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose "dark secrets" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as "On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians." However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.\n\nHELMETS\nEach headpiece holds a scowling death mask carved from a bright jade. If the intent is to intimidate, they succeed. Some will sport massive curving horns like the claws of some great crab. In the interest of academics, I admit that when I close my eyes, these faces haunt me still.
After the ouster of Count Geraldi of Daggerfall for espousing veneration for the Daedric Prince Meridia, the Knights of the Silver Rose were tasked with rooting out any heretical items or persons from his holdings. While most of the count's servants proved to be Divine fearing people, the order discovered that the cadre of artists with whom the count offered patronage were not so pure. Among the cult's possessions was an engraved opal about the size of a hen's egg. The stone was set in gold and hung from a chain. Mages of our order immediately identified it as immensely magically, radiating chromatic light capable of illuminating its entire shrine even while sitting idly on its altar. \n\nI have further assessed the charm and found it to be capable or far more than a pretty light show. The stone is deeply connected to Meridia's realm and the light it emits is pulled directly from the Colored Rooms. With some mastery the charm can project objects at a distance made from light. They are not simple illusions, but physical conjurations made from the energies of the Colored Rooms. These conjurations tend to dissipate quickly without devoting considerable focus to maintain them. \n\nAnother less obvious property of the charm is its hold over the living, the Lady of Life and Light does love her conformity after all. The Opal Charm can unify the life forces of living things, as we discovered during the attempted executions of the cultists. Until we were able to finally kill the artifact's bearer—the count as it turned out—with considerable effort, none of the others bound to the charm would succumb to their wounds. We were fortunate such a powerful object did not find its way into the hands of a more formidable enemy before we confiscated it. \n\nCataloged by Chief Archivist Bartholomew

From the memoirs of Sentanus Marillin, aide to the Elder Council\n\nThe first time I appeared before the Longhouse Emperors was when I was a young man, an apprentice aide to the Imperial Elder Council, shortly after Durcorach the Black Drake rose to power. It was an uncertain time, trying to reconcile Imperial methods and traditions with the reality of rule by a ruthless and savage Reachfolk. I remember standing behind the councilor I served, trying not to show how badly my hands were shaking as I prepared the quills, ink, and parchments for the Emperor's daily decrees. As frightened as I was—for I had heard all the stories about how the Black Drake conquered our Empire—I couldn't help but notice how hard Emperor Durcorach was trying. He obviously had no formal education and knew precious little of the culture or protocols of the Imperial court, but he wanted to carry himself as an Imperial. He demanded to be taught the proper procedures, and despite his clear unease and frustration, he only had one aide killed during that audience. An act which, incidentally, allowed me to complete my apprenticeship early. As an aide, I only had the privilege of standing before Durcorach a handful of times. Despite how hard he tried, he could never divest himself of his crude and violent nature.\n\nThe Black Drake's son and successor, Moricar, was a different story. He combined the characteristics of both the Reach and Cyrodiil in a strong and capable leader. Raised with an Imperial education that blunted but could not completely erase his Reach upbringing, Emperor Moricar could engage in the political nuances of the Imperial court while also demonstrating the ferocity and ruthlessness that made his father so feared. But Moricar's fear included a grudging respect. He was more than a savage playing at Emperor. He ruled with both his physical prowess and his cunning mind. I saw both in action the first day I entered his throne room. He was locked in a debate with his mentor, Abnur Tharn, and Councilor Lovidicus, arguing the best way to bring the province of High Rock under control after Durcorach's death campaigning in that region. He listened to Tharn and Lovidicus each present the risks and benefits of different options. He considered for a few moments. Then ordered me to prepare a decree declaring that the Daggerfall Covenant would be considered an independent and sovereign nation, and commanded Tharn to negotiate peace along the Empire's western border. "We cannot afford to throw more lives away trying to subjugate that obstinate region. It was my father's quagmire. I shall not let it be mine."\n\nI was a much older senior aide when Moricar's son, Leovic, ascended to the Ruby Throne. Here was another student of Abnur Tharn's, but one who was raised totally within the Imperial mindset. He had visited the Reach rarely, having grown up knowing primarily the abundances and excesses of life in the Imperial epicenter. Of the Longhouse Emperor's, he was the most cosmopolitan. The most Imperial. Some considered him weak and over-educated. Even spoiled. But he had the same core of iron as his father and grandfather. He just hid it inside a velvet glove. My first meeting with him after he took the throne was a revelation. His court felt more like the courts that existed before the rise of the Longhouse Emperors. There was hardly any mention of the Reach or the practices of the Reachfolk. At least, not that first time. Later, my visits (which were much more frequent now that I was a senior aide) to the throne took on a new perspective as Leovic began to embrace his heritage. Initially, it looked like some sort of passing fancy: the Reach fetishes, the demands for the kitchen to retrieve the recipes preferred by Durcorach and Moricar. And then things took a darker turn, when Leovic had idols and shrines to the Daedric Princes installed around the throne room. He was definitely becoming obsessed with a tradition and culture he had no intimate experience with. And that obsession, I'm afraid, led to his eventual doom.
Please, whoever finds this. Protect my precious at all costs. Comfort them. Take them away from this awful place.\n\nI tried my best, but was unable to complete the task. Don't leave my precious in this terrible place.\n\nPlease.\n\nToomon
by Doombringer Celdina\n\nThe Order of the Waking Flame welcomes all who seek to remake their lives. We come to Mehrunes Dagon's service from many lands and different walks of life, and yet in the eyes of the Mighty Prince, all that we once were is of no importance. Brokenness, failure, disappointment, grief—it matters not. What Lord Dagon teaches us is how to use the things we are given.\n\nAllow me to tell you my own story, my novices. This is my testament.\n\nWhen I was young—and it does seem so very long ago—I was abandoned by unworthy parents. I found shelter at the Priory of the Golden Staff. Followers of Magnus, God of the Sun and Great Architect, they cared for me and educated me. \n\nFor a time I was happy there. The acolytes of the priory taught me of Magnus's grand design for the Mundus, and his disappointment at the flaws introduced into his creation. One old monk even showed me forbidden texts that revealed a darker design. Some of the Magna Ge once sought a tool to unmake what had been made wrong, in order that it could be remade in accordance with the Architect's plan.\n\nThis confused me. The world was sweet and young in my eyes, and I did not see how it would be any kind of mercy to undo it. Then, in my sixteenth year, the Reach horde of the Black Drake came, bringing his war against High Rock.\n\nThe Reachfolk burned my priory. They slaughtered my brothers and ravished my sisters, before slaughtering them too. By mere chance, I survived, only to be dragged away as captive to the Reachfolk. For months they kept me, a helpless drudge in their camp. And I learned the truth of the world's flaw. Suffering is all that awaits us.\n\nWhen the horde finally broke up, my Reach captors simply discarded me. They destroyed my home, my family. Unmade it. So I ran. But I held onto my anger, my thirst for vengeance, and I recalled the story of the Magna Ge and the tool that could unmake this flawed world: Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Destruction. I sought out his followers in the Order of the Waking Flame and found truth in their teachings that had been hidden from me. And in that truth, I began to see a way to enact my vengeance on this imperfect world.\n\nAnd so I worship our lord and master, and work diligently every day to see his will done. For now I know that only through Mehrunes Dagon will the perfected work of the Great Architect and the hope of the Magne Ge be brought into being.
There is no greater honor than to serve the most unique city in all of the planes. Follow these instructions carefully and you will join the ranks of those who dedicate their existence to something greater than themselves.\n\nFirstly, gather gold, blue, and silver materials. Gold for the wealth of Fargrave; the gold in the treasuries belongs to the city and must be protected. Blue for the beauty shining in Fargrave's eternal sky, in protecting this, a Guardian gains honor in their service. Silver ties Guardians together, creating a lasting bond throughout all Fargrave Guardians. \n\nAXES\nThe head of the axe is a half-circle with jagged points of metal reaching toward the axe's grip. The shape resembles a golden storm cloud. When used, the destructive force rained down upon those who threaten Fargrave will be as severe and fatal as a bolt of lightning.\n\nBELTS\nCut a swatch of blue fabric into strips and wrap them around the waist. This serves as a reminder of the duty all Guardians uphold. The wrappings ground each Guardian secure them with the firm belief necessary to face those who threaten Fargrave. Add adornments to the belt if desired. \n\nBOOTS\nFootwear provides a sturdy foundation of all movements made throughout Fargrave. Footwear does not guarantee comfort. Keep this rule in mind when shaping the metal and fashioning the boots—stability in each step over comfort.\n\nBOWS\nWrap the bow with blue fabric, styling it similarly to the configuration on the chest plate. Do the same to the quiver. Both items represent the surety of aim; for none who use them waver in their commitment to the Stricture.\n\nCHESTS\nFashion the chest piece out of thick leathers and twist two lengths of blue fabric across the front. The blue ties act as chains, remaining fixed to heart of the Guardian's being, reminding them of all Fargrave offers. \n\nDAGGERS \nThe dagger's balance allows it to penetrate armor, scales, hide, and fur in one fell swoop. Visitors to Fargrave hail from across the realms and the short blade acts as a fatal deterrent to all who seek to destroy it from within. \n\nGLOVES\nLayer small plates of metal to protect the extremities of the hand and protect the palm with strips of leather. While other pieces of this revered garb may sacrifice comfort, the fingers of a guardian must be dexterous enough to catch a scampering banekin thief. \n\nHELMETS\nGuardians are indistinguishable from one another. A new guardian must have their horns shaved down, removing all trace of the individual so that the guardians appear as one uniform collective with the same, sharp, horns. \n\nLEG GREAVES\nRather than having the spiked portion of the greave facing outward—a cowardly attempt at intimidation that holds denizens of Fargrave at bay—curve the point upward, towards the knee. While attacking outsiders is noble, the first priority in an attack is to keep Fargrave standing. \n\nMACES\nThe mace head resembles the intricate stonemasonry of Fargrave. The might and weight of the very walls themselves are felt in every blow a Guardian strikes. To this end, be sure to embed a piece of the city's wall in the mace itself. It will lend Fargrave's strength to the blow.\n\nSHIELDS\nThough there is need for them, there is little honor in wielding a shield against an enemy of Fargrave. As such, do not use the blue fabric except as a ribbon to secure the shield to the arm. Instead stand proudly and know that one more body will not hinder the city's elite force.\n\nSHOULDERS\nMake the metal plates of the shoulder pad spiked and wide, for the Guardians bear the weight of Fargrave on their shoulders. Each shoulder plate must be curved away from the flesh of the arm.  The upturned crescent shape grants us an unmistakable silhouette in thar dark alleys of the city. \n\nSTAVES\nOut of all the weapons, utilize the most azure fabric in the making of a staff. These weapons will hold the enemies of Fargrave at bay and keep them distanced from the city. They are regal, pointed, and can be used in a variety of situations. In the past, the staves propped up fallen bazaar stalls, helped merchants hang and display their wares, and prod errant books back into formation. Carry them with honor and grace.\n\nSWORDS\nSwords are excellent, imposing weapons that carry statements of the swift justice of the Grasp and the steadfast rules of the Stricture. Mortal merchants fear the fate a sword brings and can be corralled into behaving. Keep the blade golden and brightly polished. So that all who see it know it as a sword of a Guardian.

Where spirits stay late\nIn the shining night's slate\nAnd coals glow to light the brave.\nRed footprints lead straight,\nthrough a tavern's doorway.\nA chorus here sings of Fargrave!\n \nWhere giant's bones rest far from the Ashpit,\nAnd the roads outside are dark and unlit,\nIt's the greatest of cities discovered by clan,\nReaching it may take an entire life's span. \nStill, all are welcome in Fargrave!\n \nSome think it's Apocrypha, they are quite wrong.\nThis city of cities we immortalize in song.\nWith profits for all and mercy for none \nProsperity's work will never be done.\nThe bazaars never close in Fargrave!\n \nWhere spirits stay late\nIn the shining night's slate\nAnd coals glow to light the brave.\nRed footprints lead straight,\nthrough a tavern's doorway.\nA chorus here sings of Fargrave!\n \nMore vibrant than Meridia's Colored Rooms,\nAnd with all the Daedra, there's very few tombs.\nOur trade and our commerce fill every last street,\nYou'll remember every stranger and friend you meet,\nWhen you cross the threshold of Fargrave! \n \nThe stars of the Void shine far away,\nWhile Daedric merchants haggle by day.\nThe Plaza of Portals leads everywhere,\nAnd the Bearer's Rest has drinks to spare.\nThere's always a party in Fargrave!
By Dylamar for the Fargrave Mortal Inclusion and Visitation Program.\n\nMost mortals make their homes in the Shambles, despite the area's reputation for lawlessness and danger. In fact, it may be that very lawlessness that attracts so many mortals and Daedra alike to its warrens. The district offers a unique blend of neighborhoods, eclectic shops, and artisanal goods. The neighborhoods feature a blend of mortal settlers and Daedra who prefer to distance themselves from the strict rules of conduct prevalent in Fargrave's more prominent districts. \n\nENTRY WAYS\nThe Shambles exists beyond the walls that border Fargrave's more upscale districts. The doors that lead to the Shambles are mostly hidden or nondescript. While the gates of Fargrave appear grandiose and elaborate, most entrances to the streets of the Shambles do not stand out in the least. Finding a door to the Shambles can be as much accident and luck as planned excursion, and many wanderers sometimes step through to find themselves lost in the Shamble's labyrinthine alleys.\n\nMARKETS\nUnlike the stalls of the Bazaar, the markets of the Shambles tend to move from location to location like a leaf in the wind. Somehow, though, a merchant's best customers always seem to know how to find them. Rumors of a complex system of obscure marks in the street tell those in the know where to find a particular merchant or a specific type of goods. Such information, unfortunately, is against the Stricture and beyond the scope of this guide. Suffice it to say, there are certain goods and services only available within the Shambles, so anyone seeking them would do well to make the trip.\n\nFARE AND SUSTENANCE\nOne of the great joys of the Shambles is a little-known café, Brixit's. The food there is incredible, with buttery pastries, crisp fruits, and drinks hot enough to form molten puddles in the street outside. Stop by and try some boiled leaf mixtures and be sure to say that the recommendation came from Dylamar. If you seek something stronger, the Wishbone might be right up your alley. This tavern has a rough and tumble charm and serves the best frozen effluvium this side of the Evergloam.\n\nLOCAL FLAVOR\nEnjoy a thrilling conversation with Netelyas, the purveyor of all goods a mortal could require. His legendary repartee and friendly demeanor make shopping at his stall a genuine pleasure—even for Dremora. If you're not opposed to felines, I'm sure Netelyas's cat, Malfeasance, would appreciate some extra attention, too. \n\nSAFETY\nAs previously mentioned, there are Daedra in Fargrave proper who may behave violently toward any mortal that provokes their ire. Luckily, there are laws and ordinances that no Daedra can break while within the city walls. The Stricture and the Grasp who enforce it extends to the Shambles, but this is not a guarantee of safety. A number of less than friendly groups control portions of the Shambles, and their territory should be avoided if at all possible. \n\nThe Errants, led by Boss Kezo, are a group of mortals who do not have the comfort of a pact to keep them sane in the climate of Fargrave. This makes the Errants fiercely protective of their territory and prone to acts of violence. They claim to protect the mortal residents of the Shambles, especially those who occupy the western warrens, but this author sees it more like a protection racket. Watch out for these troublemakers.\n\nSkein Row, a collection of streets on the east side, serves as the lair of Shaemeta and her fellow Spiderkith. These Daedra are not friendly, especially not to mortals, who they seem to consider a food source. You can identify Skein Row by the vast amount of webbing that stretches between the buildings. If you encounter large webs, turn around and walk the other way. \n\nThe Vanquished control a swath of the Shambles around the central plazas. Enzir and her fellow Dremora enjoy hunting mortals, so consider that area off limits until further notice. \n\nDespite all of these dangers, the Shambles is a wonderful place to visit and a great place to live. As with all new cities, I advise that you exercise caution on your first few days in the district, but as soon as the warning signs become familiar, the district will feel as welcoming to you as it does to me.
Knight Richel,\n\nTomorrow morning a wagon escorted by two Society of the Steadfast retainers will travel to Steadfast Manor from the docks at Castle Navire. Take your knights and set up an ambush along the road. You are to kill the two retainers—a man named Grenier and a woman named Danise. They have seen things they should not have seen and must be eliminated.\n\nConfiscate the wagon's load for use by the Order. Any other spoils are yours to keep. But remember, the retainers are your mission. Not the supplies.\n\nThere are several good spots to conceal your knights between Castle Navire and Steadfast Manor. I'm sure you will pick a suitable site.\n\nThe Ascendant Magus
By Fleet Provisioner Sorticthel\n\nWelcome to the fleet, captain. First things first, take everything you think about running a crew and toss it in the drink. You pledge your ship to the Dreadsail fleet, you run your rigging as the Fleet Queen says. \n\nDon't like it? Better you turn and sail straight back to Pyandonea right now, before you wind up dredged through the reef until you've sprinkled every last scrap of your flesh for the barnacles to suck up. If that's all clear, then quarter your crew and start outfitting them like proper Dreadsails.\n\nCHESTS\nLight ornaug leather vests and chest wraps are most of what you're going to find available. You'll be expected to outswim a shark and scale a ship's hull in anything you wear, so don't claim any steel you haven't got the gills for.
By the Ascendant Champion\nA guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Ascendant Order style\n\nWelcome to the cause, recruit! Not so long ago I was a new aspirant in the Order, just like you. With devotion and hard work, I advanced through the ranks of knight, guardian, and banneret until the Ascendant Lord himself selected me to serve as the Order's chosen champion. Let my example inspire you to embrace your duties with similar zeal.\n\nWhile we must hide our faces as we go about the Order's work, it is important that our arms and our uniforms declare our allegiance for all to see. We are no rabble, no mere bandits! We are the knights who rise from the shadows, challenging those who mistreat and misrule us. Wear your hood and helm with pride, recruit. You share a bond of fraternity with all who bear them.\n\nThis is what the Order requires of our arms and armor.\n\nAXES\nIn close battle all parts of a weapon may come into play. The blade of an Ascendant Order axe features a strong forward point for thrusting, as well as a sturdy steel haft for blocking enemy blows. The blade's hook can also be used to dismount riders.\n\nBELTS\nA wide, sturdy belt made from reinforced leather guards an Ascendant soldier's waist and supports weapons and armor worn on the lower body. For heavy armor, a hinged plate adds protection for the knight's groin.\n\nBOOTS\nSpeed and stealth are just as important as protection for an Ascendant Order knight. Soft leather reinforced by steel plate at the knee and ankle provides good mobility and a quieter footfall than sabatons with more extensive coverage. The heavy armor adds a shin-guard of steel sandwiched between layers of dark leather.\n \nBOWS\nEvery land seems to have its own preferred material and pattern for a bow, but one of the advantages of recruiting from all over Tamriel is the ability to take the best each offers. An Ascendant Order bow is a compound weapon made from sturdy rosewood or yew, powerful enough to pierce heavy plate at close range.\n\nCHESTS\nMuch of the Ascendant Order's work requires stealth and subterfuge. Dark leather helps a knight to remain concealed until the moment they strike, and to vanish again when their work is done. Even the breastplate of heavy armor is typically covered by soft leather to muffle sounds and hide the telltale gleam of steel.\n\nDAGGERS\nRelatively narrow for its length, an Ascendant Order dagger is designed for the thrust, not the slash. Its thin blade easily pierces mail, but it is strong enough to resist bending or breaking. The crossguard can also be used to catch or disarm an enemy's blade.\n\nGLOVES\nThe arms and hands of an Ascendant Order soldier are protected by vambraces of boiled leather (for lighter suits) or steel (for heavier armor). Sturdy leather gloves cover the wearer's fingers. Flexibility and ease of wear help our knights to conceal their armor when needed.\n\nHELMETS\nAs the Ascendant Lord likes to say, "Anonymity is our sword and our shield." Knights of the Order hide their faces because they belong to all races and all lands. Even the lightest armor features a mask and hood to conceal the wearer's identity.\n\nLEG GREAVES\nAn Ascendant Order knight may be called upon to slip unnoticed through a crowd, scramble over rooftops, or outrun enemies in heavier armor. The best pattern for our greaves is a light, close-fitting plate of stiffened leather or steel that provides the best protection possible without sacrificing speed.\n\nMACES\nThe Ascendant Order often confronts well-armored enemies, and nothing is better for crushing armor than a good heavy mace. Even a knight in plate can be disabled by a mace-blow to the leg or knocked senseless by a strike to the helm. A strong steel haft balances the weapon's weight and ensures it won't break in battle.\n\nSHIELDS\nMade from overlapping plates of light, strong steel, the Ascendant Order shield is a sturdy heater distinguished by its engrailed upper edge and nicked sides. A skilled fighter can easily catch an enemy's blade with these seemingly decorative elements. Naturally, the shield proudly displays our crown-and-gauntlet emblem.\n\nSHOULDERS\nAn Ascendant Order warrior typically wears close-fitting, rounded spaulders to protect the shoulders and upper arms. These pieces have few embellishments and fit snugly, so that the wearer can easily don or remove a cloak in order to disappear into a crowd. They are also less likely to snag in brush or foliage.\n\nSTAVES\nSome knights fight with sword and shield; others fight with spell and staff. The Ascendant Order welcomes all who are ready to fight against tyranny. An Ascendant Order staff is a strong rod of steel with a dark leather grip. The weapon's head is heavy enough to deal a deadly blow in melee, if a battle comes to that.\n\nSWORDS\nFew swords can defeat plate armor with the edge alone, so the Ascendant Order favors a narrow blade with a sturdy cross-section suitable for thrusting as well as slashing. Punching the point through a joint or visor is more effective than trying to club down a well-armored adversary with the edge. Strong quillons help to protect the wielder's hands in the thick of the fight.
The world provides clues for any challenge. If you have the wits.\n\nYou have overcome this challenge.\n\nRemember the pertinent word: \n\nUnderstanding.
By Boss Kezo\n\nLook, that so-called Visitor's Guide to the Shambles is a load of horker dung! Dylamar wouldn't know the western warrens from Skein Row if he blundered into one of Shaermeta's webs and got served up as a banquet to her pet spiders! The entire purpose of that pamphlet is to entice mortals to leave the prominent districts to better appease their Daedric overlords. Let me give you the real story about the Shambles.\n\nFirst, forget about those Skein Row spider demons and Enzir's blood-crazed Dremora. Shaermeta and her Invisible Web can keep the east side! It's full of spiders now, anyway! Enzir's Vanquished, on the other hand, have no sense of loyalty. They abandoned whatever Prince they once served, right? So how long before they turn on each other? Any cycle now is my guess. And when that happens, the Shambles will totally fall under the Errants' control. Except for Skein Row. I hate spiders.\n\nHere's how the pamphlet should actually read:\n\nENTRY WAYS\nYou can find doors that lead into the Shambles throughout the northern sections of Fargrave proper, including a major entrance in the Fargrave Crafting Plaza. Remember to carry a full coin purse with you. My gang is less likely to inflict lethal damage upon you if you make a substantial offer of gold or some other valuable currency. We're not too picky.\n\nMARKETS\nThe markets located throughout the western warrens are the best markets in the Shambles—and I'm not just saying that because we get a cut of all of their business. We do, but I really do think they're the best. \n\nFARE AND SUSTENANCE\nMy brewmaster, Jik, makes a tasty bone-shavings ale, but don't even think about it. She can barely make enough to soothe the Errants' parched throats. And the Argonian, Bowl-Stirrer, really knows how to roast a clannfear! Again, no roast for you. If you really want something to eat or drink in the Shambles, the guide does make one good suggestion. The Wishbone is a proper tavern. And there's always someone willing to start a brawl if the place gets too quiet.\n\nLOCAL FLAVOR\nWhat does this even mean? And Netelyas? He's a cheat who never hands over everything he owes. I need to remember to take care of that. Next time.\n\nSAFETY\nThis is the Shambles. There is no safety. If you can't protect yourself, then let us do it for you. Our rates are reasonable, and my gang rarely gets too carried away when they hand out a beating. And forget about the Grasp. Their reach doesn't extend to the Shambles. Why should it? We're mostly all mortals out here, and the Stricture doesn't care about mortals.\n\nSo, if you come to the Shambles, come with your eyes open and your pockets full. You might leave with them a little lighter, but there really are some nice things to do and see out here.
By Matthias Vervins\n\nFrog-metal, or Syrabane's Steel, is a highly coveted rarity to those of us alive today. But this was not always the case. The famed buoyant metal is an astounding prize for mariners around Amenos. The supply is woefully limited and not exactly something one can just whip up. So, I will describe these designs how they were, before Syrabane's metal was lost to the sea. When stalwart sea knights made use of these weapons and armor, they did so unafraid of the waves that rocked the decks beneath their feet. These knights of the unfathomable depths are worthy of study, as are their arms.\n\nI located this record of one such knight who took the time to painstakingly describe the sheer magnificence of his equipment. I hope you enjoy his account as much as I, dear reader.\n\nBOWS\nDo we truly wield bows? Or do we carry serpents of the sea along our backs, with their spines curved as they crest the waves with their spiked fins? No one can be certain. Our weapons certainly resemble terrifying leviathans with their sinuous frames and sharp, cutting fins. But we do not sacrifice effectiveness for style.

I hope you enjoy his account as much as I, dear reader.\n\nCHESTS\nWhile our armor varies greatly within our ranks, our chest pieces usually have two things in common. One, they are easy to move around in and two, that they provide excellent protection. The leather we use for the parts closest to the wearer's body is specially treated so that it does not suffer from long-term exposure to saltwater and the elements.
By Lord Bacaro Volorus\nA guide to crafting armor and weapons in the Society of the Steadfast style\n\nI congratulate you, my friends, and welcome you to the Society of the Steadfast. You have committed yourselves to the noblest struggle of our time. Many warriors have taken up arms to fight for great causes—sometimes glorious, sometimes cruel or selfish. But in the ranks of the Steadfast, you now fight for peace. When the wars troubling Tamriel finally end, you can take pride in the knowledge that no one fought for a nobler cause than you did.\n\nIt is my earnest hope that the battles we fight can be won with our swords in their sheaths. Sadly, this is not always possible. We Steadfast often must place ourselves in harm's way to succor the victims of war. And so, my brothers and sisters, we must gird ourselves for battles we do not wish to fight, and take up arms to protect those who cannot protect themselves. But even though we must be ready for strife, let no one mistake us for their enemies!\n\nSHOULDERS\nAll Steadfast are soldiers in the cause of peace. Even Steadfast in the robes of mages wear pauldrons of dyed leather in token of their dedication. Naturally, Steadfast in heavier armor add articulated steel plates beneath the dyed leather to withstand enemy blows when forced to fight.
By Zoellene Ruqueville, Scholar and Former Guard\n\nIn my youth, I patrolled Gonfalon Bay, ensuring that all remained safe. During that time, I grew to appreciate the quality and utility of the gear provided by the watch, designed by old man Canis. Cussed, hungry, and mean … but my fellow street soldiers were never left wanting. \n\nAs he always said. "Looking impressive is a secondary concern, beef-wit. But it can be useful."\n\nSHIELDS\n\nYou can't miss the seahawk on a Systres guardian's shield—unless you're trying to tag that guard with an arrow. In that case, the shield serves its purpose well by deflecting not only arrows, but also other martial attacks—when used properly.\n\nFlip it over and it acts as a decent dicing receptacle, too. Not that we ever did such a thing.
My dear Kiv, \n\nI cannot wait to see you again. As I promised when last we met, I have found a necklace fit for you. A rather elegant ruby. Red is very much your color, I feel. To cement our bond. I wear the gold pendant you gave me every day, close to my heart. I know you worried that it was, as you said, a simple piece. But I treasure it more than all the other expensive baubles I own. \n\nIf I am not at home when you return to Wayrest, check the market. Or, of course, the Temple of the Divines.\n\nI meant what I said. The difference in our wealth matters not to me. I see you working hard, traveling, striving! And now you tell me you will be working as an agent for a well-known trading company from the Systres Archipelago? I know that you are a good man. I did not know how much I needed someone like you in my life. Since that fateful day our paths crossed at the temple in Wayrest, I have prayed to the Eight every night. Mara touched me, touched us, that day.\n\nWe have much to talk about and so much to plan for. I am sending this to the inn at Seyda Neen, as you said it was the best way to reach you. I know your pride keeps telling you to keep working, and I understand that. But I think I can, at least, make your working a bit smoother, and perhaps even more profitable. With your new connections and my various business concerns, we will be able to accomplish much together.\n\nI look forward to learning more about your Living Gods. This notion of Almsivi has always intrigued me. I have been reading about them and have many questions!\n\nMissing you terribly, \nYour Julles Laurdon
There is sand in my shoe. And in my heart. \n\nAurelia and I are apart,\nI went to tell her of my love, \nfull of hope and wine.\n\nI threw up in the corner,\nAnd pretended it was not mine.\nShe was kind.\nThen she was gone. \n\nI contemplate the sea for a year and a day.\n(something about sunrises?)
The most expensive and beloved meals on High Isle, as complied by culinary scholar Bellona Calatorius. \n\nROASTED SPARKLING ANGLERMOUTH ON A BED OF KELP\nSeasoned and sauteed to perfection, this flaky and flavorful fish is served with a latticework of decadent blanched kelp to provide texture and add a hint of brightness to the dish. Chefs spend months learning to balance what could be an overwhelming citrus note in the kelp, but when prepared correctly, this dish never disappoints. \n\nABECEAN HALIBUT SOUP\nThe halibut's flavor pares well with the soup's aromatics and body. The soup's vegetable matter perfectly complements the fish. The combination turns a simple soup into the highlight of the banquet. \n\nSMOKED ALBATROSS EGG WITH CAVIAR\nTypically served when the seas turn stormy, this dish is more robust than many of the delicacies typically available on High Isle. The enormous eggs are smoked for two days, infusing the yolk with the pungent flavor of island applewood. Proponents of the dish claim that the bursts of caviar elevate the personality of the egg, adding an element of the sea as befits all High Isle fare.\n\nSEA SALT TEA\nTypically used as a palate cleanser between meals, this tea uses a combination of island leaves and sea salt. It is served warm in delicate glassware that shows off its beautifully clear quality.\n\nHONEY CAKES WITH CLOTTED CREAM AND PEARLED WHITE CHOCOLATE\nA sweet treat which is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the mouth, this dessert caused an entire banquet hall to break into applause when it was introduced by the court chef in 2E 455. The cakes practically drip with clover honey and clotted cream, and white chocolate spheres sprinkled over the top round off the cake's sweet flavor. Some chefs add fresh berries or a sharp compote, but many play to the dessert's white and frothy appearance and add meringues or a lightly flavored custard.
Well, Molynire is dead. His end was especially grotesque. First, sliced in twain, then diced by those energy beams that emit from the walls. The buffoon thought himself nimble enough to avoid them. Didn't even make it past the first set before he tripped on a loose rock. \n\nThe Dwarves' sense of security surpasses practicality and moves into the realm of cruel humor. Imagine the mind that invents such devices. Highly focused magical energy like these beams could be used for so much good. Instead, the creator hid them here on this godsforsaken island. Whatever they protect can't be worth it.\n\nReader, have you heard the voice yet? Calling from deep within the bowels of this station, mocking us as we head deeper within? Each word sends cold spike into my mind. What is this place? Mara protect me.\n\nTaludilwen insists that we press on. Why just sit here to die, she argues. Fair enough. I don't have enough curiosity to learn more, but also don't wish to have an undead ghoul chew on my guts. I suppose I'll follow her.\n\nAt this point, I'm writing to calm myself. It's no longer about warning future survivors. It's about keeping my sanity.
By "Growler" Silaine, Marine Salvager \nThere's a bounty of salvage in the Graven Deep! Divines willing, it can be ours! If we're to make it out of this wrecking expedition alive, we'll need to be able to protect our ships and our spoils. Or become the wrecked ourselves! Let old Growler's knowledge be put to page, and we'll see if we can make proper mariners out of you filching wreckers yet!\n\nBOWS\nAn oft-forgotten weapon at sea, on account of the skill needed to account for the wind and waves. Mariner's bows are crafted with springy driftwood, if you can find it, and are adorned with cloth or feathers above the grip to give an eye for the direction of the wind.

Maintain our control through whatever means you deem necessary.\n\nThe Ascendant Lord
These words appear to be incomprehensible…
I've only been in the area a short while but already find both Skyrim and the Reach almost unrecognizable. In all my years of opposition to the blight, I have never seen vampiric corruption on this scale. I will record my observations here so that they may be useful later on. For myself or whomever must continue the fight should I perish.\n\nDay 1 \nThe search for my prey has begun. The dark power of the Harrowstorms no doubt drew him to this area. I must be vigilant, as it feels as though the blood-starved lurk behind every rock and copse of trees. Despite the danger, I will not allow him to escape. I owe them that much.\n\nDay 4\nI had, at first, thought the adoption of the name the Gray Host merely vanity. Surely, I thought, this blood swarm could not live up to the feared reputation of Verkarth's horde. I was wrong. If anything, these beings outmatch the fury of the past. I am forced to adapt my tactics somewhat to avoid being overwhelmed. I am not afraid. In fact, I welcome it. The hunter, when hunted by his prey, is reminded of the taste of fear. It sharpens the edge. Heightens the senses. \n\nDay 7\nMy work has been arduous. Every night is restless, haunted by nightmares both real and imagined. I hunt when I can, sleep when I must. This hunt has become a campaign. And I must bear up under the weight of this responsibility.\n\nDay 12\nMore new tactics, new cruelties from the Host. I tracked a refugee group I was convinced were fledglings come to join the throng. They happened upon a young girl, weeping beside the road. I readied my blade and charged ahead, expecting to save the youth. Only to stop dead in my tracks as a group of ashen-faced children materialized from the shadows. The orphan girl and her friends tore the group apart, then turned their red eyes upon me. I did what I had to.\n\nDay 15\nI think exhaustion is catching up to me. Either I encountered the fastest gargoyle in Tamriel or I am slowing down. I suspect I know which. My healing skills should suffice. But if I was even a moment slower, I would be writing this with but a single hand. Despite my reservations, I have sent out a summons for aid. I must put aside my pride in the interest of concluding the hunt. It seems I will need a partner for what is to come.
Three seeds I saw upon one tree\nOf rowan, ash, and oak.\nWith care I set them in the dust\nTo guide and teach our folk.\n\nThree trees, nine limbs, five hundred leaves\nOne season for each root.\nLet each seed sleep in slumber deep\nAnd then the throne renew.\n\nWhen mountain shakes and Sower wakes\nThe throne shall bloom again.\nOne choice, one will, one binding word\nShall bless or scourge all lands.
(Due to water damage, many of the entries in this journal are barely legible.)\n\nIf Mirah had coin for every time a smoothskin had a map and a dream, she'd never have to charter her ship to fools for scraps again. Today, a treasure sniffer by the name of Gallus begged every sailor he could to take him out into Thrassian waters. Poor fool doesn't realize what a superstitious bunch sailors can be.\n\n* * *\nThat Gallus came back around the docks today. Mirah snuck a quick peek at his map. Maybe he's onto something after all.\n\n* * *\nGallus says that Mirah's eyes frighten him. That they shine like a beast's when the lantern goes out. This one does not think that is a bad thing. Mirah has learned that fear is a powerful tool when dealing with treasure-seeking smoothskins. Besides, it wasn't this one's idea to sail at night, lanterns dark. Gallus insisted on it, even now as he squints at his map. A dull-clawed fool with barely a hair on his face. Jone and Jode guide us!\n\n* * *\nWe've come to the edge of a dead coral reef. Gallus seems excited, but all this one sees is a week wasted in dangerous waters. However, Gallus has proven to be a gifted swimmer with some apparent knowledge of water-breathing magics. He spent most of the day diving and pulling up bits of stone and debris. He promised me riches and insists that we're close, but Mirah has her doubts.\n\n* * *\nSomething strange happened today. While fishing, this one thought she saw Gallus come up for air near her hook. Mirah was ready to scold him for scaring away dinner. Even had one of his rocks in hand to throw at him. But it wasn't Gallus. This one blinked and, where Mirah thought she had seen the face of the treasure-seeker, she saw only dead coral, pale white and dull in the afternoon sun.\n\n* * *\nThree days of diving and finally Gallus has something to show for it. A sack full of gold stamped with the Alessian Empire's symbol. Damned smoothskin found the wreck of an All Flags Navy ship. Mirah's mouth waters at the thought of what else might be down there.\n\n* * *\nIt's sundown and Gallus has yet to surface for air. Even with what little magic he possessed, Mirah knows he can't have lasted this long under water. Mirah's stomach churns at the thought. No use in sailing away now. Sun is too low and even the breeze has deserted us. If Gallus hasn't returned by morning, this one will sail back to Vastyr.\n\n* * *\nKnocking on the hull? This one is not imagining the sound. Something is banging on the outside of the ship, below the water line. Dawn can't come soon enough.\n\n* * *\nThis one saw him. Gallus. Even with the wind behind us and the reef far back, Mirah's claws shake while she writes this. He was twisted. Transformed into a misshapen husk. Curse that map. Curse those waters. May Khenarthi guide Gallus to Llesw'er.\n\n* * *\nKnocking. Mirah still hears the knocking.
By Varona Vedralu, Senior Lecturer, University of Gwylim\n\nSettlements have sat on the southernmost shore of Galen since the time of Druid King Kasorayn. Excavation beneath the crowded cobblestones of the modern city of Vastyr have revealed examples of druid tunnels and ancient hovels, Draoife ritual sites, Sinestral war camps, Sword-Singer performance rings, and even the tell-tale signs of Sload slime-warrens. \n \nThe city as we know it today is a much more recent addition to the jeweled shores of the archipelago's northernmost island. While Gonfalon Bay gets much (deserved!) credit as the heart of Baron-Admiral Olo's ship-building endeavors, the great dense forests of Galen were far too tempting a prize for the shipbuilders of the All-Flags Navy to ignore.\n\nCenturies of rule from the mainland left High Isle with the traditional copse-and-commoner system from the north shore to Gonfalon Bay. Galen, by contrast, was practically an untouched wilderness, as the druid circles had spent centuries maintaining its sanctity. Around 1E 2240, Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo and his staff ramped up their shipbuilding efforts. Readying for an assault on Thras, they knew that the verdant wilds of Galen—and the druids themselves—would be critical to the success of the fleet. Resources were coming from every port on the mainland, but an untapped resource like Galen couldn't be ignored.\n\nFrom the memoirs of Captain Forvse Nelvilo: "The admiral's boots were as mired in mud as the rest of us as we rode the surf in the tenders. We'd sent ahead envoys to the druid council, but the beach was empty as he strode onto the sand. He glanced back and I saw a confident grin in the light of our torches. He turned, stood, and waited. And waited. I thought we'd be there all night, when suddenly bonfires at either end of the beach ignited, and there they were. All three circles, hundreds of druids. Their leaders came out to parley, but I already knew Old Olo had won them over."\n\nFrom those early days as a deepwater port and shipbuilding harbor for the All-Flags Navy, Vastyr was a blending of Breton and druidic culture. The city has always featured a set of standing stones as well as a space to worship the Divines, and a nuanced discussion of the True Way was just as common in its dockside taverns as noble gossip or bardic verse.\n\nIt truly came into its own early in the Second Era as the fortunes of House Mornard began to climb. Backbiting, bribery, and brutality earned Phane Mornard the spot of regional governor of the Systres Archipelago. While the family's main concerns were the manor house on High Isle or the mining operations on Amenos, many within the house felt a strong connection to druidic culture thanks to Phane's grandmother Dorona. \n\nShe was said to have deep ties to the Wyrd and the Green, and insisted the family invest in Vastyr for the good of the druids as well as for the familial line.\n\nMornard coin proved invaluable a few hundred years later in the wake of the Gathering Storm's siege of the city. The fall of the Empire created chaos across Tamriel. The Systreans had to weather a storm just as bad as the Tamsfolk, as would-be rulers and pretender kings assaulted the archipelago no less than six times in a hundred year span. The sacking of Vastyr in 2E 365 was one of the most violent moments in the island's history, seeing half the city destroyed and most of its citizens scattered to the wilderness.\n\nWhile the later actions of Duke Ruffe Mornard would speak to a despotic manner, his ancestor was revered as the rebuilder and patron of a new Vastyr. Bernique was known as the "mother of the city" for decades after the siege, as coin and comforts from across Mornard holdings allowed the city to rebuild and refine their place in the world. The towering walls at either end of Vastyr Bay are remnants of this era, as is the expansive manor that now dominates the city's skyline.\n\nAfter the twin disasters of the Knahaten Flu and Ranser's War, House Mornard withdrew to Vastyr to lick its wounds and plan for the future. The modern city serves as a melting pot of High Isle, druidic, and mainland culture. Ideas from across the world flow through its gates, as druid crafts sail beyond its walls to patrons across the continent. \n\nVastyr has ever been a handhold of "civilized" culture on the edge of the Galen wilds. A city of many worlds, many cultures, and much promise.
Heave ho, heave ho\nTil we see the shore,\nFrom night to morn\nWith our nets all worn.\n\nOnce we spot our prey\nIt won't last the day,\nIt can't escape our sight\nAnd soon we'll get a bite.\n\nThen the contest begins\nAs our vessel rocks and spins,\nWith hook and net and spear\nWe reel our quarry near.\n\nHeave ho, heave ho\nTil we see the shore,\nFrom night to morn\nWe fish and blare our horn.\n\nAt the dock we love the stares\nAs the crowd admires our wares,\nA catch so big\nThey'll dance a jig.\n\nThen we finish the day\nAnd we dance and play,\nWith mead so sweet\nAs we put up our feet.\n\nHeave ho, heave ho\nTil we set out once more,\nWe live as we please\nAnd we hit the high seas.\nSetting sail with a song and a joke\nThat's the life of a Vastyr fisherfolk!

In the fort, just around the way.
Crown in hand, leave and look right.
Deep in the den of debauchery.
Search every nook to lift the Vale.
In a smoldering shell.
Camped on the way to Claw's Strike.
Shedding shame in the oasis.
Stored on a Bergama roof.
Near a paid feather-finder.
Monumental find in the Lost City.
Among the vessel's burnt cousins.
Search near the cliffs … cliffs … cliffs ….
Within sight of Mnem.
Where archers of the Eight train.
Where fishmongers sell no fish.
From the river to the grave.
In a stump on the northern shore of Lake Amaya.
Overlooking the Oleander Coast Winery
Along the sun's path toward dusk
Within the Teeth of Sithis atop the sunrise xanmeer
In the ruins where poachers Prowl.
At the mouth of a cave, in an ignoble abode.

I failed Stormhaven. I failed everyone.
Your help with both these matters is much appreciated. Until that damn guillotine's been dismantled, I won't be able to sleep. \n\nAnd more importantly, until the matter in Rivenspire is resolved, the Covenant will be severely weakened.
Now that you've put the sleep potion in the kegs, we can bargain for Miranda's release. \n\nBut let's find out where she is. Search the counting house for clues to where they're keeping her.
Lead on. I'll follow.
Why did you make him leave? I was this close to reaching the peace of death!\n\nIt has just been a jest—the Daggerfall Covenant, my kingdom, my life. I was never worthy to be king. I'll die here and one more worthy will take my place.
The Covenant thanks you for joining the war effort! With talented crafters like yourself at our back, there's no challenge we can't overcome.\n\nAkatosh bless your wares, friend.
Oh, my aching neck .… I haven't been this sore in years, but freedom sure does feel good.\n\nThis situation was more dangerous than I realized. You went way beyond the call of duty here, friend.\n\nI can't adequately express my gratitude.
So wait a minute. You mean the constable was actually working with the slavers?\n\nI'm confused.
If they hadn't snuck up behind me, they wouldn't have had a chance.
The General let you leave? I thought we'd be carrying you out in pieces.\n\nI am glad you have earned his respect though. You are a strong warrior and always welcome at my campfire.
I hear you might be leaving. But you're coming back, right? An arena without a champion draws no crowds.
Sorry, hunter. No more bounties today.
Go to Aldcroft, he says. It'll be safer, he says. I shouldn't have listened to LeBlanc.
The Fighters Guild is recruiting if you're interested in joining. You look like you can handle yourself in a fight. We need people like that.
Look at this! You walk in like you own the place, like you fear absolutely nothing.\n\nIf it's a fight you want, though, you've come to the wrong place. This is a place of business. I'm a businessman.
It is finished. The earth's strength shall return now.
I don't want to leave the prince alone for long. We'll have to be quick.
That … that was the thing that attacked my father!
What in Oblivion is he thinking? How dare this petty priest question me—the chosen of Arkay? It's obviously because I've earned the god's favor and he hasn't. He's jealous!
When you're done, find <<1>> in the center of town. He'll want to know the fracas has finally started.\n\nI'll let Marent know you're coming.
When the snakes attacked, it was complete chaos. The horses ran away with the wagons … and I ran too.\n\nI know some of the people were bitten. I only hope we are not too late with the antidote.
You've acquitted yourself honorably.
<<1>> reminds me of some of our holds in the Rift. This place is much grander, of course. But just like here, there's always some milk-drinker trying to break down our walls.
Unless the Duke himself tells me to make an exception, the library is off-limits.
We'll make sure these people receive care.\n\nWhen you have a moment, return to Narsis and speak to Naryu. She has a lead on the name you uncovered. I'll join you as soon as I can.
I'll gather the guards and we'll meet you there.\n\nGood luck, my friend.
The mercenaries only make things worse with the Dark Elves. Better if Stormhold is one happy family.\n\nAnd if you plan to start a family, might I suggest a vial of powdered kagouti horn for heightened potency? No? Your loss.
Got a prime mess here to clean up.\n\nAt least those mechanicals are staying inside the ruin.
Come aboard my boat. I will take you across the swamp waters.
It's heartening to see people willing to fight for us. I think the Shadowscales are heroes.
I'm a bit more at peace, now that I have Risa's amulet. I feel like I can sense her presence sometimes. Like she's watching over me.
<<1>> is waiting for you inside the ruins. Hurry.
Please, leave me to my grief.
You know what I'd think if someone asked me where we should look for reinforcements? Summoning the spirits of past Ordinators would have been far down my list.\n\nAnd how does a spirit hold a sword? Are their swords ghostly too?
Activate the wards while I find Tanval.
Return with the stone or die. It's really up to you, mortal.
You're not with the tribe, are you? Help me!
Being dead, I have a certain immunity to Balreth's power. \n\nI'm keenly interested to see what happens in the next few minutes.
I knew you were game.
Remember, friend. Kaasha has provided. Perhaps you will not forget her.
We'll banish the last few Daedra once we've had time to catch our breath.
They didn't expect to see a Dunmer, so I made sure they didn't. I can be stealthy at need.
Surii finally sent help? The Goblins went crazy and started killing without warning. I barely escaped!
Go away, before I call a guard to deal with you.
I've nothing left, so these will help a lot. After I've mourned my husband, I'll sell them and use the money to leave this place. It holds too many bad memories.
We can take care of ourselves from here. May you swim freely down the river of life.
I wouldn't have thought those milk drinkers would leave their cozy taverns to come down here.\n\nI'll have to get this wound seen to, then. I'm going to need my sword arm!
I don't understand why he'd trick us. We followed him here, like lambs to the slaughter.
<<<1>> bounces back and forth under your hand. He looks like he wants you to follow.>
Greetings, friend. What can I do for you?
Ain't leaving our pigs. No chance. Them damned Daggers would carve them up for bacon.
The people of Lower Yorgrim will soon come around to my way of thinking. After all, we are what we eat!
What can I do for you?
End the witch. For all of us.\n\nDon't worry about me. I'll be fine. This tree's doing a great job of holding me up.
We must press on. We'll burn these foul eggs after you clear out the spiders.
Good luck freeing our soldiers. I'll meet you and the soldiers at the barracks when you're finished.
You! You saved King Jorunn! You certainly know how to make an impression!
You have to get past the Worm Cult. Spinner Indinael needs help!
Someone found help. I feared it would soon be too late.
<The giant stares at you expectantly.>
Save our soldiers, please. We must stop all this senseless death.
The Hound came, seeking solace for his broken heart. The others turned him away when they heard what he wanted. A memory. A chance.\n\nI couldn't. His tale tore at me, and I wove a bit of him into the story. But soon, he became the story.
Here is where the Green Lady practiced archery. She practiced with her friend Unthor and her cousin Borodor, but she outstripped them from the very first day. It was then that her aunt, the Green Lady Finoriell, began to take notice of her potential.
The altars are cleansed! My brothers and sisters will rest again!
Speak with Jadvar, inside the cave. But don't get your hopes up.\n\nIf the Three Old Gods require your help, that's between you, them, and the Ternion elders.
Majorn waits for you in the nearby manor. He'll be pleased by your willingness to engage in a proper conversation.
You do a great service for Rigurt. Rigurt knew he could count on you!
Oh! Good to see you. I have sad news: Golun is dead. We heard the sounds of a struggle. My soldiers and I arrived too late.
We're in your debt. If you ever have need of blades, come speak to me. I guess I should find some more flowery, Thane-like speech, but that's not how grandfather raised me. Speak plain and honest, he said.
She's waiting for you at the Riften Guildhall in The Rift. Good luck, comrade.
The Reach are here too. I need to see what they're doing. These aren't the same as the ones in Shor's Stone, so who knows what horrors await?
The Maormer will interrogate the crew, and their methods are very unpleasant!
I'll get these to the Artificer. I'm certain he'll know what to do. The dead of Ezduiin will finally know rest.
Telenger didn't say anything, but I can tell. He's disappointed. I'm going to spend the entire trip home asking the Stars how to get back into his good graces.
You've saved us again! We'll never repay you at this rate.
Be sure to speak with King Jorunn before you leave. He's been asking for you.
Did you get them all?
Let me see. Yes! That's it! This one has made a very tidy profit.\n\nHold on a moment while No-Nose retreives his shiny, shiny coins. This one has so many coins now. So many! So shiny!
Sure is quiet around here. I wonder what stopped the plague?
I need a full report from Centurion Aldrin for the High Thane before I leave. You, however, should get moving.
This stuff stinks. But hey, I guess it beats being sick!
The Site is cursed! I see no profit here, only blood.
Good work! We'll make it through this, I know it.
Thank you for bringing the news, unhappy as it was. Good day to you.
Did you find anything?
So the Maormer are really here. Anala was right. I don't think I'm going to get a good night's sleep again for some time.
Fly true and strike hard, King's Arrow.
Thanks for getting us out of those crypts. I think I'll do my drinking right here from now on. It's sufficiently Draugr-free.
I need healing. Thank you for everything. I'll see you in Shor's Stone.
Poor thing. Just terrible what's happened to her. After what we've been through, I don't feel right leaving her side, not sure if I ever will.
Sorry, but I'm very busy. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Go on now. Back to the docks with you.\n\nThere's nothing here for the likes of you.
I can't believe that <<1>> was an impostor. He always seemed like a man of decency.
Get out of town while you can. I am.
Curse the Daedra. Damn them to drown in the Font of Harmony.
Go on, mate. \n\nIf things go well, I hope to help you when you face the Admiral.
We just got in a shipment of steins from the Woodhearth. Primitive art is so in fashion these days.
The Stars welcome you, traveler. Take a moment to look over my arms. I assure you—they are as deadly as they are beautiful.
You remind Tuzil of his son's cub. So full of life. This old cat's just good for asking things like 'What can he get you?'
By the Hist, I'll be more careful next time. If you're ever in Duskwallow Hamlet, my nest is yours!
Rulanir didn't deserve that. No one does.
Any Worm Cultist out to defile our shrine gets a mouthful of arrows. Give a whistle if you see them headed this way.
How did you find your way in here?
They lied to us! The damn Maulborn lied to us! Who's going to cure me now?
Meet me at  <<1>>'s longhouse when you're done. If his answers don't satisfy me, we'll put those locks of hair to good use.
We'll have the Spearhead ready to sail for Betnikh the moment you return with Bhosek's records.
Hurry on now. You don't want to be whipped. Bhosek's been doing all too much whipping lately.
Before we leave for Betnikh, talk to the crew. Get familiar with them. It'll be a long trip.
Perhaps he'll listen to me. For once. I swear, I think it's a miracle of the Divines that any of his students last past the first year.
Remember me? You helped me kill that big snake! I decided to ditch my father's old sword for this beauty.
What a marvelous book! I can't wait to read it.
Father lied to me! He said I was powerful! He said I couldn't be defeated! And then you came along. Oh, just leave me alone!
Go forth and know that Daggerfall and the crown stands behind you.
<This Redguard died recently.>
You enjoyed every minute of our little adventure. I can tell by the sparkle in your eyes.
Find the Mane, please. Now, of all times, for the Khajiiti people to lose their way … we can't.
A good fight, stranger.
Now that Faolchu is gone, perhaps we can start to heal.
So, your truthiness overcomes all! My felicitude winds around you like a warm fog.\n\nGive me those meats and I'll expose <<1>>'s perfitudidness.
For what it's worth, I think you did the right thing, destroying that relic. Magic that powerful should not be in the hands of Men.
Urn … dangerous. Cultists summoned terrible … killed them. Take urn to <<1>>. Find <<2>>. Safe with her.
The Moon-Hallowed cannot travel the Two Moons Path with such corruption going on. We need to clean this city for all to be right with our people.
Ungh, finally. Soldier, I'm not going to stay conscious much longer. You have to tell the Centurion.
What does my lord command? Wait, who is my lord again? It's all so muddled.
Have you seen the mewling hounds they call warriors here? They are nothing before the might of Lugrun!
<The corpse of <<1>> has already begun to decay. It will be unrecognizable in a few days.>
What I wouldn't do to be in a nice, safe place. A tavern somewhere, maybe. Warm. A pint of ale. Some good company.\n\nInstead, I'm in Coldharbour. If Molag Bal's minions don't kill me, Skordo surely will.
Blackheart is dead, but he won't stay that way forever. Let's destroy his skull and prevent him from ever returning.
I'm sorry I lied to you. I … I hope we can still be friends.
Don't worry. Girin and I will get in there soon enough.\n\nIn the meantime, keep Indaenir out of trouble.
How did you do with those Black Daggers?
You've done a great service to Greenhill. I'd love to talk, but I really have to finish this inventory.
You monster! My murder wasn't enough?
I heard what you said about Grida. Is it true?
Thank you again. I am very much looking forward to returning to my wife.\n\nI hope she will be as happy to see me.
Thank you again. I had forgotten what it feels like to feel free.
Ah, wayfarer. Eyevea is like a dream come true! Especially the tradescraft! It's so easy to gather spell components! Do you have any idea how expensive it is to import frost herbs through to Alik'r desert?
Me maw cried when I left to come here. Said I'd been stolen by Elves and wizards, and that I'd end up a slave in Oblivion. Hah! As if I could ever be a Daedra's slave!
So, have you decided to help us against the evil Wood Elves?
<<1>>'s inside resting. You have five minutes.
I'm lucky you wandered by when you did. But then again, I'm always lucky.
The Stone Table. Quickly!
Quite the view from up here, don't you think?\n\nIf only the company was equally enjoyable.
You're just … going to abandon me?
<Talania Priscus has died.>
What happened to us?
I'll have a good life here, if you remain quiet about my gift.
Have you seen the Magistrate since her arrest? I suspect she won't live through the night.
We shall see you at Dune, then. I look forward to our next conversation.
New around here, aren't you? I advise you to have a talk with <<1>>.
I wonder where that worthless boy got to. He should've been back with my herbs by now. Oh, pardon me.
You ready to go? I don't know what the Sea Vipers plan, but I doubt we have much time to stop them.
The Queen and the Silvenar are safe as long as we are on watch.
Do not look upon me with pity, brother. Hearts such as ours, crowded with great and terrible purpose, have no room for such things.
So, you did it. Summoner Division Champion! It's an honor.\n\nNormally I'd offer my services as your servant, unfortunately Ishalga has reassigned me to other duties.
Shasirba makes such wonderful baked goods. You should try some yourself! Or, some supplies for the road from me?
I will join you, if you wish. \n\nI am no great warrior. I am only a humble priest, but Tu'whacca says I can be of great assistance to you in this battle. He says it is up to you to make this decision though.
Tu'whacca bless you, O wayfarer. At last I can sleep without fear of the sound of wings.
You are the one who killed my brother Uwafa, are you not?\n\nI will grant that you are likely a formidable foe, but once I become a lich, I will burn you to cinders. There's nothing you can do to stop me now.
The Sea Hawk is just there, on the southern dock. Remember, the silks are likely below deck. And while I know Angore is not aboard, I can't guarantee that his goons won't try to stop you. You look like you can handle yourself though.
Ah, Nirnroot wine, nectar fit for the gods. As long as they can afford my prices that is!
This one hopes the Claw will remain safe now, walker.\n\nWhat an end to a pilgrimage, yes? Still—the Claw is safe. This is what matters, this one thinks.
This one hopes your hands ran red with the blood of the Stonefire.\n\nEither way, you have done the Order of the Claw such a service.
Say what you will about the Thalmor, they know fine cloth when they see it.
It seems the merchant with whom I am meeting has been slain, sera. Such a pity. This … dungheap … has been an excellent source of workers for House Telvanni.\n\nSoon, my partner and I will be recalling to Tel Branora to find other such places.
So Treethane Rolon wants you to investigate the violation of the Green Pact. I don't see what there is to investigate. The culprit is plain enough, but I'm happy to help.
Speak with me when you are done with the siege weapons, warrior.
Come to stare at a dying Nord, eh? Hate to disappoint you. None of it's fatal.
You're <<1>>'s friend, right?
Sounds like we won't need these barricades much longer.
Brackenleaf is pleased, but you are not finished yet. Each hunter is also prey to another hunter. Wolf hunts tiger and tiger hunts snake and snake hunts wolf.\n\nIt's not enough to hunt your prey. You must also prove stronger than those who hunt you.
You needn't make the choice now, but when the hour comes, know that we will stand with you and accept your decision.
Good to see you, comrade. Hope you've had ample opportunity to batter around someone deserving.
I don't know what you did, but the shades are a bit sluggish. We'll hold off the dig until they return to the ground … if they return.\n\nI should send word back to the Mages Guild. They'll want to know everything.
Activate the portal in this chamber so that the rest of the troops can join us.
Your evidence was indisputable, advocate, but it's still hard to believe. Hurry to the judgment cave. The sooner this is resolved, the better.
Mortal, you stand above the sealed ruins of <<1>>. Within is a gateway to <<2>>, where my priestess <<3>> suffers at the hands of Molag Bal. Her pain is so great, it has torn a hole between worlds.\n\nThis injustice must end.
Death needs time to grow what it kills.
Etienne is dead? And, … Squire Theo says the healer is at fault, and dead.\n\nIt is not truly justice, but it is done.
Medya Zurric delivered my brother's children. She was a good woman and you killed her.\n\nBut my house is still on fire. I guess I don't know what to think anymore.
Hey, look who it is. I see you're still kicking. I'm glad, but I'm also jealous.\n\nJust for once, I'd like to leave the boat.
Have you come to pay your respects? If so, I thank you. I am glad to see you here.\n\nNo man should lose his daughter, least of all a king. It is a sad day for Sentinel, but Lakana lives on. She lives now in our hearts.
Hey, good-looking.
You seem very confused, and I am terribly sorry for that, but I'm not lying to you—I've never seen you before.\n\nI hate to be rude, but if this this is the book, would you mind letting me take it back to the Mages Guild?
Impressive … for an outsider.
I'm no fan of the Empire, but if they can wipe out the Reach clans and send me back to my farm … I don't know. Maybe the duke was right.
So the constable's got her old job back? Am I supposed to offer her a toast? I don't think so.
I thought the mayor had fired Agazu because she was an Orc. Sad as all this was, I'm glad to learn that's not the case.
The constable says my job is just to sit here and look pretty.\n\nI think I'm doing that fairly well.
I knew <<1>> wouldn't leave me. We've spent a lot of time in  my wife's homeland of <<2>>, so the unusual fauna here must have spooked him a bit.
<<1>> has finally arrived. Just in time for the ratification ceremony to begin.\n\nI'm sure she will commend you for your efforts.
My hunter returns, briarheart in hand. Brinarch now roams my Hunting Grounds as prey. His chest, a gaping hollow, a reminder of his weakness. Heed his punishment, pup.
Good job. I'm not sure why you got yourself involved in all this, but I don't care. You did well.
In my mind's eye, I witnessed your battle with the Worm Cult, and with the undead Ansei abominations. Your mission was successful, was it not?
I suppose the Baandari helped a bit. But I hardly think launching a few arrows at retreating Imperials evens the score.
Thank you. It will mean a lot to me to have my notes back, at least. Be careful. Aggravated kwama are dangerous, to say nothing of the thunderbugs.
Whatever you do, keep an eye out for any members of my gang. I can't believe they gave up without a fight, but I can believe they're all holed up somewhere. Probably hiding out until this all blows over.
Remember. Move slowly and enter the tunnel one at a time. If we raise any alarms, this mission will be over before it's begun.\n\nGo on. We'll follow right behind you.
I don't know how my neighbors can walk the streets. Everywhere I go, I see where the Jade Butcher's troops killed my friends.
What do you want from me? I have nothing more. Nothing! No home, no family. No future ….
Drink deep from my gift.
You've brought my business back to life, wayfarer! Soon this sleepy market will be a bustling bazaar again!
By Mauloch's left fang! Those whoreson dogs! Sons of trolls! The First Forge burn them!\n\nOgre dung!
You are the hero everyone speaks about, is it not so? There was an Imperial shouting your name as he fled out the back window, and by Tava's red feathers, there was terror in his voice. \n\nWe can but hope he survived. Someone must tell the tale.
You can have the relic if you want it. Needless to say, I won't be taking it with me. That should get me a discount from Dragonstar Caravans, shouldn't it?
His honor is intact.
Go ahead. I do not like being watched while I climb. It is… awkward.
Inspect my notes, Count Verandis. See if you can find a clue that I overlooked. We need to work together to save the Baroness.
You are Undaunted! This one is glad to see a new member. She has nearly run out of bodies to climb over in her glorious rise to the top.\n\nYou will help <<1>> with this, yes? <<2>> has been most uncooperative.
Not afraid of a fight, eh? Good. We need some more honest warriors here.
I'm writing my memoirs—a record of my great deeds!\n\nHow about some refreshment, new blood? Hard to write with a parched throat!
I thought you were on our side! I mean, after all you did for us … er, I mean …. Never mind.
I can't believe you recruited Julien. If I could eat my dagger, I would.\n\nI'm really embarrassed. Here I couldn't manage to get a single recruit, and you come behind me and get three.
I'll miss <<1>>. She was a good … friend.
Greetings and welcome! Do I smell the distinct aroma of vintage lorebooks? Perhaps an ancient scroll? Or is it a musty tome?
Thanks again for retrieving my wares, traveler. I'll make for Kragenmoor soon enough.
Please, don't walk away. Don't ignore me. I really need your help. This blasted war has been devastating to us common folk.\n\nCan you spare a few pieces of gold for a poor beggar?
Eagles advance, traveler! And may the Green watch and keep you.
Welcome to our hall, fellow member. Please make yourself at home.
Aerona has really stepped up as town consul while her brother recovers. He'd better watch out. She may actually be better at the job than he is!
I have my work cut out for me. I need to make enough of the suppressant to treat everyone in the Serk. And then I have to continue trying to find an actual cure.\n\nDamn the Maulborn and their Llodos plague! Damn them to Oblivion and back!
I heard some men talking in the marketplace. They claimed the Iron Orcs are stirring in the northern hills, like they're preparing for something big. I hope it isn't true. We have enough to worry about right now.
Please. Whatever it takes. Find the captain.
Did you hear about the six-legged, spear-tailed, goat-horned, monster? It was all they talked about around the cooking fire last night.\n\nEither red brittle has gotten into the water supply or people are a lot more gullible than I imagined.
Are you ready to be certified? I have time if you do.
<No new commissions are available at this time.>
Your timing is impeccable, my friend.\n\nI must've slaughtered a hundred of them. Never thought I would see the day, but I haven't the strength to swing my sword.
You destroyed the wraith. Not many can say that, friend. You have done his victims, and me a great service. They're free, for now.\n\nUnfortunately, he will be back. He never truly dies. More's the pity, eh?
<The crate contains ample space for deliveries, and a sheaf of manifest papers.>
I'd try to help out, but I have my hands full right now. Come back later.
I only deal with Enforcers. Tedious, I know, but those are the rules. Talk to Osgug, if you must.
That was the last of the fanatics. Your help in this matter is appreciated, but it felt good to run a few through myself.\n\nForge-Mother Alga waits for you outside. She would confer with you about all that happened here today.
I have a feeling that the Wood Elf isn't the only one around here who's been lied to.\n\nHurry back. I don't think we have a lot of time before the Vosh Rakh make their move.
Does this look like a general store? That's my stuff you stole, I'll have you know.\n\nLousy thief.
This place is as scary as it is impressive. I suppose we need to get back in there.\n\nYou go first.
Bazrag says he has a plan.
Speak to General Nesh-Tan. She'll tell you everything you need to know. Good luck.
So? Have you come to a decision on whether you want to help me?
The exile was a Dragon priest? Well, that explains everything! And you killed him?\n\nAs long as you're sure he won't be causing us anymore trouble … but wasn't he dead before you killed him? I just hope he stays that way this time!
It is a true honor to meet the Blademaster and his disciples. I hope to visit the Arena, one day. My lord promised me leave … as soon as the siege ends.
That old bauble that you found isn't worth hauling around. Meram will take it off your hands. And for a good price, too!
What were you and Kurog discussing over there? Anything important?\n\nNo, don't tell me. I really don't care. I just want to get this over with so I can get back to my own stronghold.
Oh friend! It's so good to see you!\n\nAre you surprised? I told you I was going to find my fortune in the big city. And look! Khajiit clothes! Although, I don't think they had Wrothgar's weather in mind when they designed these.
You make sure the Dark Elf shows up and I'll handle getting drunk arses in the seats to hear her sing. I'll even make that worthless bard come out and clap—strained finger be damned!
The thief from … <<1>>, wasn't it? Why are you here?
Find <<1>> when you're done. She's meeting with <<2>> at his shop.\n\nDid you know he had a shop? I wonder what he sells.
Greetings! If hunger has befallen you, perhaps a little sweetroll is the answer.
We have so much to talk about, but this one doesn't know where to start.\n\nMaybe she'd like to hear about the latest Investigator Vale book I read …?
Just leave. You're scaring away my dinner.
I'll stay behind and make sure none of the Cathedral guards get too curious about what we're doing back here. Besides, someone has to show Astara and the others the way inside once they arrive.\n\nSince I'm still recovering, I guess I'll volunteer.
I am happy to be an honorary member of this august organization.\n\nThere aren't any dues to pay, are there? I don't pay dues. It's a religious thing.
Serving drinks isn't so bad. The pirates have been surprisingly polite and well-mannered. Well, except for that one who leered at me. But Anya gave her a look and she hasn't bothered me since.\n\nStill, I'll be glad when my shift ends and I get paid.
I come to investigate the sounds of battle and what do I find? You, standing over the bodies of our fallen foes.\n\nGood work, Assassin.
<Flowers were expertly and recently picked from this plant without damaging either the plant or the remaining blossoms.>
You let her live. I thought I knew you better than that. No one was saved today. We just put off the battle for another day.\n\nJust go. I need to get back to Vvardenfell, anyway. I've had my fill of this tarnished coast.
Bad time for visitors. Lots of omens. Caravans being slaughtered. Hope you're not here to see the sights.
Servants of the Serpent hired the feared Greycloak mercenaries to capture Kelmen Locke.\n\nThe merceneries hold him in a place called Haddock's Market. When they learn all they can, they plan to hand Kelmen over to the Serpent. We need to rescue him.
I just … I just need some time alone. But thank you for helping us.
<It would be impossible to identify whoever this was if it wasn't for the personal effects nearby. The bones have been completely picked clean.>
Didn't you hear me? I said scoot!
Councilor Eris can be found at the Redoran Kinhouse. And do hurry. He's ever so troubled by our failure to locate young Veya.\n\nIf he finds that an outsider can succeed where the House Guard has failed, so be it.
Now we just need to get new miners. Do you know anyone looking for some work?
Well, it's not exactly a lie. And I don't want things to get out of hand.\n\nI'll arrange a meeting, provided Veya agrees. You let Eris know she's safe. Get him to stop hiring freelancers before someone gets hurt. I'll send word when we're ready.
I've told you more than enough. The item you seek is deep in the ruins of Nchuleft.\n\nI provided the information and gave you my warning. What happens next is up to you.
I knew I shouldn't have told Veya the truth. I just made everything worse.\n\nPlease, let us out of here. We have to stop Veya before she does something she'll regret.
Because of you I may now have a future filled with freedom once again. Thank you.
<This tile shows the letter "M" as written in the Daedric script.>
What? Did you think I was so depressed that I'd drink myself silly and fall into the ocean? Well, I'm neither drunk enough or motivated enough to walk that far.\n\nAnd I prefer my water to be warm and full of bubbles.
"In a battle with Mehrunes Dagon, Vivec gave his own silver longsword to the Daedra Lord rather than dishonor himself by fighting an unarmed foe. This so impressed the Dremora that they now share a bond of respect with the followers of the Tribunal."
We salvaged our dignity by ending Marshal Hlaren's reign of corruption. Perhaps the Scarlet Judge isn't so bad after all.
I am honored to attend such a prestigious event. And in such a lovely city, too!\n\nYou know, this trip has helped me realize that I haven't seen enough of Tamriel. There's nothing stopping me from visiting great cities like this one, thanks to you.
I see that you returned, but where's Initiate Favar? More importantly, did you get the readings with the perception tabulator?
I just don't understand why my plants won't grow while Chirrhari and Ohtowen have no trouble making things bloom. It's an absolute annoyance!\n\nAnd so are those fabricants. Feel free to smash them to bits on your way through the garden.
Begone, whoever you are! I sealed the door, and it shall remain sealed for as long as necessary!
I thank you, walker. Lankin would not have lasted much longer in this dungy place. You will lead me out now, yes?
The sequence plaques in your possession have no copies. Please return them to the archive.
Warning. Situation critical. Daedric threat rating increased to severe.
I can't wait to give Kireth a piece of my mind—right after you talk to her. If she's still angry, you can calm her down a bit before I let her know what I really think. No reason for her to hit both of us, after all.
My clan will drink to your health tonight. We've all wanted to head back to Morkul for years, but couldn't do so in honor without our clan's sword. Now we can, thanks to you.\n\nMay Mauloch keep your blade sharp, traveler!
I'm so proud! I nearly retched just thinking about the last stew, but I held it together. Oh, and I'm glad I did! Brengolin really worked a miracle this time!\n\nWe might just be able to kick the paste after all!
The next step involves a thorough examination of the strange pearl you and Valsirenn recovered from beneath the Shimmerene monastery. Hopefully, we can learn more about the false Aldarch and the source of the pearl's magic.
Talk to Bailiff Roland. He apparently enjoys dealing with bothersome newcomers.
I told Filbert this was a mistake. Peryite protects us, but trying to proselytize on an island where Daedra worship is frowned upon was never a good idea in the first place.
I remember the words, but I don't know exactly what they mean. Once I begin the spell, be ready for anything.
Sotha Sil waits for you in his study. Tell him about the alliance with the Daedric Princes and ask him if he knows what we can expect to face inside the Crystal Tower.\n\nI'll wait for Darien and Leythen to return.
Mmm! Just look at these tasty piggies!
I believe there's a certain Khajiit who wishes to speak to you. Go on and make sure he hasn't gotten himself into any trouble.\n\nAnd just know, the Psijic Order will always consider you an ally and friend. As will I.
Beware the temptations of power, initiate. Countless mages have fallen prey to the allure of legendary artifacts like these fragments.\n\nIn all things, seek peace, simplicity, and detachment.
You are now free to accept jewelry crafting writs.\n\nBe advised that while the jewelry you create may be beautiful, you'll need to conduct further research if you wish to add the traits most adventurers seek.
I may be injured, but my shop is still open. Perhaps it will do you some good, in such troubling times.
You come in peace, yes? If not, my Zan'hi will claw you to ribbons!
Feels good to have the old flame back again!\n\nI have to say, it feels strange talking to someone I know could kick my arse in a fight, even if it was my shadow self. Just know you're one of a very few, my friend!
A thousand greetings, wayfarer, but I do not think we have anything further to discuss. Now go away.
I calibrated the skeevaton to seek out the energy emitted by a soul gem. A powerful one. Follow it and it'll spare you a lot of rooting through scrap.
The shell of the dream grows thin, Rootmender. Soon it will crack. If you have questions, ask them now.
Please let Famia know I will arrange a meeting with the Dead-Water tribe very soon. You should attend, I think. When you are ready to go, meet me at Bright-Throat Village's southern gate.\n\nSee you soon, beeko.
I hope you're prepared for this ritual, friend.\n\nI mean, I suppose it's possible that it will be a pleasant romp in some Argonian spirtual paradise … but I doubt it.
Hopefully next time we meet, it will be under happier circumstances.\n\nFor now, feel free to talk to Seeks-the-Dark. I'm sure he's just overflowing with gratitude for all that you've done for him!
<<<1>> coos excitedly and nods toward Varona.>
Did Tharayya convince you to join us? I hope you fare better with the Goblins.
And I was so looking forward to visiting Lilmoth. I've heard it's lovely this time of year.
I joined Cyrodilic Collections for excitement and a bit of gold, not to be abducted and interrogated like a common hood!\n\nUgh! This place is just a pit. I'm heading back to Anvil first chance I get.
Jaxsik will make an excellent leader. You chose well, friend-outsider.
Sithis hasn't made a meal of you yet, so I guess you're getting acclimated. Of course, you've been devoted in your offerings. Keep the serpent fed and it has little reason to bite.
I'm excited to visit the Root-Whisper tribe. It's not everyday that one gets to see a newly awakened Hist.
The phlegmwine is still bubbling, have some before the bog gasses run dry!
What is the delay? We should leave for the Halls of Colossus immediately. We must get to the weapon before Euraxia's forces do.
We accomplished much, but I fear we haven't seen the last of Kaalgrontiid. I must investigate reports coming from the south.\n\nYou, however, have a queen to crown! Take Cadwell with you and make sure he behaves. And tell Khamira … she did admirably.
Do not fear for me, walker. I have been Gharesh-ri's agent for most of my life.\n\nI will see you in Riverhold after I take care of my fallen soldiers.
My sources indicated that my son's murderer was somewhat … taller. Ah, well.\n\nNow, why in the world should I even consider negotiating with the monster who murdered my dear Javad?
Star Haven is safe, but the danger is far from over. I fear there is still much to do, walker.
Once, Elsweyr was sixteen distinct kingdoms. Like the many forms of the Khajiit, they worked in harmony to create a peaceful and prosperous land.\n\nBut the Thrassian Plague upset this balance, causing two kingdoms to rule above all.
I heard that commotion from halfway across the temple. Nisaazda managed to get that giant sentinel moving after all. She's more dangerous than I gave her credit.
Thank you for helping to restore the bloodline of Anequina, walker. It is good to see a Khajiit once again on the throne of Rimmen.\n\nCashia apologizes for all the formality, but she had to be sure before she bestowed the Mane's blessing upon Khamira.
This Nord had better be finished with his cooking by the time Asaldak arrives. Asaldak does not like to be kept waiting.
Zargha feels foolish. Who could fear butterflies? But he cannot look upon them any longer without deep feelings of dread. It didn't used to be this way, but he cannot remember what changed.
You have done much since we last met, traveler!\n\nThis one knew you had a brave heart, but never did he imagine you would become the savior of Elsweyr. Thank the Moons we happened upon the wreckage of your caravan.
I heard all about what happened with that mangy beast, Kaalgrontiid. Well done, my friend! I just wish I had been able to join you. It sounds like it was a worthy quest indeed!\n\nAlas, I had to see a Daedric Lord about a mind shriven horse.
<Apple is saddled and ready to go.>
Leave the Dragonguard behind? I hope Queen Khamira knows what she's doing. Still, I understand the precaution. She shows wisdom by formulating an alternate strategy.\n\nThe Dragonguard will stand ready. I'll join you in the portal.
Vijari, Vijari, comes to thee. He can't see, Dak'radhi.
I will listen to the Dragonguard's proposition. Laatvulon has his allies. Perhaps it is time that I find my own.
This one would offer you a drink but… the bottle is almost empty. Also, Zurnash does not like to share.
Why do you wish to enter the Black Kiergo, friend of Caska? Are you looking for a fight?
<An aura of cold menace surrounds this eerie wicker pike. Destroying it might have some effect on the Icereach Coven's storm-summoning ritual. Beware, though. Meddling with effigies like this can have terrifying consequences ….>
Laatvulon's followers swarm the skies. The longer I remain, the greater chance I will be discovered.\n\nTell me. Have you found Yahgrondu?
Welcome! What can Movasso help you with today? Do you need a place to rest? Perhaps food and drink?
Those who hide, those who fight, those who pray to uncaring gods. They all shall know the glory of the New Moon as it rises.\n\nWill you look up in fear, initiate? Or will you rise with it?
After everything I've seen, I can no longer place my faith in Meridia. But I refuse to abandon my friends.
We know enough about Tzinghalis's refinement processes to replicate his methods, but we still need a source of netherroot to do so.\n\nTell Svana that if she can keep us supplied, we can produce enough elixir for all the holds in a matter of weeks.
Princess—Jarl Svana reminds me more of the queen every passing moment. We're in good hands, I think.
We can heal the injured, but Meridia's light does nothing for the corrupted.\n\nHopefully, you can find a way to save us from these cursed storms.
Who's this? Strong, sober, well-equipped? The Coterie of Organized Scholars needs adventurers of your stripe! Our research very much depends on it.\n\nOur fieldwork is fascinating, satisfying, and it pays quite … well, there is payment. Interested?
I'm biding my time. I think the Broker has something truly magnificent for the finale. Like a Dragon horn, or a Snow Elf statue.\n\nHa! With the Broker, who knows?
Rigurt hopes these talks go well! \n\nThe Skald-King plans to send him on another mission soon. Hopefully it will be a place where the people are excited to embrace Nord culture!
It's a sad day for Solitude. I remember when the king and queen married. Now she's gone?\n\nSomeone will pay dearly for this.
Blood now runs here as it did where I just came from. Royal blood, too. Is Rathzin cursed to venture to places filled with death?
Be careful. Skor is not himself. There's nothing left of him inside that mindless beast.
The decrees from the Blue Palace are simply absurd. Investigating transfers of suspected stolen property? Who cares where someone got it? If I want it, and they have it, I should be able to buy it!
The Dragon Cult's lair, Dragonhome, is further west, as is the altar where you'll place my belongings. You'll need to put me inside your pack so I can direct you and offer guidance. \n\nDon't make a fuss of it.
I admit—I underestimated you. Once we heard the fighting begin, I assumed your distraction would be short-lived. The mindless creatures that crawl around this castle aren't known for toying with their prey.\n\nThankfully you survived.
We'll show the Gray Host. We'll show everyone. The Ghostsong clan still has some fight left in it. Just point us at the prey and let us loose!
How I have missed our endless debates, my friend. Our deep and fascinating discussions about science and philosophy. I look forward to renewing that exchange.\n\nIf you haven't presented yourself yet, you should go see Lord Rada al-Saran.
<Reproducing this experiment has already yielded great alchemical results for you.>
Good work, partner. It's always a pleasure to fight by your side. \n\nForgive me for saying this, but I hope we don't need to do that again for quite some time.
<This scroll bears the insignia of the Undaunted and a potent spell, conceived of by the renowned Hroltar the Boaster. When invoked the scroll will empower one's enemies with astonishing power.\n\nThe full incantation isn't short on colorful language.>
I need to report in to Jarl Svana and the rest of the contingent from Western Skyrim—after I quench my thirst. The road we traveled was long and dusty.\n\nRemember, the Reachwind Ritual Site. That's where you'll find Lyris Titanborn.
I thought the gods had cursed me to that fate. As if exile from my clan was not enough.\n\nBut then you came. I see it now. I have been given a second chance.
I'm not sure who you are, but you seem to have The Ard's ear.
It's a grand occasion you've delivered us to, outsider. I'm glad Medone and I could be a part of it.
You fought like a true Reachman today, traveler.
I'm glad to know we're soon to see the end of this. But I need to rest up while I can. Once we're back inside, I expect to be at the forge non-stop.
Good to see you! Your advice paid off. No Minotaurs, monsters, or other misadventures befell me on the way to Gideon.\n\nI might not have found the recognition I hoped for, but I'm safe and sound. The curse of Phalevon's horn is broken.
Sombren was only trying to help us. I know that. But he still led us to that evil place.\n\nWhatever Xynaa was doing to us, though, it siphoned off some of my power. I think I can use my fire now. Control it. At least for a while.
Well, Igmund's back, and sore as ever. Did kind of miss his complaining. Gets too quiet otherwise.
You know, come to think of it, I missed out on a golden opportunity while my stupid brother was a pig. I've heard they can sniff out rare mushrooms with their snouts. I should have had him find me some before we changed him back.\n\nOh well.
You! You're the one I don't know. Why are you here? I—I didn't run away again! I promise.
I'm kind of beat after—croak!—all that. You should talk to my—bok! bok!—sister.
Featherless! What a wonderful celebration these wingless giants have thrown in our honor!\n\nWe must fill the sky with our cries of victory. Shriek our accomplishments for all to hear. Shriek! Shriek!
I had lost hope before you came. Then, the Winds returned. Like the sun rising to warm my scales, I could feel promise again. Blessings to you and your eggs.
This party is exactly how I like them. Keshu the Black Fin really knows how to throw a celebration. Reminds me of the feasts that Otumi-Ra throws. We might be up until the morning frogs sing.
Hiring a common sellsword? I thought Captain Rian and his Ivory Brigade were better than that.
You sow the seeds of prosperity wherever you tread, laborer! Zenithar smiles upon your work, as do we all.
Right, so turns out vampires are in fact not immune to fire. Who would have thought it?\n\nAnd, I forgot to tell you which part of Elsweyr I was going to again, didn't I? I'm so forgetful—especially when I'm in front of my heroes, I get all nervous!
No more fortunes for you today, my friend. Looking at the future of one so bright as you makes Zahsbi's eyes hurt.
I admire Lucilla's convictions, even if they're going to get her killed one day. Deserting the legion would be insane if the Empire wasn't in shambles.\n\nThe best I can do for Lucilla is report her as presumed killed in action.
We should not remain here. I opened a portal to Fargrave. Let us meet there to discuss what we should do next.
I understand there's a town nearby protected from Dagon's influence. Perhaps I'll start there. Someone should know how to get back to Nirn.
What do you speak with this one for? Did Witchmother Taerma not give you a task?
There's always opportunities in Fargrave for the ambitious and skilled. Take a contract with the Saraathu Tong and you won't have to fight everyone else for work.
You … are not one of these monsters. Daedra. Tormenters. They … questioned me. Wanted me to demonstrate how to inscribe the runes.\n\nI tried to resist … tell Sister Celdina … I tried ….
I'll meet you in Fargrave at The House of Whims. Once we talk to Madam Whim and Calia, we can decide who to track down next.
Explain yourself, stranger. The Deadlands isn't a place for chance encounters.
You're back and not even a little bit charred. The sign of an overwhelmingly successful fight. \n\nDo you have the bodies? Is the Mantikora dead?
A mortal, holding the chains of the infamous Lyranth Foolkiller? I think that says more about Lyranth's overblown reputation than it does about your abilities, devastator. Wouldn't you agree?
Remember, Wretched Spire. In the Deadlands. If you don't meet Lyranth there by the appointed time, Madam Whim won't reduce my debt. Then I'll have done all that running around for nothing.
So that oily little pest is yours? You should keep it on a shorter leash.\n\nHmph. I assume you take full responsibility for its vicious outburst?
Kynareth light your way, fellow traveler.
Such an interesting adventure, don't you think? I must write down the pertinent details. Wouldn't want to forget a moment! And don't fret. I'll make sure to send for you when the situation on High Isle escalates. You're too good not to call on again.
Well. I suppose this is meant to be flattering, but it's all rather awkward. I have no idea who that scoundrel is or what he thinks he's doing!\n\nHow much longer do my guards intend to let this spectacle go on?
Far be it for me to tell anyone they ought to get a move on, but the Ascendant Order's sailing toward the alliance leaders and Lady Arabelle needs our help.\n\nThis one sounds important.
Young Audrine makes a bold proclamation. While I believe the spirit of this grove spoke through her, I find it hard to imagine that one of our druids could be responsible for unbalancing nature. That goes against everything we believe.
You have my gratitude, hero. I doubt Seraphyne or I would have survived if you hadn't come along when you did.
I think I made things perfectly clear, mainlander. I haven't seen Count Damard all day, and Duchess Elea does not care to entertain visitors. \n\nLeave, or I will summon Dufort knights to drag you away.
My faithful steward, an agent of the Ascendant Order? It just goes to show you can never truly trust the household staff.
What do you say, adventurer? Gonfalon Bay could use your help and we pay well.
I think I can bear this Breton paradise a little longer. Consider it my way of acknowledging everything you did for us. For me.\n\nIf you could go out of your way to save three foolish royals, then I can try to find common ground with my enemies.
Despite everything that happened, we're alive and well. Perhaps Lord Bacaro's dream of peace isn't dead after all. I came here to be polite, but now … who knows?
Look away from poor Halz. He will be right as the rains on the plain, just as soon as he makes his poultice.
Don't know who those bastards were, or what they wanted. Thanks for jumping in though. \n\nYou really gave them a run for their coins, hah!
The three of you represent the Gonfalon Chapter's best hopes for a title—I would hate for Sorinne to miss her chance. She's worked so hard to reach this point!\n\nI did not see where she went, but someone in the hall might know.
Off to Seyda Neen? Kill as many of the Dark Elves that you can. It helps me sleep better.
Serving as an agent for three alliances that really can't stand each other is difficult, but as a neutral party, at least they trust the Fighters Guild. Mostly.\n\nBut you look like you need something. Did Wayllod send you about the job?
You're leaving us? Oh gods. I really am going to die in here.
Oh! Maybe you can help!\n\nI've fallen on hard times. I hoped that Zenithar might favor me and help me secure my fortunes, but—well, I don't know how to ask a god for their … anything really.
Well, that was quite something to see! I envy your life of adventure and derring-do, my friend.\n\nSometimes I imagine striking out with nothing but a sword and a good pair of boots … but what would become of Lady Laurent? She'd be lost without me.
Stay back! This one was just looking at the gate and regretting the choices that led her to this fate.
Let me add my thanks to all these accolades, my friend. Your courage and resolve stopped a true villain from gaining terrible power. And you saved many lives. You have the gratitude of the Aldmeri Dominion.\n\nAnd of its queen.
Well. Duchess Elea has rather neglected the castle's library, if you ask me. There were more books here back in her grandfather's day.
Za'ji senses a great battle ahead. He will be right there with you, five-claw. Or maybe a little behind you? Or with the Pounce? Yes, someone must guard the Pounce! But Za'ji will be with you in spirit!\n\nNow go. Lady Arabelle is waiting at the manor.
Dhulef will take Frii to a House Mornard galleon. He'll escort them to Y'ffelon and protect them while we rescue Druid Laurel and the others.\n\nAs for our transportation, we need different arrangements. I'll meet you at the docks soon.
For someone who isn't a Sea Elf, you certainly make an impression. The Gilded Blades could use a fighter like you. If you're ever looking for work, look me up. The lordling says the Mad Maiden will always have a berth here if I want it.
Let's hope that with Bacaro dead, what remains of the Ascendant Order and the last of the Firesong rebels will no longer be a threat.\n\nNow, go talk to our companions, my dear. They want to have a word with you before we return to Galen.
The ward should be gone now. Let's go through that door and find Frii.
This is so … exciting! I've always wanted to attend a function such as this. Stefan used to tell me stories about them. He seemed to hate these sorts of events, but to me they sounded fascinating!
He's been through here. I'd know that stench of his anywhere.
I'm not sure why the lordling invited me to this, and I'm not sure why I decided to come. I suppose it's interesting to see how the various alliances negotiate. It appears to be a lot less bloody than the functions I've attended in Pyandonea.
I was told this was a celebration, but I think there are too many long faces for that to be true. You'd better give these good folk something to smile about.
We yield, mainlander. The Firesong want no more of this madness.\n\nArchdruid Orlaith led us down a dark path. We want to return to the Green. Rejoin the other circles and end the bloodshed. You have my word on that.
Ah, would you care to help me test out some magic I'm working on? I promise it will be amusing, not deadly.
Captain Rama deliberately stole the totem to provoke the Stonechewers.\n\nAs long as that totem remains on the tower, we'll never be rid of those Goblins.
There's a sight for sore eyes, and surely a guiding light for any ships coming into port.\n\nYou saved the lives of a lot of sailors.
Hey—I know you! We killed that crazy old necromancer together—Angof. Remember that midnight talisman we used to break into Cath Bedraud? I still can't believe that worked. \n\nSo I don't suppose you need help with something fun like that?
Unishi is pleased to see you again. You have made the deliveries to this one's clients, yes?
I told you! I don't know anything. Go away!
We were able to get all the villagers through the portal. They're safe in our camp for now.
We're not warriors. I'm a potter, for Stendarr's sake! We were lucky you came along.
Captain Rosalind! I've been making poultices for the wounded, but I'm out of hawthorn berries.
Once you acquire my lockbox, please hold onto it until we're safely away from those dastardly bandits.\n\nAnd do be careful. I'd hate to think that someone got hurt trying to help me.
You made it! I was worried about you.
Safe journeys to you. Wherever your path leads, remember what you've learned at Leki's Blade.
Greetings.\n\nIt's nice to see another strong guild member around here. Our numbers aren't what they used to be. Live by the sword and all that.
The contract between the Saltwalkers and the Withered Hand was broken before it even began. And those mercs now consider us blood enemies.\n\nI'm tempted to offer you a percentage of the coin we take from them. Tempted.
You've been in the belly of the Covenant's beast. Tell me. Is <<1>> safe?
<You've emptied this chest.>
We must warn the hold of the imminent Goblin attack. \n\nGo warn Hrogar. I'll find Gar and Bjorick and try to get them to safety.
So that's what happened! I remember many mages dying, and there was something about a shield spell. \n\nI grew weak holding him in place. Then there was a bright light. Everything fades after that.
Excellent. The guardians are here. Time to bind this creature.
I don't know what to say.
Why are you still here? You have a spy to expose!
Yet another murder in Stormhold ….
The artifact is ready. Do not unseal it until it's time.
The news is most dire. <<1>> is missing!
I think they're all here!
My family's townhouse is nearby. I'll meet you there.
Do I still look poisoned? I feel different. Gods, I bet they laid eggs in my head!
You stopped the skin-stealers in <<1>>. I can go home!
What tales did the dead men tell, my friend?
Look what they've done to the books. They're ruined. \n\nAll that knowledge. Lost.
Thank the Three, someone who looks like they can handle themselves in a fight!\n\nMy husband's in danger. Please, help us!
Merric will know what to do. This one is planning to practice her bladework while you two are working inside.
Please don't damage him … much. He's very dear to me.
<cough> Please I do not have much time. Please retrive the crystals.
Thank Kyne you made it out alive!
My joy, my heart … <<1>> lives! Though who knows when I will be able to provide her and her father safe shelter, at least they both live.
Is it over? Are they gone? I don't think I hear them in my head anymore.\n\nYour face still drips with blood.
Comrade, <<1>> has sent me to find you.
I see you met Thane Oda Wolf-Sister.
The Worm Cult piled the spriggans' corpses like so much cordwood. Their disrespect knows no bounds.\n\nBurn what's left of the spriggans. You must deny the necromancers the heartwood.
I'm not sure we'll ever feel safe here again.
You're right. This is going to work out. I love to go delving without a care, but Raynor can't stand it when everyone mocks him and doesn't take him seriously.\n\nI can understand it. Raynor deserves a little recognition.
Smoke fills the sky! From Nimalten to Shor's Stone, the people of the Rift know there's danger coming. Well done, my friend.
Alert the heralds. Irnskar's errand runner has returned.
You have the soul of Ysgramor and the heart of a giant-killer.\n\nThank you, friend! We'll always remember you.
You have made your decision. Majorn doesn't take such insults lightly. I expect that you won't have that long to regret your choice before Majorn destroys you.
Ah, the sweet smell of Maormer boats on fire. I quite like the aroma.\n\nSince you're here, may I conclude you've finished your task?
I'm afraid you just missed Commander Yjarnn. Again.\n\nHe was in a hurry. He always seems to run when everyone else around here just saunters.
What's that smell? It's awful.
The matrons are awake! It was much easier to enter, but I still sense … danger.
You'd better get out of here. You've made enemies here.
Without your help here, the tale of Andewen in Ezduiin would have gone very differently, I think.\n\nGood luck in your travels.
She's made it to the crypts? Hmm. Well, at least now she's surrounded by family.
I hope someday Telenger will look upon me as he does Andewen. I want to prove myself.\n\nI just don't want to end up like Uricantar.
<Velatosse stares at you, her eyes dead inside.>
The Battlereeve tells me Estre is dead. I mourn her loss. \n\nShe is the past. And you, our future. Your service to our people has been exemplary. You have proven yourself a valuable asset to the Aldmeri Dominion.
I'm very worried about my cooks. I hope you can find whatever's causing the trouble!
Explain yourself. What are you doing here?
I warned her. I told her I'd never been on a ship before. I think she was fine with my work.\n\nUntil I threw up on her boots.
Defeat Ulfnir, then search him. We must get that crown!
Palith will come to forgive me in time. I may not ever forgive Eranamo.
Good luck. If you need us, the Marines have your back.
Two of my scouts came back. Who was the traitor?
No! Nurad is … This one does not know where these supplies came from. Do not hurt Nurad!
An impressive time. You've passed the Veil's trial of endurance.
Mara's heart, you've done good work here. Little wonder Razum-dar trusts you.
She just wants to get out of here.
The shrine is in the middle of the village. The lady's grace is embodied in the green which shelters the stone.
You're a real live person, aren't you? I thought I was all alone out here. I bet you came from that city over there.\n\nCould you help me, please?
Please, help them.
We never should have left Cloudrest. My mother was right.
This is unacceptable! And all my husband's fault!
Hhmph. Good luck. You'll need it with that creature.
Guard duty is tougher than I thought. But I can't let <<1>> down.
Brute-vitar sealed us out. <<1>>'s fellows all dead, killed by dirty snake-ladies. No doubt this Pact-soldier kills poor <<1>> now.\n\nThis swamp, I hate it. Endless woe! Poor <<1>>!
Let's take the fight to these rabble.
If you can help <<c:1>> again, we'd all be in your debt.
Keep moving. I'm in no mood to chat.
At last! <<1>> is defeated! The tortured souls, now avenged! \n\nLong have I waited for this day!
I have nothing else to say to you.
Stay your blade, Orc. The fight is over.
If you have come to help, tend to the wounded first. They may turn if left to die.
Any questions you have about the job or your compensation should be directed to my father at the main camp to the north east.\n\nNow if you don't mind, I want to enjoy the nature all around us. Time to do more fishing!
So, you've decided to help that drunkard, have you? No, no, do not deny it … your perfitudiousness is as plain as the flagrebex on your wheezax.\n\nGo, give her the meats you hunted. I know the truth, but can't prove it. She wins.
Kindly traveler, thank you. I thought I'd never see another friendly face again.
Are you the Moon Hallowed?
The logging chief's cabin is at the other end of the camp. Just make sure you watch out for the trolls and the spriggans.
I came here to get away from people. All their talk, talk, talk! Who cares which lizard killed which mer?\n\nI've got enough to worry about without listening to their noise.
I don't think I'd be much use to you in this condition. Go on, leave me here. There may be others who need your help.\n\nAnd if you find a Redguard named Sud-Hareem, tell him I'm here. Tell him I'm waiting for his orders.
Be careful. <<1>> is tougher than he looks. And he looks pretty tough.
The Elder Scroll of Altadoon has been returned to its rightful place!
Ezreba will leave Greenhill, never to return.
Please take care of those necromancers. It gives me the creeps thinking about what they're up to in that cave.
Hey there friend. I have a secret, if you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on it.
I want to go back to Stros M'Kai, but no one will sail me there. My life couldn't get worse.
Who are you? What do you want?
I hope that sand makes Hisham reconsider being a farmer. He should be wielding that old spiked mace of his rather than a shovel.
Move with purpose, slowpaws. Only the fleet of foot survive.
I've wasted decades studying Ayleid wells, and I know less now than I did when I started. I'm ready to give up.
I know Hannura will like the fish. Cold-water fish are her favorite.
And now I fade. Where will I go? What realm will I next call home?
Have you found my ring yet? I don't want to return to my mother without it.
Thank you again for your help. For choosing me. But I wish that both Zur and I could have been saved.
I hope you've come bearing good news, comrade.
The moonlight illuminates each of our paths and guides us to where we could go. Did the moon shine similarly for you?
By the tip of my staff, this place is fascinating. The flora and fauna are remarkable. And probably dangerous.
Our Justice heaps shame upon himself and all of Ruptga's children. \n\nMay his bones bleach and our memory of him fade.
Aye, this'll do just fine.
My killer comes to humiliate me once again? Well, know that your luck won't help you here.\n\nI do hope you compete in this game. I so want to get another chance to rip out your heart and pull out your spine!
The information you provided was very useful.
You there! The Maormer attacked <<1>> with their Sea Viper forces. We need every able body for the rescue effort!
Fight or begone. I have no patience for unhatched eggs.
Go on in. I'll climb up the building from the outside; the harpies won't hurt me. Meet me on the balcony with whatever you find.
I am Grexev, lord of this border realm of Coldharbour. How pleasant to meet a mortal of your caliber so willing to kill three tormented souls.\n\nYou would make an excellent Daedra.
Sigul-jo is angry. He is right to be so, but it clouds his thoughts and taints his spirit.
Thank you for speaking with her. Very kind of you to stick your neck out for a stranger.
It's a lovely day for a fight to the death, isn't it?
Kauzanabi-jo was wrong about coming here. Hopefully, the twins have learned much from this visit.
Weight and balance are key, O wayfarer. Have you taken up a Breton blade? Onsi keep you if you must bear one in battle. Better to wield a boatman's oar, I say.
There you are. I felt embarrassed at my cowardice, sending you back after this thing after I'd fled. I thought I'd come to help you avenge my companions.
All this sneaking and crawling around. It doesn't sit well with me.\n\nStill, the element of surprise provides a sound, tactical approach to the current situation.
Exciting, eh? Beasties with wings, an angry Valkynaz—you even managed to befriend a Dremora. Clever, that. \n\nI made friends with a Dremora once. We had some grand adventures, right until she tried to cut out my lungs. Oh, those were good times!
I can't stop hearing Halalin screaming. What were they doing to him? I don't want to know.
I do not know who's doing more property damage—the harpies or those twice-cursed mercenaries. Either way, I've been pumping the bellows like mad.
This inn used to be the jewel of Kozanset. It will take months to recoup our losses—maybe years.
Oh, good. You made it back! My band owes you a debt of gratitude. It isn't often you meet such selfless travelers here.
Come closer—let me get a good look at you.\n\nI'll need to remember your face for when they haul your body out with the others. So I can remember to check my bets, ha!
What have you come for pilgrim? Are you looking for me?
Did one of our scouts find you and send you this way? It doesn't matter, we're desperately in need of assistance.\n\nIf you are willing to help us, please step inside the cave behind me and speak with our treethane.
We have always been a close-knit community, and many relationships were tried and fragmented in this ordeal. It will take us a while to recover.\n\nNevertheless, we are at peace with the forest once more, and that's all thanks to you.
Oh! About time you arrived. Listen, Blackheart is down on the shore somewhere.\n\nHe likes to pace the beach when he's on shore leave. And he doesn't find it funny when I point that out to him. Can you blame me for jumping ship?
<<1>> can answer your questions, citizen.
I told you not to follow me. I didn't want anyone else to die. Why did you have to follow me?
The time has come for another foray into Oblivion, Vestige. We have one last ally in need of rescue.
Someone needs to deal with whatever's happened on these docks, and you're the one I'd trust to do it. Get out there.\n\nWe'll be fine. I'll have bandages ready in case anyone is wounded.
I would walk on if I were you, stranger. This town is cursed.
Hello! Do you have business for the Guild?
Yet another hopeful? Don't look like much.\n\nIt'd be wise for you to wait a few days to compete. I'll have moved on by then. You might actually have a chance!
I feel so beautiful and … tall. I could get used to this.
<<1>> was such a grimy place. The new mayor is really cleaning things up, don't you agree?
I thought I recognized you! You were right in the middle of those Imperial bastards. Well done, comrade. Stendarr protect you.
Oh divine lord, protector of the eternal balance between life and death, I beseech you … remove this dark curse from your sacred grounds …
Thank you for your faith in me. I will do all that I can to prove I deserve this honor.\n\nAnd you. You will always be welcome in Shornhelm.
And so the Infinium becomes mine again. As it always does.\n\nYou performed well against Graccus.
My people are lucky to have someone like you standing by the candidates. Well done, Hallowed.
Follow the pull of your blood and you will find the Tomb of the Blood Matron.
Our people are doomed. The High Elves will stomp us out.
My beautiful abomination, how you shine in the dark. \n\nNow, listen.
I hope you didn't travel from far away just to see <<1>>. I am not performing at present.\n\nMy magic cannot function safely in front of a crowd. The, uh, stars are out of alignment.
You reek of kwama juices … why don't you come inside and spend some time with your granny Alyxe? \n\nI'll have a hearty chunky brain stew ready soon, or do you like it spongey and raw?
I have begun to wonder whether all scholars are as troublesome as this one.
You return. Did you have any luck finding the remaining fragments?
Thanks for putting that cat in her place. Those people can be so stubborn.\n\nThe Khajiit need to understand that some of their cultural rituals are taboo to the rest of the Dominion. Those of us who are civilized, anyway.
Hail, O wayfarer. I beg you, forgive Khada if she has given you cause for offense. She has a temper, and this Imperial occupation has put a strain on all of us.
Please—talk some sense into that Wood Elf. I don't know anything about the Green Pact that he's talking about.\n\nI've been eating flowers my whole life. They're delectable!
My daughter won't even speak to me. Watch this. <<1>>! <<1>>!\n\nShe's never forgiven me for our problems. Well, I've trouble of my own.
Thank you, kind soul. Thank you for sparing my life.
I think I've run out of tears at this point. How could the gods allow this to happen?
Once we get to Coldharbour, it'll be open season on Daedra!
After getting captured by those Goblins in Stonefalls, I've had my fill of them!
If it isn't the hero of the alliance!
Greetings, bold adventurer! I am <<1>>, servant of the Daggerfall Covenant and honorary member of the Undaunted. It's truly a pleasure to meet you.\n\nI'm told the newest members buy the drinks around here. What do you say, friend?
Hello! I have many fine pots and pitchers, and inside many of them, many fine things to drink.\n\nYou wish to trade for any of these things?
Welcome, Mage. Feel free to make use of our humble facilities here as you will.\n\nThey are here for Mages Guild use, after all.
I can't believe that <<1>> is dead. She was a good soldier. And a good woman. She will be missed.
No. I'm not coming. No, I'm not. Don't even ask. I'll come back, but only when Gaillard says it's safe. Yes, that's right. Only when Gaillard says.\n\nGaillard told me to stay right here until then.
Rohlbert is so brave, acting through hired assassins and spies. Let's see how brave he is when Adusa and Five-Claws come to call!
The stars have accepted you. I just hope it is not too late.\n\nVolumes of prophecy have been written about the stars, but not even the oracles foresaw these events.
I wish I'd studied my cleansing spells more diligently. It'll take days to wash the dog-stink out of this room. \n\nBut please forgive my grumbling. You're most welcome in our hall.
It's times like these when I wish I had more help around here.\n\nIs there something I can get you?
Glad you aren't scared off like some other folks. You'd think they'd never seen another Bosmer before.
My sweet Mirilir. I would say that I miss him, but I know that I will follow him soon enough. I am ready now.\n\nBut you, you're so kind. Did you find the Nereid's Smile?
You can find Erold in our observatory, up on the top of the hill.
If we're going to learn what happened to the atronachs, you must rescue Kelmen Locke from the Greycloak mercenaries.
I'll be returning to Belkarth soon. I just need to finish a few things here first.\n\nI might even bring some of this wine back with me. Stars know we could always use more wine at the observatory.
Little goat is still here? Why? Little goat has work to do! Don't come back until the task is done!
Sobabe appreciates all you have done. She thinks she is finished with adventuring. She had her fill in Oblivion. Now she will fill with delicious moon-sugar—to forget the battle and the blood.
I could have saved you a lot of trouble if I had brought my brother's radial component extractor with me. But what can I say? I'm spontaneous!\n\nI'll finish up here and meet you by the main entrance after you get the power core.
You're back. I assume Watcher's Hold is in disarray?
How long are you going to have us standing here? Let's move!\n\nI want my throne room back!
Another recruit? We are glad to have you, friend. But I warn you—the city makes Cyrodiil seem like a mid-day wallow in a salt-meadow swamp. There are things here that would rattle Hist roots. Steel yourself.
The Rat hopes you find the arena fighters before the Daedra make them fight again. \n\nThey need poultices or the fights won't even be interesting to watch, and that's really what the Rat cares about.
That was some tale he told. The Dark Elf will probably want to get paid for his efforts.
Well, no matter where the Fist resides, my reputation will definitely increase as news of this spreads.\n\nThank you for your assistance, my friend.
Well, I'll be damned. I remember you! You helped Darien and me, back in Camlorn.\n\nIf you're involved in the commander's plan, I feel more confident already!
"Stand back and stay out of the way, Elf!" They actually said that to me!\n\nWe're surrounded by death and destruction and they're worried that an outsider might show them up! They can take their pride and … sorry, sorry. I'm a little stressed.
I'm glad I was able to help us get out of there, but I wish Gahar was still with us.
Leave me to mourn my husband.
<The cultist appears lost in thought.>
You go warn the king. Don't worry, I'll keep the high priestess safe. You can count on me.
Your general was telling you to keep an eye out for me, right? Here I am.
Well, at least the ambassador is safe and sound. I wonder if I can find a ship going back to Wayrest in the Orc city? I could even work for my passage, if they need an able body.
We have to rendezvous with the rest of our clan, those who escaped the attack on the stronghold. Then we'll send out messengers and shine torches in every dark corner until we have the answers you seek.\n\nMay Malacath guide our blades!
Decided to take me up on that offer of a drink? Good! I don't mind drinking alone, but I could use the company.\n\nBesides, Howler just gets mean when he's had a few mugs of ale.
Thank you for the invitation. The wedding was exceptional, if you put aside <<1>>'s capture by the Iron Wheel.
I informed the others about the wedding. We shouldn't blame ourselves for what happened.\n\n<<1>> told us to leave. We all understand that.
Empty. All that for nothing.\n\nNo, that's wrong. There might be a trail that leads us to the dowry. We just need to look around.
I know how <<1>> survived Malooc's Path.
What sights one sees if one simply opens his eyes and looks around.\n\nPull up a chair and let us while away the time with a strong and tasty beverage.
Even far from the sands of Alik'r, I always find comfort in a place of worship.
With the dowry returned, the Iron Wheel should soon leave Hew's Bane.\n\nDo you suppose they'll be off to threaten all the thieves in Taneth?
Tell me, Assassin, what did you see?
You look rather well … equipped. Your weapons, of course. Don't want to get booted from an establishment for using the wrong words again.\n\nAre you here about my notice? If that's the case, you're the first suitable candidate to approach me.
Not to be rude, but I have so much to do. Perhaps we could talk later.
Mermaids … but now to business, yes?\n\nRaz thinks we should gather the killer's targets. Put them all in one location and set a trap. See if the Beautiful Darkness over there agrees or if she has a better idea.
They could have had the decency to leave us a ladder or something. Never trust a crazy spider-cultist to have your best interests in mind.
At this point, I'm not looking for a cure. These waters make you insane. Muttering this "Shada this" and "Shada that" nonsense. Not to mention trying to rip out your throat.\n\nDo what you have to do and just get any survivors out of there.
Strange. I've seen these ruins jutting from the waters before. They always seemed so … ordinary. \n\nBut now they're practically humming with energy. And I sense … what is that … my gods, yes! It's some kind of entrance.
Any news about our missing guards? We're counting on you to see this through for us.
You're going into the Valley of Scars? You're certainly braver than I am.
I think it's working. One more strong assertion and that should do it!
Well, that was certainly the oddest experience I've ever had. Not the most terrifying, of course, but certainly the oddest.\n\nIf you think this was bad, I have a word of advice. Never enter a temple of Mehrunes Dagon without a proper sacrifice.
Ah, it is nice to see you, my friend. I confess, I get a bit lonesome.\n\nI made arrangements for my Eoki to be in a better situation, well treated. I know he is deeply angry with me, but I have hopes of making him happy again soon.
Why does the Hist drop so much mud in my clear waters?\n\nCareful with that one, stranger. There's something dangerous about that Naryu, but I can't wrap my tail around it.
My egg-sister told me that discount voyage was too good to be true. But did I listen? No. I wanted to see the land of the Dark Elves.\n\nDense as a log, as my egg-brother used to say ….
We're doing the right thing? A life given willingly for the greater good … it's the logical solution, isn't it?
Provost Varuni seems eager to speak with you. Go on, then.
You know, this has only been mildly terrifying and I've enjoyed our time together. Maybe I should start taking pledges again myself.
I don't regret coming here. Thanks to us, this plague has been stopped. We've saved countless lives today, my friend.\n\nStill, I can't help but wish our adventure ended under different circumstances.
Greetings. This partition governs All-Axle operations and gate controls. How can I assist you?
Please submit your questions to the deceased resident directly. All archival data related to your query will feed through the deceased resident via vocal emulation. \n\nMay Sotha Sil bless your many labors.
Okay, deep breaths—oh, bad idea! The smell's bringing it all back again. Really hope I can get through the meal ….
My followers murdered. My shrine desecrated. The other Princes, this so-called triad, they must answer for these insults.\n\nBut I sense a question in your mind. Speak, mortal! Ask what you will of the Prince of Light!
Did that mage really plan to unmask us? Why in Mara's name would she do such a thing? We've all worked so hard for this day!
That was it? I don't feel cured at all. I feel the same. I'm confused.
The Dragon was my prize. Stolen from me now, like my friends, my peace, and my free will. Destroy Orryn and let me lie.
These words of power, they aren't meant for mortal eyes.\n\nAs an earl in the Court of Bedlam, believe me when I say that Leythen isn't being totally honest with you.
I don't like any of this. Lost memories, deals with Daedric Princes … nothing about this feels right.\n\nAnd Iachesis. I've never seen him like this before. I actually think he might be … afraid.
I must get back to work now. Every moment that my cousin remains sequestered is another moment where I must perform the work of two people. Good travels, wayfarer.
The Sapiarchs recognize your bravery on our behalf in Lillandril and within the Crystal Tower.\n\nBut there is nothing you can say that will alter our thinking on this matter.
The High Magistrate watches us the way a gryphon scrutinizes coral crabs at meal time. I do not wish to appear idle before her and neither should you.\n\nLet's conclude our business and be done with this.
You should make haste to Artaeum. Those books need to be returned to their master's pit. The sooner, the better.\n\nI will be here nursing these exquisite beverages if you have any questions. May the Old Ways guide your path.
I've never seen Curtaros look so serious. It's making me nervous, if I'm honest.
I should be reclining on my lounge with a quarter-millennium aged port and Eustasia nestled in my bosom. But no, Durell insisted we take a stroll along the beach.
I have to keep working, else I'll never become a Sapiarch. If you'll excuse me.
It's going to be a long time before I can look at my own reflection, that's for sure.
If you've got Gjadil's treasure, it's best to inform Igeke. She's quite the brute if she doesn't get her way.
Is it …? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Was anyone hurt? I will never forgive myself if someone ….
Yes, yes, I'm still here. Where could I go, what with your thugs watching me like horned owls regarding a branch full of tree slugs.\n\nSo, what Argonian antiquity do you want me to examine this time?
You really want to talk to me? Visitors never want to talk to the egg-tenders! Did you know that we are the only tribe that bonds with other tribes? It may not seem so from the luster of our scales, but it's true!
Did you not hear, Mateem? Fat Gixthi awaits!\n\nYou are not stalling, I hope? Do your scales wilt in fear? Well, too bad! I will not have my voh-vastei students curling their tails at the sight of a little wamasu! Bare your fangs!
How fortunate for me that someone capable finally arrived.
My sorry excuse for a manservant can't even take part in a simple Argonian ritual without one disaster or another befalling him.\n\nWorse, he didn't even get a chance to tell me what happened inside the lodge before he … changed!
I can't believe you got him to agree. Thank you, friend! It's good to see someone with a sense of justice in these swamps.
If you're here for information on the Ebonheart Pact's war effort, speak to <<1>>. She's recruiting new members at their kiosk just to the south of the docks.
May Jone and Jode shine upon you, walker.
Hello? Is someone there? I appear to be back in my head. Well, my other head. The other head. This is so confusing!\n\nAh, wait, wait. Things are becoming clearer now. Ah, yes, well there you are! So good to see you again, my friend!
"A friend is the only gift that brings joy when returned," or so the Baandari saying goes. Nazdar has never had much to give besides his friendship, but he can attest it is joy he feels seeing you here again.
Yes? Any news of this one's Zinthia?
I'd prefer if we had another cohort or two at our disposal. Facing a Dragon is no small task, and a horde of them … well, that's just excessive.\n\nStill, the Cygnus Irregulars will stand with you. Whatever the outcome.
You must not have a fear of vampires to have wandered so close to this den of leeches. If you have quarrel with the Hollowfang clan, know I am not your enemy.\n\nIn fact, I could use some of that bravery right now.
You'll want to find another place to rest your feet, stranger. The Stitches are about to burst. It won't be much longer before the whole place unravels, as it were.
Thank you for saving Marthine. May Peryite bless you with a parcel of plague-soaked pillows.
Everyone says the farmhands are just leaving, but why haven't any of them said farewell? Why do they leave their possessions behind?\n\nThere's something in the sugarcane. Shazari knows it.
Ziss on those poaching shaveskins! Tamanat will not let this ranch burn!
You're going to help my sister save Vijari? You are a kind one, walker. Khenarthi keep the wind at your backs.
My dearest friend, you must take your place alongside the rest of the Dragonguard. The ceremony cannot begin until all of those I wish to honor are accounted for.
Could the Horn of Ja'darri truly be a gift from a Dragon? Vahlokzin said it was a Dragon's horn, willingly given … but for what purpose?\n\nAh, well. Perhaps I'll learn more in due course.
Happy hunting! Za'ji will see you back at the sanctum.
This one has worked his paws raw plucking weevils and slugs from his precious vegetables and yet every hour he finds more. Never has he seen so many bugs trying to spoil his crop!
Hail, O warrior. \n\nBlademaster Sai Sahan requests your presence at the Abbey of Blades.
You have done great service to Skyrim, my friend. The Skald-King is in your debt.\n\nFor now, let me enjoy the nearly complete comforts of my palace. One day, perhaps, the place will actually be finished.
There's something I'd like to say, before we begin.
The Skald-King welcomed to the Blue Palace with open arms. Svargrim would be spinning in his grave, if he had one.
I wouldn't go toward Karthwatch, traveler. Not now, maybe never again. Nothing left there except horrors.
Rigurt knows diplomacy is not the smoothest road, but this one was almost too bumpy, even for him! \n\nEither way, Rigurt could not have done this without your help, friend.
I understand their fear, but I don't know how to get through to them. How are we supposed to assure them that they're safe when they're all riled up about spirits and ghosts?
Word of warning? Don't wander around the outskirts of Morthal if you can avoid it. Something evil stalks the hills, make no mistake.
I'll search the lair for more trophies. Holding my brother's ring again feels like it validates him. His life. Everyone who lost someone should feel this closure.\n\nI'll send word to Eyfja and Hautgerd. If you ever come near the farm again, stop by.
You were there, weren't you? With Princess Svana? You're the one who killed Svargrim and stopped the harrowstorm?\n\nThank Kyne you came to Western Skyrim!
Mining will resume when the creatures have been cleared out of the caves. I hope that Chief Urzikh's mercy will help her and Mazog find a way to work together.
Well, that went smoother than I expected. It certainly took long enough, but I suppose the end result is worth it.\n\nStill, the sooner we leave this place, the better. I do not enjoy time away from my clan holdings.
Vandacia … a high priest of Mehrunes Dagon. Has he been a Daedric cultist all these years?\n\nI failed to see the signs and now the councilors, they're all dead … Faleria, Sophus, Abor, and Jirich.
I refuse to let them sacrifice the remaining Ambitions. Somehow, I'm able to read this accursed book. Just keep Vandacia busy long enough for me to figure out these rituals and incantations.
It was nice, you know? But I'm sorry this caused so much trouble.
The Chamber of Legates appreciates your help in this matter, but this one wishes she knew why these tragedies plague us. The Elder Council's past has come back to haunt us, or so it seems to Tebeza-ko.
That was kind of exciting! I've never been to any part of Oblivion before. A lot of it felt familiar though. Like places I've seen in my dreams lately.\n\nAnyway, thanks to everything we learned, I know exactly what needs to happen next.
The tricky shinies have been destroyed! But one remains! It stands in the room where those peasant cultists attempt to open their gate. A few members of the Court are still trapped there, including myself!\n\nYou must disrupt their ritual to free us.
Thanks again for getting me out of there. Shame Mirri's brother wasn't so fortunate, but I'm sure you did all you could. A damn lot more than I managed.
You heard the commander. The kitchen is inside the headquarters building, right over there.
Clairene is a stranger to me, of course, but part of me feels like I know her, somehow. She said I favored my—our?—father. I've always wondered about that.
Bang … bang … bang … goes my hammer. Why, yes … I am strong ….
I don't know if the Imperials will truly be willing to help us, especially after finding out one of our own is responsible … but it is our only option.
Greetings, adventurer. Keshu the Black Fin wishes you to attend a celebration in honor of our victory over the forces of Mehrunes Dagon. Can I tell her that you will come?
Argh, my age is showing. Don't worry, I'll live. It'll take some effort to mend though.\n\nI'm glad that abomination didn't leave you too much worse for wear.
Fluster fume plants grow nearby. Southeast, in the caves of Camp Gushnukbur. As for the tincture of befuddlement, I believe Aurien the alchemist may have one at the outpost south of Bramblebreach.\n\nReturn here when you have acquired both.
There is no time to waste, little mortal! We must stop Sombren. Go! I will follow you inside.
We can't leave the Anchorite in Valkynaz Nokvroz's hands. That would be a very bad idea. He can use her blood to create devastatingly powerful Incarnates, abominations even I could not stand against.\n\nWe must assault his fortress—Ardent Hope.
A lifetime of study. All my aspirations. Yet, I end up here, in a pit.\n\nNot fitting at all. Just not fair.
Lyranth the Foolkiller wishes to speak to you … although what need she sees for discussion is beyond me. We should move against Annihilarch's Summit at once. My missing Kyn may be there.
The citizens of Fargrave hail you as a hero, mortal. Savor your triumph. It is from moments such as these that legends are born.\n\nLet us return to Lyranth. But … not too swiftly.
Well, this little development should help paint myself in a better light. Being abducted is embarrassing. Being abducted by gryphons? That's an adventure.
Can't you see I'm distraught? My guard was attacked! Now who will protect me while I finish my business in the Shambles?
I can't believe you beat Mehrunes Dagon. I knew you were capable after you helped Bakh and I in the Sever, but I had no idea just how capable.\n\nWe came to Nirn hoping it might help me manage my symptoms. Thanks for making it a safe place to land.
Quite the fete. And like all great celebrations, it's full of uninteresting people.\n\nPresent company excluded, of course.
The tiny, sharp-eared mortal irreparably damaged my servant. I demand restitution!
Well, pity about the tourney and all. I had planned to buy some new armor if I won.
Cruel but fair. The dockmaster deserves whatever the Order has in store for him.\n\nLet's get all this information back to Lady Arabelle. I'll see you at the manor.
You've got Rigurt's scepter of office? Please give it to him. Before he thinks of some other way to show his appreciation for the cultures of other lands.
You're a new face! Must be here about the notice, am I right? Course I'm right! If you need work and aren't too concerned about the risks, then we should talk. \n\nI assure you, I'm a fully sanctioned representative of the Gonfalon Bay authorities.
You can use the dinghy there to ferry your party to the flotilla's flagship, the Lofte Empyrean.\n\nReport to Purser Ashcroft and she'll see that you're accounted for.
Oh, it's Isobel's friend. Hullo friend, hullo Isobel. \n\nIf you're looking for her, Aurelia is Gonfalon Bay … I mean, very much gone away.
I'd rather meet the rest of the enemy on a field of our choosing. Let's make our stand in Memorial Hall.
I can't believe Razhamad would put all of this on a player like you. That gaming hall is as good as ours.
Greetings, sera. I apologize for Brahgas's atrocious manners. We haven't had time to train him properly yet.\n\nNow then. The final match. You appear to have Razhamad's complete confidence—he wouldn't have made this foolish bet otherwise.
Play someone at your rank? Not a chance.
It is done, hunter. I am not accustomed to working alongside a partner. But you have my thanks.\n\nAt last, the souls stolen by the Pale Worm can rest in peace.
As far as I know, we have nothing to discuss, mercenary. You've been paid for your efforts thus far, and I am not inclined to repeat praise.\n\nMy son, however, does wish to discuss something with you. Talk to him.
Niraya tells me you saved her from the Dreadsails at Castle Tonnere. And that you recovered the sacred seed of our circle. Is this true?
I understand the pattern of what occurred. Druid Laurel was scouting. Came upon these Firesong druids. They fought. She was overpowered. Taken away.\n\nThe leaves tremble for her. So do I.
Sir Stefan still wants to talk to you, druid-kin. And I have a few last preparations to make before we're ready to head to the city.
Tell your … extremely handsome friend that Ellorien is taken. Not that she'd be interested in the likes of him anyway.\n\nThere is something about him, though. And you're very gorgeous. Maybe you'd both like to stay awhile?
Well, I'll be. I heard that you came back to town with a bag full of critters for Juline. And nary a bite mark on you, too! You made out better than I did.\n\nHope she paid you well for your trouble.
Glad I caught you, sailor. Sir Stefan has some pretty urgent business to discuss with you. I caught him just on his way out of the city. He was hoping to meet up with you, but I suppose if you're here, it means you didn't cross paths.
Lady Juline sent word that you returned with the radiant cores. Top-notch work! I'll study them once they've cooled down a little. Don't need to burn a hole through my workbench.
Ho, sailor! You're harder to pin down than a sail in a windstorm. Sir Stefan wants to see you.
I suppose I should offer my congratulations. Not only did you help Quen and me, but I understand you calmed the volcano. Nicely done! Maybe next you could do something about mudcrabs. I really despise the shells and those weird eye stalks.
Hero of the Systres! We're still making repairs after that unfortunate incident at the last banquet, but Duchess Elea said to direct you to the knight commander's office in the knight's wing were you to return.\n\nI'm sure she'll be happy to see you.
Please. You must get us out of here. There's a key somewhere. \n\nLook for the first mate—she may be somewhere outside the slavers' camp.\n\nPlease help us.
It worked! Let us head back at Telenger's camp so we can bring him the good news!\n\n...I hope that Meliara does not try to take credit for our achievements.
Ironically, it was in our fight against the hideous Goblins that we came to love the desert and its simple beauty.\n\nNow you must face the proud Orc warriors of ancient Orsinium. The fight for the Orc city proved to be one of our greatest trials.
If you decide to go after the Grinder, just don't let him get the drop on you.\n\nThat would be the last mistake you'd ever make. Good luck out there.
You spoke with General Thoda? Please tell us, tell the Duchess what he said.
Thanks for helping the Duke. I'm glad I don't have to have his death on my conscience.
Will someone just let me know whether or not we're going to get paid for this? I could really use the gold.
I don't remember inviting you aboard. Make your business quick, or you'll be picking seaweed out of your teeth.
This beautiful woman from the Mages Guild just arrived. Says she knows you! You can introduce me later.\n\nI was right about the amulets, though, wasn't I?
Well, we've been through quite a bit together, haven't we? \n\nI think I like you. You're fun! Stop by and visit if you're ever in the neighborhood!
You have a triumphant look about you. Spit it out, have you the key or not?
Speak to Lorelia and listen to her wisdom.
Look for the Bloodthorn envoy in the central part of the ruins.\n\nBe careful though. Once he falls, disguise or not, they'll come after you with everything they have. Only your wits and your weapons will get you out of there in one piece.
Mother is hungry, but it makes me a little sick to watch her eat.\n\nAre you looking for the Captain? They dragged her into the cave. The Bad One is going to do terrible things to her.
Luck to you. I'll see if we can hold this line in case you return … I mean, until you return.
Oh, great. This is all I need.
We're in the heart of the cave, friend. Now is the time to strike.\n\nWhat do you say? Think we're mighty enough to take on the Goblin Warlord and his spider queen?
It looks like the rats are moving in.\n\nI appreciate your help in this. Now no one will get hurt.
Remember, just taking the resonators isn't enough. You also need to disable the repair stations.
Once she has grown bored with her Altmer lover, she'll discard him for another. \n\nAnd like a man-eating beast, she has grown a taste for mortal attentions.
Thanks for returning my crystal. You have no idea how much that thing is worth. Certainly more than you'll ever earn in your life.
Welcome to the Fighters Guild! You look like the capable sort. Why have you come? Are you here to answer the Guildmaster's challenge?
Did you talk to Mavos?
You radiate an aura of power. Does this mean you have the books?
I'll meet you at the tavern in Riften as soon as I can, my new friend.
You're Kyne-sent, traveler. Please.
Oh, my poor Tavo! What am I going to do without him?
I can't thank you enough for saving me. I'm no milk drinker, but those bandits could have sent me to Sovngarde with the flick of a wrist.
I'll be honest, adept. I can barely stand to look at you. Sending an intelligent woman like Valaste off with that creature. But … I feel honor bound to offer you a final gift.
I know, I know. You're not going to be yourself again until we find your <<1>>, but don't go back out there!
What a bloody, tragic business!
Were the Orcthane's agents dealt with?
I'm sure Thane Mera will appreciate your assistance. And your discretion.
My bonds are broken! I'm free of that vermin-infested cave. Now to hunt down more of those damned cultists.
Please, help. The Drublog ….
No, it can't end like this! He promised!
The handfast ritual is but one of the many ceremonies for this wedding.\n\nLook around, my friend. Without you, this joyous celebration could not be possible.
The nightmare begins again. You should have left sooner. Now you're trapped here with us, to the bitter end.
Companions, workers, find them and save them. Who am I forgetting? Oh, right. Did I mention how grateful my sister Kireth will be to see your face?
Nimalten reminds me of Bleakrock. All these good people, oblivious to danger. If only we could have protected my family. \n\nHave you learned anything?
Four years. I've been at this party for four years. The Argonian body wasn't meant to take this kind of abuse. But every time I try to leave, someone shoves a bottle at me. And here I stay.
That was some display. Ysgramor's strength!
Not bad, not bad. Not that impressive, either.\n\nIf you really want to prove yourself—
Seek out the Cultist Summoner atop the dais. The evil flows from there.
I never should have left. Nothing like good solid ground.
Quickly, take the side tunnel to return to the entrance!
You arrived just in time.
Let's show these Bloodthorn cultists what for!
If you're looking for work, there's better to be had elsewhere. The forge is suited for the lesser races, particularly those cats. \n\nAlmost hate to see the Bosmer work the forge. Mer should stick by mer.
You look to be young and able. Please say you'll help.\n\nThe Nurin farm has been burned down and Mister Nurin has disappeared. It's very serious.
We have nothing to discuss. I'll meet you below.
The traitors lost their fight once you killed <<1>>. I'd rather hang the lot of them, but <<2>> said some were coerced into it.\n\nEven so, they'll need some kind of punishment.
You don't belong here.
Shame about Captain Helane. I hear even a touch of that poison gives you the runs for years, though. That'll keep me grinning.
Please … you have to help. They're trapped. There's no help coming, and they don't know it.
Thank you for helping <<1>> find me.
The man is a pig. But then, aren't they all?
Thank you. You have made a wise decision. The Bright Moons will sing your name for this.
The holy waters of Do'Krin have kept the Claw safe for years. I pray they keep you safe as well.
This place is pretty impressive.
Hallowed, thank you for dispatching that treacherous Urcelmo. I … have to admit, I'm going to make jokes at his expense for years off this.
Quick work. Word spreads that I have a new collector. I've already gotten back some of the coin I was owed.
Hurry! Head into the tunnel and find our leader. She'll explain the plan to you.
What a day.
Ha! You should've seen Garnikh's face when you won that duel!
Do not hesitate. This is the only way the Keeper oath is fulfilled and Tamriel remains safe.
<The statue holds the Gem of Preservation.>
The Mane still lives. I trust you have a good reason for this, my friend?
I don't know how much the Maormer are willing to listen to reason. But I must try, for the sake of <<1>>.
Welcome back to the Guildhall. There is much knowledge buried beneath the sands of Alik'r. Have you found any to share?
Please return quickly with the tools. If I can't trade them for medicine, this one's father will die.
Only the dead and the desperate end up in this part of the desert. You appear to be neither, so you must be a very brave soul. \n\nDo you intend to enter the cursed grounds, the Tears of the Dishonored?
Mother said we should pray at the shrines, see more of her past. Come, Hallowed. Let's do it.
That Bosmer we … captured mentioned a matriarch named Selene.
Told you I'd make it back, didn't I? Not going to let something like a little gutwound stop me. No way.
Honor and praise, my friend. Do you have the Staff of Magnus?
I thank you. If you are braving the cellars further, I would ask again for your help. On behalf of all my people.
These disappearances have the Justice on blade's edge. Seek him out if you have any information to impart.
I hope to save enough gold to make the journey to Sentinel, but it's hard to come by in this stingy Crown village. They cling to their wealth like a goat kid to its nanny's teat.
Ranneth untied me? That means Pircalmo is safe, right? He did nothing wrong?
Hurry! If you take too long, these bandits will kill me.
The Withered Hand rallies more dead to its banner with each passing day, and still these fools feud. Crowns and Forebears taste the same to vultures.
Welcome. What brings you to <<c:1>>?
I've seen better.\n\nGo on then, ask what you will.
Do not tell Meridia, but Mezha-dro should have joined Fighters Guild. At least then fighting all these Dremora would pay something.
By Jone and Jode, I wasn't sure we'd make it out of that one, but you never cease to impress. Things are always exciting when you're around, it seems.
Tava curse these twisted legs! I almost reached him in time. \n\nI wasn't fast enough.
We have to keep the Sea Vipers out of <<1>>. We must hurry.
Did you find her? Please tell me you did … or at least, that you didn't lose the flute. It's the only memory of her I have.
I'm safe. I'm safe. They can't hurt me here.
Red Mountain Ash, how Thalara longs for it. Seek the tuffs around Lake Rumare. Gather ash for Thalara, and rewards will be yours!\n\nBeware of other seekers. They will steal what you've gathered.
I can't believe Calastil would stoop so low as to steal my heraldic cane just to score a few favors with the queen in my absence!
Red Mountain Ash is what I need. And you're just the sort who can bring it to me. Harvest it from the tuff around Lake Rumare.\n\nIf you see anyone else harvesting ash, steal theirs before they steal yours!
Good luck with your trial. I like you. I rather hope you survive.
My lord Varen has more to say to you.
You'd better speak to Varen. I think we've given them all something to think about.
I owe you my life. My Lord calls you Vestige? A strange name. Is it true your soul was taken from you?
The ritual is prepared. Wyress Rashan assured me that you'd have the heart.\n\nAssuming you do, tell Rashan, and we can get on with it. We don't want the forest to suffer a moment longer than it has to.
Welcome back to the guildhall, my friend. \n\nThe history of Bangkorai is rich in lurid and bloody events. Have you brought us any regional books or journals?
The captain will soon realize the right decision was made.
Tell the most honorable guard how you heroically drew your weapon before chasing after that mangy cur!
We dislodged House Montclair from its nest. The upper city is ours and Shornhelm is free.
<<1>> said you're headed off to kill more bandits. Keep good count, all right? I bet him it would be less than a dozen.
I've half a mind to go after Nedras. What in Tamriel possessed him to leave me like this?
The mine may be lost, but with these notes I can at least continue my research. Thank you.
It's strange to think that Najan and I will never speak again, but he deserves it. He deserves worse.
Thank you. Take this ice rune. Captain Gemelle gave it to me to freeze the webs trapping the others. It should make them brittle enough for our soldiers to break free.
I thought for a minute he would start making sense now … but I was wrong.
<Scouting mission notices and reports are posted to this board.>
These people will never forget what you've done for them. And neither will I.
I don't care who you are, if you can't carry my luggage you're useless to me!
You must be ….\n\nYou must be … you must be … incredibly stupid to come talk to me.
The Empress of Bone does not wish to speak with you.
Praise the Eight! Did you kick that stupid thug's teeth in? I don't know what was worse—being held hostage or smelling that ruffian's breath!\n\nWhat about the robbery, though? Did you stop them or did they get away with the jewels?
Don't feel bad. I knew Julien was a hopeless case. A man who's sick in love is a sad man indeed. \n\nI feel sorry for him, really. Enlisting would have probably helped set him straight.
I hope Nilyne can put those healing herbs to good use.
Traveler. How goes your survey of Zabamat? Have you found Hightide Hollow, as yet?
I'm rather fond of Estre. High Kinlady Estre, that is. So noble, just, and Altmer through and through. She'll keep us strong.
It must have been gruesome work, but thanks again for dealing with the Scaled Court in Skyreach Hold. I'm sure you saved many lives.\n\nI only hope the Scaled Court doesn't return to try again. That would be disastrous.
<Enchanting writs are posted to this section of the board.>
I will be fine in a moment. Hogondar can fall on his sword if he gets bored.
Arushna has been kind enough to capture a wild durzog for me to tame.\n\nDid you find the whistle?
Thank you so much for agreeing to help. Oh, I hope they're all right.
Please, you need to check the coffer. My hands are shaking too much.
Chief.\n\nUh, is there anything you need? I can get the echatere back in their pens … or out of their pens. Whatever you need.
Take your time to study the scrolls and choose carefully. Only one blessing per overseer, you know.
No, I have no idea what it means. Hey, I'm just the messenger!
Get to the temple and help Eveli and Solgra. Then find the way into the moot.
So. You're making a stupid face. I'm assuming you have questions?\n\nSorry. It's not a stupid face. It's just—never mind. I have … difficulties.
Ah, the handsome Rigurt has chosen you to be his champion? I approve. What a rare and prestigious honor, to be selected to participate in the sacred rites of Orc love!\n\nSo tell me, what would you like to know?
You've done well. I think, on behalf of my master here, I may begin to be cautiously optimistic.
Thank the Eight, you've made it. Barely got past the Daedra myself, but this place seems safe enough for now.
So. You're making a stupid face. I'm assuming you have questions?\n\nSorry. It's not a stupid face. It's just—never mind. I have … difficulties.
Never liked funerals, never will.
Ah, my favorite problem-handler has returned! Have you come to see what you accomplished? Thanks to you, the clan chiefs have gathered to hear what I have to say.\n\nThis is going to be a moot that all of Wrothgar won't soon forget!
New-Brother! Welcome! Welcome! If there's anything you need, anything at all, you come to me, yes?
You don't belong here, and you absolutely shouldn't be speaking with me.
I've never seen <<1>> this happy. And we do have need of a good forger.\n\nIf he helps us get <<2>> in hand, I'll make him an honorary member.
My father, dead? Before that, together with <<1>>?\n\nPlease, see what she has to say. I need a moment to think.
Find <<1>> in <<c:2>>. And hurry—the wedding is very soon.
Last I saw <<1>>, she was pacing about in <<c:2>>. Going to put a furrow in the floor if she isn't careful.
My lady made an amulet like that from one of my scales, too.
Go on, Assassin. We both have things we need to do.
You want tickets, talk to the front counter. You want a refund, go jump in the sea. All sales are final.
You stink like death, strange one. Just what are you? No, better not to tell me. If the Shadowscale trusts you, then so will I. For now.
What is your decision? We need your help.
Thanks again for everything you've done. I'll take some time with the amulet to see if it could be of further use to us.\n\nIf you're looking for other ways to aid us, Hara might have some suggestions on where to go.
It's about time! We sent a runner to Belkarth days ago!\n\nWait—you're not the reinforcements we requested, are you? Damn it.
Many believe the Nedes were barely more than barbarians, but ruins like this prove otherwise. Don't underestimate their cleverness. Look for a pattern if you can, and consider the possibility that the lock was designed to be impossible to open alone.
Blessings of the Divines upon you. I will not forget the selfless aid you have given today—and at no small risk to yourself. \n\nShould the time come when that dread creature stirs again, we will be ready. Until then, safe journey to you.
Not now! I want to watch this.
Lord Vivec protect me! That was Azura, the Queen of the Night Sky! And you—she spoke directly to you, outlander!\n\nI'm surprised the Daedric Prince would risk Lord Vivec's wrath to proclaim a prophecy, but she did say you were here to aid us.
I wonder what other delicacies the Dark Elves make? You'd think that after all these years at the side of the great Narsis Dren I would know more about his culture. I suppose he's more interested in the ancient past than in talking about the present.
It's done? Thank you, sera. Not many people would take a life for their friends. At least I hope we're friends. The House … it makes it difficult to tell sometimes.\n\nArith and I spoke just moments ago. Things should move quickly.
Why are you still here, bothering me, n'wah?
I thank you for your aid. Fewer than ever are willing to aid their elders in these troubled times, though I suppose the distance with my children is my fault, not theirs.
Are you here about our little … pest problem?
That's the atelier behind me. Not only is this the workshop where Sotha Sil experimented with divine energy, it also houses one of the reservoirs that can be used to power the entire city—a reservoir currently filled with Vivec's energy.
I'm finally at ease now that we're free of the marshal's tyranny.
Did you not hear me, shadow-weaver? My sister is coming, and when she gets here, she will make a meal of you!
There's nothing to be done for these poor apprentices. The inductor has drained every drop of life from their bodies.\n\nBut what of Lector Naril? He cloaks his evil in good intentions.
I think we're done here, don't you? Let's get back to the surface. I'm sure Raynor's paced a hole in Varuni's floor by now.
Please, unless you have gold to spare or something other than paste to eat, just leave me alone.
Vile told me to find the mortal flea that continues to pester him and deliver a message. He's terrible with mortal names, but I immediately thought of you. Glad to see that my intuition's as sharp as ever!\n\nOh, yeah. I've got a message for you.
Thank you for accepting my offer. I'd travel to the hulkynd myself, but the wilderness is no place for an artist. Besides, they may be more willing to talk to a newcomer such as yourself. The hulkynd are well known for being distrustful.
Your companion wishes to speak. We will wait.
I believe we toured the southern, northern, and central arbors. Yes, that sounds right. There should be three bottles, all with the Russafeld seal.\n\nNow, you go do that. I'm going to lie down. For just a minute.
I've spent so many years here, with such terrible things happening right under my nose. Maybe it is time for me to move on.
I can't believe Battlereeve Pandermalion went back in there. He sacrificed himself to save us all. I'm honored to have known him.
Hey, scaleless one. I have a message for you. From Kassandra. She wants to see you in her office in Lilmoth right away.
Can you hear me? This is just …. Please, if you can hear me, make your way toward the light, or the vortex, or whatever it is you're supposed to examine.
Well, now. Looks like someone put you through a night at the alehouse in the span of a minute. Try not to choke on your own vomit before finding the Remnant.
This one thinks the little metal rat would make a good toy for her Senche-cousin's cub. Perhaps she will take one as part of her payment.
All things crumble, all things break. And so too do all things grow again.
You'll find no Sanctuary in this swamp, sister. Murkmire is where the Dread Father takes his meals.
A queen should not rush into danger! It is unseemly! This one should be at her side to keep her safe.\n\nNala-do will follow orders, though. We must make our way through the crypts and into the palace before Khamira gets into too much trouble, yes?
Welcome, walker. You have come to show our warriors how to fight, yes?
Saviwa is grateful to you for helping his ancestor's spirit find peace. Saviwa would be even more grateful to you if you helped him get a jug of plum brandy.
Why would you come to Orcrest when everyone here is dead or dying?
Be careful. Magic is a tricky business, especially in Tharn's hands.
I think you'll find our new friend far more cooperative now.
I'll meet you at the fortress entrance. And before you ask, no. You cannot ride me there.
That Dragon took one look at you and just gave up! You must be some sort of five-claw.
My skin … it's no longer blue. And … my heart! I can feel it beating again! By all the gods, I'm alive! \n\nWhatever you and Mjolen cast on me, it broke the curse. I feel heat course through my veins for the first time in years.
Are you mad? Don't step foot anywhere near that farm. Those … bone wolves will rip you apart limb from limb! They turned everyone there into zombies.
I hope our two ghost hunters won't judge me too harshly for being a thorn in their side. Without them looking into this, Urlvar would never have been exposed. I gave them a hard time, but they never gave up on Dusktown.\n\nI owe them.
The swordthane gathered people in the Hall of the Dead. Go check on them while I pull myself together. This whole ordeal has been a lot more strenuous than I'm accustomed to.\n\nThen I'll get to work on the elixir and a cure for the harrowed.
That man infuriates me so much I could incinerate him with a fire summoning, then dump his ashes into a resurrection pot just so I could do it again! \n\nI married the damn fool, so I suppose I have no one to blame but myself.
Curse him! We'll never be able to catch him like this!\n\nHow do we apprehend a man who can vanish into thin air right before our eyes?
You look sturdy enough. Vampires and Sea Giants have invaded the island of Kyne's Aegis. We need all the willing warriors we can find to repel the attack!
I need a moment to catch my breath.
Things like the Shademother make me hope that my next subject for research turns out to be pure fiction.
I'll find Scholar Diel's camp straightaway. I'm in your debt. If I can do anything to aid you, all you have to do is ask.
Talk to Verandis before we start poking around that castle. Place looks creepy.
<<<1>> thumps her foot once and stares at the next hill.>
Don't think it's just Verandis I expect to visit. It'd be nice bumping into you somewhere other than a moldy cavern once in a while.\n\nCastle Ravenwatch is always open to you. It's not like we have a shortage of guest rooms.
Feh, adventurers. Come and go as you please. Keep three kings and a jarl biding on their thumbs in a crowded hall. Suppose you've earned that right, rover!\n\nNear everybody in this room wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
Good to see you alive and well. It's good to see everyone alive and well! I don't know to what gods we should be giving our thanks, but I wager we all owe you a good portion.
I never expected Master Pythis to betray the Order. He was one of the best. If we hadn't intervened when we did, what kind of chaos would he have wrought?\n\nBut, at least the device is secure now. The Psijics will ensure it stays that way.
I knew Eslyn might prickle at the idea of the handfasting, but to go through all of this only to accomplish nothing? Foolish. And I've lost face in front of both the chief-of-chiefs and Vateshran Barth.
All these strangers lurking around the Reach. They bring chaos into our home! \n\nNone of these dogs would stand tall in a fight against true Reach warriors.
Those were good chains you broke. I should know, I made them. But better broken than binding me.\n\nI don't hear a battle going on—so, I'm guessing you didn't come with a battalion at your back.
I'll do whatever you say. Just get me out of here!
Leave me alone. Can't you see that I'm in mourning?
You did well to bring these twins to Gideon. I will make sure that they are well protected.\n\nIs it true, though? What Eveli told me? These are the Ambitions you sought?
Ah! Careful! You—you might have scared the mare. Who are you? What do you want?
What's the big deal? This is the seventh time I tried running away in three years. Why are they all gawping at me like they're afraid to blink?
Kaoc! I can already smell them on you. I do not even need to ask.\n\nPut them right up to Otumi-Ra's nose. Let him get a big old whiff. Hopefully that snaps him right out.
These beasts passing as Argonians stumbled into some powerful magic here. And of course, their only thought is thievery. Gah!\n\nGo, find the Binding Word. Bring it here so we can undo the only clever thing these creatures have managed.
Look what they did to her. To my mother! They nearly killed her. Killed all of us!\n\nThey won't get away with it. It may not be now, but one day I'll make these fetchers pay for what they did to us.
Thanks mightily for getting me out of there. I don't know how much longer I could've lasted.
Hail, dryskin. Not sure where your feet are taking you, but if it's to the shrine down the road, I suggest you reconsider.\n\nNisswo Somarz has had more than enough trouble with outsiders for one day.
The Anchorite's ties to the Order of the Waking Flame run even deeper than I suspected. The cataclysts were built to respond to the blood that runs through her veins.\n\nWhat else did you learn in Deadlight?
Is this a shrine to Mehrunes Dagon? I feel like I've been here before. I recognize it from one of the memory fragments … the visions … I've been having.\n\nAnd my amulet. It's warm all of a sudden. Like it's drawn to the altar. How strange.
Delightful. Another wanderer enters town seeking refuge. We just keep growing! I have no idea how we will sustain all you people.\n\nWait, are you with this Daedra? You should speak to him then. Tell him to leave. I want nothing to do with him.
Now that the dust has settled, I'm not really sure what to do with myself. I suppose we should probably check in with a few people. Word probably travels fast with something this big, but we can't count on that.
This is no time for idle talk, mortal. Our clan's enemies seek to escape our vengeance. Speak to Lyranth. Perhaps she knows where they have gone to hide.
Oh! Are you new to Fargrave or the Gleaners? It doesn't matter, you've probably never messed up as badly as I have. Maybe we can help each other.
I am heartened to see my fellow Kyn free of chains and cages. But many more were fed to the barbarous device, the Riven Cataclyst. This must not be allowed to stand.
We're finished with this filthy spider-nest. Meet me outside.
Ah, at last. I'm whole again! I can't begin to describe how unpleasant it is to be strewn across the cosmos. \n\nI think my sense of touch was underwater half the time. And my teeth feel like I've been sleeping with my mouth open.
Once again, my mistress, the Dread Lady, Lyranth the Dremora, deigns to share her infinite wisdom with a chosen mortal.\n\nWhy she continues to choose you, I have no idea. No matter, are you prepared to hear the words of the Dread Lady?
The Deadlands are never really still, but … things almost seem calm, for the moment. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me.
The mud flows where it will, my friend. As soon as I recover my strength, I will help in any way I can.\n\nI know that Prince Irnskar is still out there somewhere. We just need to find him.
I'm not sure who is happier with today's events, Aurelia or Isobel. \n\nI think our new knight is anxious to speak to you.
I'm trusting a capricious nature spirit. Wonderful. Well, talk to Audrine and get moving. Warrane and I will try to buy you some time by cleansing as much of the corruption as we can.
I am positively mortified. In all my years of diplomatic work I have never been involved in such a scene.\n\nI would be in your debt if you could convince Rigurt to never bring this up again.
Lord Bacaro may have proclaimed that this was a celebration for the alliance leaders, but everyone came out to see the hero who saved All Flags Castle. I'm impressed how fast the word got around—even if I may have had something to do with that!
Ooo. Unless you can cure this one's aching back, Halz is not feeling like talking.
So, you come to collect your reward, yes? Are you sure you don't want to try to earn something even sweeter? Even if you lose, you still win!\n\nIt is up to you, though! Kishka does not care.
Bah! You fumble about like a ja'khajiit! There is no backing out now, walker. Sit and play!
I certainly didn't expect Brahgas to make it this far, but as I said, I never underestimate my opponents.\n\nWatching the two of you play should be quite the treat. Please, take a seat. I promise, I won't make a peep.
These faceless knights—the Ascended ones, or whatever they're called—are giving the Systres a bad name, if you ask me. Someone needs to do something about them.
Each of the druid circles has their own seed, why would the Firesongs kill for ours? \n\nIt doesn't matter, Archdruid Devyric will never get his rotting hands on the Stonelore seed now. I just hope the Eldertide's seed is safe too.
I can't thank you enough for all your help, friend. Remember that the Stonelore Circle owes you a great debt. Hopefully, one day we can repay it.
Do I look like I can carry on a conversation right now?
Each night as I fall asleep I will think of what you did and the sounds they will make as they choke to death on poisoned wine.
Finally my father stops chasing the mirage! I advised him to listen to Ash'abah weeks ago. Better late than never.\n\nIf you will go speak with Marimah, I will reach out to my Ash'abah contacts as well. \n\nWe will find a way to stop the Withered Hand.
There are many heroes buried here, to be sure, but these three are the ones Ash'abah scholars are most concerned about. \n\nThey were extremely powerful in life, and scholars fear they could be extremely dangerous in death.
You thought as the disciple did, though it appears the old master does not appreciate her freedom.
And so it ends. \n\nI believe I will use you as an example in a parable, to explain true courage to novices. Yes, I believe I will.
My sister and the other women made it here. Everyone's a bit rattled and tired, but otherwise they don't seem hurt.
The generals of the Alessian army played a vital part in the Battle of the Glenumbra Moors. Their weapons, if still intact, would suffice, I think.\n\nIf you manage to get your hands on the weapons, find Sarvith. He knows what to do from there.
Knock the stuffing out of those hags.
We'll wait for your signal and then make our way out. What fun!
This is it. All our work has led to this.
Good to see you looking healthy and light on your feet, walker. Did your deliveries go smoothly?\n\nIldani takes your presence here as a good sign.
Looks like things are finally happening. We're going to take the town back.
Without your help, I would have been meat for the jackals.
It's only a matter of time before <<1>> is ours again.
Bring the <<1>>. I need it for what we must do.\n\nTrees will grow where we rest, and balance will be restored.
Help <<1>> with whatever she needs to prepare the ritual.\n\nOur lives, and perhaps the future of our people, rely on seeing this through, no matter what the cost.
Troll's blood! You've saved my life and the lives of my kind. I'll ask for your help one more time, if you'll let me.\n\nI crave revenge. We must make the Goblin Warlord and his spider queen pay for what they've done.
Like eels through seagrass, we're inside. Well done! As we speak, my troops are attacking the fort's main yard.
I still have my eye on you, even if the Farseer considers you a friend of the clan.
You say you can help? Prove it.\n\nI won't believe you until I see some results.
I was told <<1>> asked you to investigate the murders.\n\nMay you find the secrets hidden in deep waters.
One moment, soldier. This takes concentration.
You found it! Take it to <<1>>. She should still be resting nearby.
I hope <<1>> told you the plan.
Do you desire an exquisite torment? No? Then go, before I change my mind.
Strange meeting you out here in the wilds. After Davon's Watch, I hadn't expected to see you again.\n\nIf I might say it, another … minor issue has arisen.
I hear there's profits in Ebonheart.
Always good working with a guildmate. May Stendarr watch your back.
<cough> I don't have long. Is he dead?
Did I hear that right? The hero of Eastmarch? Well met, and good to have you with us!
I think I figured out why cats like us so much.\n\nIt's because we are so beautiful. And we smell good.
Under the table, just there! Did you see that? It was a Worm Cultist!
Well, at least they're all accounted for. No more dares for me.
<<1>> won't be safe until Treehenge is secure.
Why must the Worm Cult meddle in Bosmer affairs?
Have you ever thought of becoming a brewer's assistant? We could go after even more unusual ingredients.
Someone finally shut that lizard up. Great work out there, and some mighty fine shooting.
The fighting has been difficult, my friend. It's good to see you still alive.
Almost wish I could take the trials myself. It's been too many years.
Did you strike a bargain with Deros and his crew? Did they rise to the bait?
See what I have seen, traveler. See what the Divines have to show you.
That creepy advisor from Mournhold says my father's missing. How is that possible? He's the House Councilor!
I can't believe you agreed with him!
You've chosen to side with us?\n\nIt was the right decision to make from a list with no good answer. Speak to Angof. You'll see.
Don't bother my patrons. They're drinking.
Just put your frog in the basket on the end there and they'll be entered in the next race.\n\nDon't forget to feed them, now!
Destroy the relic, now! Didn't you hear the screams, as those things consumed the souls of my people?
If I get turned into an undead monster, feel free to crush my skull. Seriously. I never want to be like that.
Who's there? I didn't kill your Dominion friends. I warned them, but they didn't listen.
Lots of snakes out here. Watch your ankles.
It's done, isn't it? <<1>> is sealed inside with that monster.
I know going against Kaleen was a hard thing. It was for me as well. We have more history together than you can imagine.\n\nEven so, I'm leaving. It's time to start my own crew, sail my own ship. You, my friend, would be welcome with us anytime.
This is horrible. The spirit wasn't any help. The Great Tree can't last much longer against the vapor!
I never expected to have to do battle with Daedra! I rather enjoyed myself!
Now we must return to the Harvest Heart. There is one more thing to do before we can destroy Molag Bal's vile monstrosity.
They can't do this! We've got to get rid of them!
What I wouldn't give to be having this meeting in Skyrim. It's hot as Dragon's breath in here.
I cannot believe we are still standing here! \n\nPlease, talk to Enneh and then let me know what he says. If he doesn't know where Casnar is, then we can call the wedding off!
You look weary. Perhaps you'd care to stop here and rest? We have much to offer.
Hurry! If you take too long, these Ungodly might decide to kill me. Find those keys!
It's a pleasure to speak with another knowledge-seeker. Guildmaster Vanus will be pleased!
<<1>> is pacing around again, playing his flute. How can anyone like an instrument that makes such a high pitched sound?
Sometimes it feels like these cultists really are worms. When you slice them to pieces, you just wind up with more of them!
I'm pleased that you are still willing to work with me, Vestige. I hope to make amends for my part in all this.
Another one? Curious. What do you want?
For the love of Mara, I didn't think I'd see the end of this day. Did Captain Gaercroft, my father, send you?
I do not understand why this inn is so popular with travelers. The beds are like rocks and the mead tastes like the sweat of a dog.\n\nI will not spend one night more here than is absolutely necessary.
I've dealt with these Worm Cultists before. They use the darkest magic, and they don't fight fair. Be careful.
Good to see you again, my friend. Kazirra asked me to send her regards. Actually, she said something about the moons. You know how it goes.
<<<1>> wags his tail happily.>
Hallowed. It is good to finally put a face to all the tales I've heard.
What are you doing? Go activate the blood fountain already.
Why? Why did they have to leave us?
<<1>> believes we Covenant troops require a symbol to rally behind, but he is mistaken. \n\nThe Old Tower is occupied by an Imperial Cohort. No stolen hat will change those odds.
Priest Marnest is surprisingly more helpful than I anticipated. Comforting the refugees, performing blessings and rituals, cooking and cleaning. He even tells a pretty good story.
You have the gratitude of Sen Dres, my new friend. I'd raise a goblet of wine with you, if there was time. But there isn't.
I'm going to stay here with my brother. See what you can find in the chambers we passed through.
It's horrible they're capturing people all over the city!
Always good to speak with another knowledge-seeker. Guildmaster Vanus will be pleased!
I doubt the Listener spoke to the Keeper before making this decision. It'll be interesting to see what happens when he returns.
It is my belief that Molag Bal's minions committed a great sacrilege in defacing those statues. Even for a Daedric Prince, that is simply too far.\n\nThe gods would see him humbled, and they will strengthen our sword-arms accordingly.
I know that this is a crucial mission. Just … just make it quick, all right?
You didn't hear it from me, but Ralen Veri can set you up. He's connected to all kinds of tempting opportunities.
You're back—good. I just finished looking through some of this correspondence and …. Wait, what's that? A scroll? It looks ancient. Where did you find it?
The records you found before were invaluable, but incomplete. Through no fault of yours, of course!\n\nAre you … quite busy at the moment?
I was able to slip right past those metal monstrosities! I guess my old skills aren't as stale as I thought they were.\n\nAnd my daughter made it out, too. Thank you!
Looks like all that training my mother forced upon me paid off! I was like a breeze blowing through the ruins, like a whisper in the night. I was, if I say so myself, magnificent!\n\nYou should talk to the forge-wife. I'll just wait here for Neramo.
I don't have a lot of patience for Kurog's games. The sooner he says his peace, the sooner I can return to my own stronghold.
I'm pretty sure we're done here, New-blade. There must be some other Brother you can bother. Or maybe Elam? He probably has a contract for you by now.\n\nBit of advice—old Elam can be a grouch, but he loves it when initiates give him a hard time.
Look at those two. You wouldn't know them for assassins of the Dark Brotherhood just by looking at them, that's for sure. \n\nThanks for making sure this ended well.
All right. I'll admit it. You may … provisionally, mind you … be somewhat competent.\n\nBut don't let it go to your head.
<<1>> is the one you must convince, not me!
There's nothing to consider. The crazy Dark Elf has to die.
Can you believe it? These people … our people who drank the water … they're starting to return. They seem to be in their right minds again!
Everything you need is on Betnikh. Show me you hunt for hearth and clan, and you're welcome to join the Stonetooth Bash.
Best keep your eyes peeled in that mine. Inanius kwama are always ornery. Hlaren probably left some Iron Hounds to watch for intruders, too.\n\nI hate to say it, but Hlaren probably won't come quietly. If you need to put her down by force, so be it.
Those damned ruffians! If the Scarlet Judge hadn't arrived, I fear those bandits would have been the end of me.\n\nI appreciate your efforts as well. Thank you, stranger.
Oh, it's you. Well, I suppose any friend of Lord Vivec's can be forgiven for inadvertently pushing a famous author and explorer into a dank, dark well.\n\nJust understand that I will not be mentioning you in my next book.
Ha! I knew you weren't interested in kwama caves. One of those blackhearted magisters sent you to filch this thing, am I right?
Do you work with Traylan? Could you please tell him to look over my request again. The problems in that egg mine simply must be addressed!
Interesting … sounds like the master isn't completely happy with his dog ….\n\nThis engineering junction contains some of Sotha Sil's more powerful fabricants. They'll take care of the skaafin, but they might also try and deal with us.
Stay back. Back! I will not die like the others!
I'll write about it all, everything that we've gone through. The battles, the hardships, the … losses. Everyone shall know of what transpired here, and of your brave heroics.\n\nI can finally write my grand thesis, and I have you to thank.
Well done slaying Gascone. Sometimes justice requires a heart of brass. Varuni will learn that eventually. Perhaps sooner than she'd like.
We're done, right? Where's the key?
What a magnificent monolith! I wonder if the workings extend into the subterranean levels below us. Maybe that's where the true functioning takes place.
At last you return, and with my reagents. Come, I simply must see them. My genius is like a stallion waiting to be set free!
What are you? Some sort of saint sent to deliver me from digging through Malooc's squalor? \n\nWell, two searchers are better than one. We'll meet near the eastern exit of the Coral-Splitter Caves. Not too far from safety. Watch yourself.
By the Eight, I'll be glad when this cult is wiped clean from the face of Nirn.
He just …. But the rules state …!\n\nLook, I won't tell anyone about this if you won't. I'll say … I don't know, Lirendel fell from his horse. Yes, that's it! Just keep that Orc away from me!
If you're looking for information, then you've come to the right place! I am the most knowledgeable broker in the refuge.\n\nOn the other hand, if you work for the town guard, I have no idea what we're talking about.
The priestess holds them in the Teeth of Sithis. Use the tunnel beneath the waterfall to reach the xanmeers on the ridge above. \n\nWe will regroup at the top of the western xanmeer once you've found the others.
I thought for sure I'd covered my tracks well enough to avoid any run-ins with Quintus's friends, or enemies. Who are you? What did he tell you?
Could you deal with that rather large insect? My blood needs to be aligned, not siphoned completely from my body!
Hmm? What can I do for you, traveler?
Were the words the same for you? Sometimes written language likes to confuse me. Words change and switch places. Very annoying.\n\nAnyway, the gravestone mentions the Betrayer. Sounds like a dastardly chap. I wonder if I ever met him?
Many greetings, walker! Please, make yourself at home. We Baandari take great pride in our hospitality.
It's taking a lot out of her. I can feel it. Selene's going to need a lot from all of us before this battle is done.
Zamarak does not wish to remain in Star Haven if that Dragon decides to return. Let us keep moving.
Thank you, five-claw! Azin-jo may be blind to the truth, but I'm glad you saw through the false god.
This is as pure an expression of anguish and sorrow as this one has ever seen.\n\nNow that Vijari sees it for what it is, it pains him to blot out his father's final work.
Poor Buzinda. I can't imagine how upset she must be right now.\n\nIf we do infiltrate the cult, we should find Lahini and convince her to leave. Or force her to if she won't listen to reason.
You found the place! And Safik is well? Good. Let this one guess, Sormund blusters like a Pahmar squall. Pay him no mind. He is like a harbor mutt, yes? Bark, bark, bark, but no teeth.\n\nNow, we have work to do—that is, if you still mean to help?
Make sure you keep up, walker.
I have a feeling we're not done with the Icereach Coven just yet, but at least the Skald-King is safe.\n\nGo on. He wants to talk to you.
Turn this place upside down. We need to find out exactly what the Gray Host has planned.
How could Meridia allow High Priest Varkour to become so … corrupted? Has she lost all power? Or worse, is she as heartless as the other Daedric Princes?\n\nRegardless, you must retrieve the relic!
<Pickle looks determined. He wags his tail.>
You're back! Thank Kyne. Master's been muttering like my great aunt Hjolren. She hit her head on a stone, see? Now she says all kinds of terrible things—just low enough that you can't hear it.\n\nYou don't think my master hit his head, do you?
Things are coming to a head and they need you in the Blue Palace! You heard about High King Svargrim, right? What am I saying, you were there! Of course, you were there!\n\nBut Princess Svana, she wants all her allies around her for this.
My friend. I thought I could catch Rada and Lady Belain. Convince him to ….\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry I failed us. They acquired the keystone and escaped across the river. Toward that Dwarven structure in the distance.
I am sorry I cannot be more help to you. All the fighting and running has worn me out.\n\nOnce we are free of this place, you have my word that I will do anything you ask. Upon Leki's blade, I swear it.
Thank the gods we have better matters to attend to than the deployment of troops and suspicions of treachery. For a man called Despot, the ard is in an agreeable mood.\n\nBut that's not your concern. It's good to see you once more.
This is horrible. Nathari has convinced herself that she's doing the will of the Spirit Queen—and she persuaded at least some of the clan to go along with this madness.\n\nWe have to find a way to stop her!
Are you here to speak with Councilor Sophus? I'm afraid my husband has taken our dog for a walk.\n\nIs there something I could help you with, perhaps?
I'm leaving this to you. My brigadines are soldiers, not investigators. Besides, I'd rather not send the entire fort into a panic.\n\nTalk to the other servants. See what they can tell you about Talaise and her actions today.
I must remember that the Horn of Magnificence is only one part of Phalevon's legacy. In this case, discretion is the better part of valor. I suspect my ancestor never quite grasped that lesson.
Tava's feathers, this is so exciting! Who else in the world has a ghostly beau to talk to? Other than crazy spinsters, I mean.\n\nWhat an adventure!
Forget me, just save the others. Those Argonians are working them to death.
Leyawiin and its citizens are in danger, and Lovidicus is only telling the Chamber of Legates about this now?\n\nThis one knew we weren't done with Leovic and the Longhouse Emperors. She just knew it.
I should have gone with her. She didn't want to risk it. She told me to look after our son until help came. \n\nOh, Bevene, I did that much …! I'm sorry.
No use letting that weapon rattle around in your pack. Equip it, then I'll help you work out the cobwebs.
So, any chance I could talk you into enlisting in the Ivory Brigade? No? I didn't think so.\n\nI want to thank you for helping us with all this. I hate to imagine what would have become of Blackwood if not for you and Eveli. I'm in your debt.
I have always been fond of Fargrave. One can find such interesting things here. I am rather pleased that you did not allow it to be razed to the ground by Mehrunes Dagon's hordes.\n\nAnd I do find all that talk about conquest and destruction so boring.
Where is Lyranth, mortal? As you heard, the Bladebearers have found Sister Celdina and her cultists. The Waking Flame has nowhere left to run.
I will lead my scouts back to the portal. Make sure they return to the Deadlands safely. Then I will meet you in this citadel Dothaz spoke of.\n\nThere must be a reckoning for what they have done to my Kyn. It is the Bladebearers' way.
Another new hireling? Do you know what you're getting into? The last group didn't respect their enemy. I ended up having to cure thirteen different time sensitive poisons.
I don't think we've been introduced, but you walked towards me with a lot of intention. It's very presumptuous of you. Are you on Saraathu Tong Business?
I'll meet you and the others in Nirn at the place you specified. Leyawiin, was it? \n\nWe'll talk later.
Hey there! Lady Arabelle sent me to find you. She wants to talk about everything that happened on Amenos.\n\nShe's waiting for you in the courtyard behind Mandrake Manor.
I've got to get out of here! Why didn't I just drown in that shipwreck?\n\nThey turned them into coral. Sunigil—those Eldertide bastards turned him into this … glow. Then they fed the glow to the coral.
You and this druid have our thanks, mortal. You trusted us, and now the balance of nature has been restored.
Isobel writes us, tells us all about her travels with you. She says she's learning so much!
Can you imagine a more beautiful place to serve during this war? I wish I had more time to enjoy the view. But the patients keep me so very busy.
Ah, hello there. Say, you look like the type who could go traipsing around dangerous areas in search of rare ingredients. Could I interest you in a job? There's coin in it for you, and the knowledge that you'd be bringing joy to many in Gonfalon Bay.
So, Sorinne really has shaved her tail. Kra! My fun-loving sugarsnap, ruined!\n\nLooks like Raenobi will have to remind her who she is the hard way.
Trouble on Amenos, Perditte says. Feh. There's always trouble on Amenos. I wouldn't set foot there for a purse full of coin.
Druid Laurel studies the old lore. Young, yet wise. We must tell her what we learned from the elder's memory.\n\nLet us try this passage. I sense gentle wind and open sky beyond.
I assumed these Ascendant Order knights were going to provide a challenge, but they ran the moment we began to cut them down.\n\nThey did mention the Ascendant Lord, though. He's definitely inside the mountain.
Perhaps I was somewhat unfair to the young Count Mornard. Now, I'm not saying I was totally wrong, mind you. But Stefan at least seems to have a vision. That's more than I could ever say about his father, gods rest his soul.
If you can spare a few moments, my master would like to have a word with you.
Dreughside's returning to normal. We'll cordon off the dreugh and let the guards sort things out.\n\nGuess your work here's done.
If the Withered Hand is planning something else, I hope we discover what it is quickly. Preferably before they are able to carry it out.
Go on now. The blade is restored and I must rest. Take it to someone you trust to keep it safe.
I still can't quite believe what's happened. I'm not sure how I will explain it to the younger students.\n\nNo matter. Leki's Blade needs a strong leader. This duty falls to me.
Go on. I will not suffer the humliation of being arrested. I will turn myself in.
I just can't believe my Rosalie would … it's just unthinkable.\n\nI owe you for my life, and for my daughter's welfare. Though she wants to thank you herself.
Well done. When we get back to town, I'll raise a tankard in your name.
Please. Go away! There is … nothing you can say that will console me.\n\nMy sweet Casnar is either dead, or he's decided he doesn't love me! I-I don't know which is worse!
Ha! Now you're just showing off. \n\nBut I'm glad to see you alive and well. Darien, too. Tamriel would be a poorer place without the two of you in it.
I tried to stop him, but it was all I could do just to keep him from killing Father Quiston!\n\nDamn it all! What are we going to do now?
Around here, we're working hard to put an end to the Withered Hand. A wealthy benefactor is paying the guild to kill that scum on sight. \n\nInterested in a contract?
Make sure my brother doesn't ruin the reputation of House Rii.
If you wish to aid us, gather the items I requested. Ashreeds grow in the tidepools in our quarter, and mudcrabs thrive on the shores nearby.\n\nGather some of each and present them at the roots of our Hist.
The Worm Cult nearly unlocked the secrets of the <<z:1>>. If they could get their hands on it, so could anyone else.\n\nThis torment will never end, unless you're the one to end it.
The look on your face … you've discovered where the grandmaster's son is being held?
Enter <<1>> and find Balreth. Garyn will be right behind you. Meanwhile, the troops and I will hold the portal. \n\nGood luck.
Were you successful? I came to help, but there was a ward on the door. I couldn't get past it.
It will take time to deal with the Daedra that came through before you closed the portals. We'll be busy for a while, it seems.
The longer we're trapped, the greater the chance we'll turn feral … or be eaten by them.
She wants the Fang? I say, give it to her! If it does to her what it did to me ….\n\nWait, maybe that isn't such a good idea.
Chilling. Look at this place. It was deliberately set on fire.
My wife's happiness means everything to me.
Crime has been detected; justice must be done.
Something has to be done about these undead.
Just the person I wanted to see. I've puzzled out the hints from that last book … and I'm afraid the news isn't good. Your next trial is in a particularly nasty part of the Shivering Isles. A place called the Chateau of the Ravenous Rodent.
Adept, you cannot listen to this offer. This is the exact same offer Sheogorath made me when I first lost Eyevea!
It'll be fun to watch the Worm Cult deal with angry spirits, now that they can't control them!
I am <<c:1>>, the spiritual advisor to the Bosmer people. I have been captured by Wood Orcs from <<2>>. I could use your help, if you are able to provide it.
We must see to it that no more monsters invade our world from yours.
Well fought! Well fought indeed!
The treasure turned out to be garbage. What a waste of time.
This way, this way.
Please, just leave me be.
Soldier, we ….\n\nWait, you're no scout. Identify yourself.
Help me! They're after me!
I know you helped all of the mages before you chose a side, but such generosity could return to harm you.\n\nBe careful out there.
You're on the quest!
Thanks for breaking me out back there.\n\nListen, while you're in a heroic mood, want to help me get something I left with the Goblins?
I'm looking forward to getting back to the open seas.
Until the Pact controls Drakelowe Keep, it is not safe for you in Cropsford.
I don't like this at all, you understand?\n\nI'm doing this for the Daggers and their families. That's all.
Find my brother and get him to return that egg before he winds up getting hurt. Or worse.
So it's really come to this? Knights of the Flame killing each other? I agree with Sir Edmund, but I'm not willing to go that far.
Act quickly, decisively. The Claw is so close.
This place sure got to Captain Arakh. I've never seen anyone so paranoid before.
Be gentle when you speak with <<1>>. She has been through much, and fears for her friends.
Get into the drinking tents and set some fires. Kill anyone that tries to stop you.\n\nCause enough commotion and Ren'dro's men will come running. Then make for the compound.
The rats are gone. If his conscience allows it, our inspector lets us continue our way of life. All is well.
This is <<1>>'s lodge. You can't enter without permission.
Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll pack up with the Mercs, and get out of here as soon as we can.
I have spells to prepare. If you must speak, you should do so with Warlock Carindon.
Don't worry, I'm working up to writing those papers. I work best when I'm under pressure. You'll see!
So much blood. The cries. I can still hear them. Oh Divines, so much pain.
It is you! A pleasure. May the light of the Bright Moons bless and keep you. Why are you here?
You're investigating things? Good. Leave no stone unturned, and remember … the construction of Woodhearth in Greenshade, the founding of the Daggerfall Covenant, and the invention of the steel-toed shoe are all part of their plan.
Mortals! Show a little concern and this is the thanks you get! And where is the constable? Why isn't he here? But that is a mystery for another time.\n\nThe survivors are our priority. Still, these vampires … they are most unusual.
The Ring of Stendarr's Mercy is at the back of the crypt. With it lies the greatsword that belonged to Sai Sahan's father.
I keep thinking how that could have been me.
Without the Fangs, the Anchor is vulnerable. Let us fling these vile creatures from our world!
Ah, Count Verandis. So good to see your striking visage again.
By the Divines, the ale servers in this place get uglier by the day.
What happened to the House Councilor is unforgivable. I hope you made those responsible pay for what they've done.
I sense a lightness in the air … as if some of the darkness has been dispelled. I can't be sure though, is it because the priests lit another torch, or was it you?\n\nDid you destroy Molag Bal's evil shrines?
Once we destroy the progenitor and free the prisoners, the Scaled Court won't be able to create more of the mantikoras.
We don't want any trouble, stranger. We're a peaceful village, far from the turmoil of Orsinium and its newfangled ways.
If you have a letter from the Forge-Mother, then you've come to the right place. Just be aware, this isn't official Daggerfall business. Wrothgar is open to anyone who genuinely wants to help us build the city of Orsinium.\n\nOr so I've been told.
You freed Egnatius, yes? I'd hate to think I was coursed down like a hare for nothing.
If you're ever in Orsinium, come find Shalda and me. We really want to buy you a drink for what you did for us. It's the least we can do.
I haven't seen the demiprince so pleased in quite some time! \n\nYou've really given him hope that he might be able to reconstitute his missing barons.
Welcome to the finest tavern on the Gold Coast! We know how to show a visitor a good time, you can bet your boat on that!
No fine wine for me? No matter. I'll open the cask <<1>> stole from the docks.
You did it! With the beams activated, we should be able to enter the temple now.
Braadoth's throne room is way at the back of this complex. The faster we get there, the faster we can finish this business, right?
Stay your lash, slaver. I work. Whipping me will not motivate me further.
I don't know if I should wait here or go get the House Guard, but I hate to abandon my miners to those horrible cultists!\n\nWhatever you do, don't go into the Shulk Ore Mine!
I want you to have those grumps in stitches, one way or another!
Though Pelinal is seen as a controversial figure by some, none can dispute the mark he left on our land and culture. \n\nAnd so we cry: hail the Whitestrake!
The factotums reported a strange energy signature in Gascone's rectory. Did you find anything odd in there?
I always share a few words of advice with the hopefuls that weren't selected before I take the new apprentice under my wing. \n\nThe Everwound Wellspring provides excellent opportunities for the novice apostles.
Would you stay with me in my final moments? I mean, I won't remember I suppose. But I'd rather not do it alone.
If you search for salvage, you have come to the right place, walker. Na'jhargo received a fresh shipment of cranks and cogs just days ago!\n\nWhat can this one get you?
Well, now that that's all over and done with, we can get back to the exciting stuff! I can't wait to crawl around in some of these clockwork contraptions.\n\nAnyway, thanks for helping Raynor. I really do worry about him, you know.
While the Golden Knight recovers, we must make preparations for breaching the Daedric barrier. Since I can't remember where that particular pathway goes, we'll have to be ready for any contingency.\n\nI also need to tell you about another memory.
See what I mean? I thought this enchantment was a bit of foolishness, but there's no frivolity in those words. I think the book means to hurt us!
Don't let your guard down out there. Especially with Faidur at your back.
I'm beginning to think you two are connected in some way. I'll be watching.
Narazda did not stay in this Alkosh forsaken place to be ignored.\n\nListen well, walker. The garden that lies ahead is the only way forward, but dangers lurk within. Still, we must pass through if we ever hope to face Vykosa.
We should not delay. The Remnant is within our grasp.
You look burdened, ojel. Please, sit and let the breeze carry your cares away. The Bright-Throats have brought us many nice things to share.
Wasseek eyes are watching. Can you feel them?\n\nI do not like it.
Got the skink, eh? Well done!\n\nYou should deliver him to Jee-Lar quick as you can. Don't want him running off again, right?
Ah, is that the aroma of toad musk I smell? How delightful!\n\nI hope you were gentle with the little croakers. They need to be calm and relaxed to produce the most pleasing sounds.
Thank you for all your help. I now see my fears were overblown. Sulahkeesh has been nothing but pleasant.
I appreciate you accompanying me, but I must admit I have something of an aversion to insects. And snakes. And waterfalls.\n\nStill, Lady Laurent does know best when it comes to situations such as this. I'll meet you out in the swamp, my friend.
You return. Good. Vazbi already loses too much today.\n\nSilhu-jo did not—Vazbi could not …. He is gone. His soul wanders the Sands Behind the Stars now.
I'm practically my old self again! Well, not that old. I feel like me, not that other me from long ago.\n\nOh, this is so confusing! Let's just keep going. Tally-ho!
I'm positively fuming. Iulius has our entire wardrobe shipped here from Kvatch, and he still manages to pick out the exact same outfit I'm wearing. As if it weren't clear enough we're twins.\n\nBut you're not here to listen to a sibling's prattle.
Perhaps you have been more helpful than this one's vagrant son. Tell Kideya, have you made any progress with our missing farmhands?
Greetings, walker. Forgive me if I seem sour. Ri'hirr strained his back climbing out of bed. Old age … it comes for all of us eventually.
You showed spine when we spoke in Rimmen. We will see if your actions match your brave words, yes?
You return. Lightly singed, but no worse for the wear, eh?\n\nWhy do you come back to me? You have what you seek, yes?
Welcome to Riverhold, friend. You should feel fortunate to have found the finest collection of cloth in all of Elsweyr. Let Thadarra know if you see anything you like.
What are you waiting for? Kill the dummy! It's not like it's going to kill itself. Or will it? Now you've got me thinking.
I'll never get used to a Dragon landing in front of me.
When we saw the island begin to break apart, it was all I could do to stop Za'ji and Caska from leaping into the Pounce and sailing off to fish you out of the sea.\n\nCan you imagine, trying to navigate while parts of the island were raining down?
Who are you? And why do you pursue me? First at Havil's farm and now you emerge unscathed from these accursed ruins. If Maxten sent you to bring me back to her, I won't go.\n\nEveryone should just stay away before I kill them as well.
I don't know a horker's arse from magic, but I know if you dam a river the lake dries up. Stopping the curse's source should have freed Bjora.\n\nLet's head back to that old tree and check on her.
With my cure in circulation, those that brave the journey to freedom will be safe from the affliction. Dark Moon Grotto will continue to serve as a safe haven for weary refugees.\n\nWe could not have done this without your help. Thank you.
That took a lot out of Verandis. I hope we got what we needed. \n\nTalk to him and see how he's doing.
Just once, it would be nice if Quistley showed some … appreciation … for having his chestnuts hauled out of the fire.\n\nI don't think he understands how much danger he was in.
Well, she certainly acts like Annyce. I'll be keeping my eye on her all the same.
The frog pool. That's where the Nereid first transformed my brother. It's a bit farther into the ruins.\n\nOnce Deet-Loh starts singing, the other frogs are sure to join in. That should appease Sister of Pools.
Eveli says you have something for me to look at?
I knew I felt something strange. Like glass shattering in the distance.\n\nWho are you and why have you disrupted the wards?
These are troubled times, but so far the Three Banners War has stayed out of Blackwood. I hope you're not one of those who has ideas about bringing it here.
I've been all over Stormhaven, but somehow I never seemed to spend any time in Wayrest. The Silvelles occasionally traveled here, but not with me. Now I know why.
It's worse than I ever could have imagined. This vast collection of items from Oblivion are seeping their energy into everything around them. All these chaotic forces are warping the world in unpredictable ways.\n\nWe can't leave things as they are.
Lyranth … she took the power of the Ambitions. \n\nBut we defeated Dagon. The egonymic worked. I feel like I can finally breathe again.
The potion of disguise is ready. It contains the ingredients you gathered, a few components of my own design, and just enough bits of the dead cultist to enhance the illusion. Take a heaping scoop from the cauldron and drink up, little mortal!
We—we did it! They're free! I can't believe this. After Mehrunes Dagon cut them both down outside the Temple and then trapped them in the Sever—unable to move on—it was too long. Thank the Three. And you! Especially you, Magician!
Sorry, I can't read that. You should show it to Lyranth.
You take care of those deep druid idols and I'll make sure we've got something to celebrate with afterward. Eye on the prize, right?
Anton's on the run for his life. He may have left signs of where he went. As we search deeper within, we should look for anything that points in his direction.\n\nIn the meantime, that winner's stage to the north seems like a good place to start.
There's our rescue. Time to go!
Hey, friend! I hoped to find you in Gonfalon Bay. Hard to resist its charms, eh?\n\nAnyway, Lady Arabelle wants a word with you. She says we're not quite done yet.
You need to cut all three mooring lines. Check both the port and the starboard sides, then get on board!
I'll be fine, you two go on. You learn how to be quick and quiet when you lead a merchant crew, mark my words.
You have been such an unexpected help to Lady Arabelle. I can't imagine where we would be now without you.
Welcome, friend. I don't believe I've seen you around Vastyr before. How can the Society of the Steadfast help you?
The Ascendant Order on Galen? Hard to believe. Then again, I've seen Dragons in Elsweyr and Dark Anchors in High Rock, so I suppose anything is possible.
Oh, there you are! Are you ready to try again?
Do you understand why I am concerned? Some of the greatest heroes in history are buried here—kings, queens, legendary warriors …!\n\nIf they've risen, it is Ash'abah duty to kill them, and that's not going to be easy.
Thank the Eight you came back. Do you know what's going on? \n\nSome creepy man named Sentulus was here, and then my mother tied me up and left!
It is a privilege to meet you, I'm sure, but I am on official business for Queen Arzhela.\n\nI most humbly take my leave.
Our trust in you was well-placed. We do not celebrate the girl's death, but the life of the forest will finally grow to its true potential.\n\nWe know it was not an easy choice.
I hope someday we'll be able to repay the favor for your services here today.\n\nThe Baandari are elusive. Without you, I'm sure their business would have continued to flourish in Sentinel.
The soldiers have been warned. I think I know a way to find the assassins lurking about the fort.
Kill the Goblin warchief and the spider queen. We'll never get a better chance.
You saved my life. I'll never forget the debt I owe you.
You found my sons? I'm in your debt. I'm sure they're on their way here now.\n\nThis cave they spoke of must be the one on the western edge of the pools.
If you were the one working with <<1>>, please see <<2>>.
It can't be. It's madness!
Stop, traveler. \n\nNone may enter the Hollow without the express permission of Lady Almalexia.
Welcome to Mournhold, muthsera. While events in the Temple remain secret, the Ordinators know of your deeds.
Friend! Stendarr had a hand in your return to us, I think.
The touch of Molag Bal. Dries my scales just thinking about it. We have to stop their rituals, put an end to the abominations.
You dare address me? Insolent dog!\n\nThose who call themselves "stormwardens" are hardly fit for the title. They can barely control the storms, much less dispatch intruders from our sacred grounds!
Hail, my new friend! The touch of the divine inspired me, told me you'd succeeded in your task. Is it true?
Oh, I'm so little and helpless. I don't know what I'll do without someone brave and strong to save me.
<<1>> has enough excuse to flay my hide. I don't want to give her another.\n\nShe's looking this way. Leave me be.
Accept my gratitude.
I'm not sure you're supposed to be here.
You did us a good turn. Rama owes his life to you.
Looks like the plan was a success. Despite the collateral damage. Such is life, soldier.
Destroy the siege weapons, tents, and cargo first. Then go after the Colovian command. \n\nWe have a score to settle with these guys. We're going to take it personally.
Clear the city, end the Daedric threat, and we can meet at the temple. We can usher in a new era of unity for this Aldmeri Dominion.
I could hear the fire salts exploding from here. Good work. My agents will make quick work of the Dominion's forces.\n\nNow, to end this. Do you still have the Relleis Lor keystone?
The Elder Scroll of Ghartok has been captured by Dominion forces. A great victory!
I still don't trust the Dremora, but killing Ifriz would certainly make me feel better. Anything that shuts him up would be a welcome reprieve.
Apologies, I can't be bothered right now.
The Collies are on the run, and Kazirra's thrilled. By the Green I wish we could stop for a brew. But no such luck. You have more work to do.
We need to find a portal stone to reach my clan's council of elders. There's one near the camp where we found the dead soldier. Let's get out of here and see if my clan will talk to you now.
Have you considered my proposal? Will you help me save my children and set them free?
My mother … I can't believe it. Why?
Go, then. I will finish this without you.
Our forces are back in control of the city. If you see any Imperial stragglers skulking about, let me know.
Tread lightly now. The timber mammoth is as rare and skittish as they come. I nearly had it, but the damned birds spooked it.
Joining Brackenleaf's Briars is nothing to take lightly. Many have died attempting the trials, and there is always the threat of the Outsider.
It's good to breathe mundane air again, but we have a lot to do to prepare. No time for dallying.
Sai Sahan has something to ask you.
Lord Varen is waiting for you. It's time.
Please. I just need a moment to catch my breath.
That went better than I expected! Jode's Chariot will put the cartel's money to good use.\n\nThank you for your part in this. We are in your debt.
Many more worthy than me have given their lives to protect this kingdom. My husband … my children …. \n\nI am not afraid to join them.
So Hircine chooses to speak to you rather than us, his faithful servants. I admit to a bitter feeling, but perhaps it is for the better this way.\n\nProvided you do not betray us.
Just one more tile, I think. Now which one was it?
We must find a way to defeat the Anka-Ra and activate the beams that open the temple door.\n\nThen we can enter the Seeker's Archive and find the knowledge to defeat the Celestials.
I suppose the Scroll is never wrong, but I had hoped….\n\nGo. You have to find her. All the pieces are in place to bring about a conclusion—for good or ill.
Find the Sanctuary. Open the Black Door. Your Brothers and Sisters wait to greet you with open arms.\n\nI look forward to watching your progress, Initiate. And once again, welcome to the family.
I don't know how long I can keep stalling them. Find Qamar's stash!
You have restored the Seeker's Sight. Good. \n\nWe have explained everything to Hara and she has agreed to help us. Speak to her when you are ready to proceed.
The Scaled Court's venomous leader killed poor Kelmen without remorse or hesitation.\n\nBut the ritual worked. I know where to find her—Loth'Na Caverns.
Ah, it warms my scales to see you once more, my friend. I wish I could thank you for my freedom, but as you can see, it was short lived.\n\nI see you still wear no shackles. Will you aid me once more? I know someone who needs help.
Whew! Got it right the first time! No explosions … yet.\n\nGo ahead. You can take it. I'm sure it's stable. Mostly sure. Once the tonal inverter is in your possession, talk to me and I'll tell you how it works.
Did you see? Bolin! It was him. He seemed … whole again.
Razum-dar apprehended the Kinlady. They're at the west edge of the Coral Forest.\n\nWhat happened to Aldarch Tilcalar? Did he escape?
Keep going. Valsirenn will make sure we aren't too far behind you.\n\nThe Heart is close. I can feel it.
Though it may appear menial in nature, refining dust into ounces is a foundational and essential exercise for all practitioners of the art of jewelry crafting. \n\nFrom the raw means of nature, beauty is wrought.
We did it! We actually managed to collect the indrik's heart. Now we just need to deliver it to Hircine.
Did you make it in time, or did those Blackguards make off with the relics?
The wind welcomes you, Xukas-friend. You have the Remnant Chime?\n\nPlease, settle an old lizard's spines. The beast Xukas mentioned. It did not gnaw or shed water on it, right?
My half-sister. She's not only a stain on our family name, she's the reason we're up to our necks in Dragons and the walking dead! The time has come to deal with Euraxia.\n\nPermanently.
A small strike force, like an arrow loosed at a specific target. Nala-do approves of this plan.
Activate the final relic, five-claw, and my attunement will be complete.\n\nThen, no matter what else happens, we will have a chance to stop the Betrayer and the Dragons.
You killed a Dragon. Impressive, but don't let it go to your head. It was just one, and not even that large of a specimen.\n\nPlus, of course, no one will remember your feat. They're all going to be talking about the return of their queen.
Ugh. Another stranger. Hopefully, you aren't obsessed with mucus like the last one.
Well, that went horribly wrong, didn't it?\n\nWe should let Sai Sahan know what happened. Maybe he'll have an idea about how we salvage this operation.
Keep moving, five-claw. We need to destroy the focal points before Kaalgrontiid can initiate his ascension.
Hmm? Yeah, just give me a moment. Talk to Marekki, eh? She'll want to say thank you, I bet.
Read the scroll, then we'll talk.
I'm surprised to see the princess here. As you can see, the influx of refugees has made this place much more hectic than usual.\n\nIs there something I can do for Princess Svana?
I loved growing up in Morthal. The kind people, the sound of lapping water, the smell of cut wood. It all just makes me feel safe.\n\nBeing close to home again brings me so much comfort.
It's a good thing Ena found out about the surprise attack. We're still not prepared, but at least now we have a little warning. \n\nGood luck out there. We're depending on you.
My father wishes to speak with you. Don't keep him waiting.
Are you sure you have time to talk to me? Shouldn't you be cooking with the frostheel?
If you find my father, tell him this isn't his fault. Nobody would have expected the Thornroots to sink so low.
We better hurry. I came a long way to make sure none of these councilors died, and I've already let two of them down.\n\nI'll meet you at the fort. It's to the east, across the river.
Let's be on our way.\n\nA word of warning, though: some of the golems may wander the halls ahead. There shouldn't be many of them, but as my master used to say, prudence is victory's prophet! Sorry. He was very keen on weird proverbs.
Many enter the Blood Pit. Few come out again. In truth, I did not know mortals were so resourceful. And more resilient than I had been led to believe.\n\nOr perhaps you are just an unusual example of your kind.
The kynreeve is not one to trouble himself with mortal allies. Perhaps there is more to you than is immediately evident.
It looks like the Ascendant Order's preparing that ship for sea. Check with Captain Kaleen. She's got an idea about how we can steal that ship right out from under them.\n\nAnd if I get to shred a few rogue knights along the way, so much the better.
Didn't expect I'd see you again. Don't tell me you found another piece of my map.
I'm counting on you, mercenary. Save my son and you can name your price.\n\nDhulef says Rahval and Ellic are by the bridge east of Vastyr. Talk to them. They know parts of Galen no one else has even seen. They must have an idea where to find Stefan.
You're willing to talk? At least you're smarter than those knights outside. I suppose Sealord Nalos and his scum have taught the people of this island to fear anyone with blue skin.\n\nUnderstand this—I don't answer to that foul beast.
An even older set of tunnels beneath the cellars? And locked by a Shard of the Green? What's Lord Bacaro hiding down here?
Green preserve us … first Archdruid Rahval and now … now my father ….\n\nMy father's under all that rubble! Please, you have to help me. There must be survivors! Why are you just standing there?
If I don't kill myself, the Omen will possess me.\n\nVaermina will have my soul.
I didn't trust Kerbol before, and I certainly don't trust her now. But why didn't Draven trust me?
It may seem unappreciative to ask more of you, but I would be neglecting my duty to the Daggerfall Covenant if I did not inform you of the tragedy at Bangkorai.\n\nAny hope of peace there seems to have dried up in the wake of recent events.
You there! There's gold for you, if you'll lend me your time.\n\nI am a scholar of some import. Hah! Import. That is to say, I've traveled quite far, from Cyrodiil, just to study this forgotten shore. I sorely need an assistant.
Captain Hjolm lost his life bravely defending the fort from that Covenant scum. He cut down a score of them, but eventually succumbed to his wounds.\n\nThat magnificent fetcher will be missed.
Leel-Vata is a skilled mage, but she is still just one Saxhleel.\n\nPlease, find her and bring her back safely.
You're welcome here, walker in shadow and in light. The Shadowscales will always count you as an ally.\n\nUnless the Night Mother commands otherwise. But you know this, yes?
Too few have the strength to oppose the Reach shamans. Hurry, before they do more evil here.
Squeak! Squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak!
Our people would be food for crows without you, my friend.
I believe those <<mz:1>> are physical manifestations of stories woven by the Bosmer's three most powerful spinners.\n\nIf you take them from the Houndsmen in the ravine below, we'll know for certain.
My friend. It is good to see you again. Your talisman? Razum-dar sees you have met Sinien.\n\nCheerful, isn't she?
Stay back! This cave is filled with Daedra.
I can't believe this is happening.
You claim that Gorak killed dozens of villains? And a foul necromancer, as well?
Good, good! This one hoped he would find you. Mim worried that some terrible fate had befallen you.\n\nThere was a terrible commotion and then the Observer appeared. He seemed angry, but also kind of excited. What did you do?
Aren't you finished yet?
There is no time. The door must be opened and you must go after Wormfather. \n\nI'll make the sacrifice. It's the right thing to do. It'll ensure my place in Sovngarde at least.
The Red Rooks will scatter, now they've lost their leader. \n\nI wish … I wish I had never gotten involved with these bastards. I'll regret that decision always, but will try to make up for it as best I can.
Indaenir said you might be coming. And you're here not a moment too soon. As our living soldiers fall, the ranks of the dead swell. \n\nAt this rate, we'll all be fighting for the other side by tomorrow's dawn. And that's not even the worst part.
Hallowed … you have come, as Hunal saw reflected on the moons last night. This one sees the cool light of the moons reflected in your eyes. You have greatness in your future, yes?
I never thought it could be this bad. I'm used to being able to think through my problems. Using my books and spells to … there's no solution to this in a book.
<<1>> would like a moment of your time.
Welcome back, lovely! Zara wondered when you would return. She missed you terribly. \n\nThe other contenders should thank Jone and Jode that championships are not won by physical attraction. Your sleekness would best them all.
Thank you for helping me fulfill my promise. With <<1>>'s death, I showed mother I will follow in her footsteps.
I believe that the injustice done to Zariya has kept her spirit from making the journey to the Far Shores.\n\nI hope that if you perform this act of consecration, it will bring her the peace she deserves.
I will pay whatever you require. Just help me. I will give anything to get her back.
Meet me at my house. It's at the edge of town, past the smithy.\n\nI'll tell you everything I know. See you soon, I hope.
I certainly hope the real afterlife is better than this abomination.
Gilraen and her archers can hold the barrier at the center of town, but the north and south fronts are crawling with Daedra.\n\nThey'll close in on her if we don't stop them.
Pretend we're old friends catching up after a long absence. I don't want to blow my cover just asking for help.
All the Covenant rejoices that the Elder Scroll of Altadoon is now ours!
Courage, my friend. That is the most important of all virtues. Courage is not a lack of fear, rather, it is the realization that there are things more important than fear.
The others are going to give us a little time to find a safe location to use as a base. No point in all of us getting captured together.
What could be holding up that shipment? This is terrible for business, just terrible!
I'm sure it looks worse than it actually is.
That look on your face says you didn't get to the top of the Archive.\n\nAt least you got some horrendous wounds from it, eh? Get back up there. Those stairs aren't going to climb themselves.
You return resembling a drowned rat, but you are unbroken. The Maormer were not so fortunate I hope.
Hey there, scrub. You'd best stay back. We are speaking of blood and glory. For we are Undaunted!
Ramash may be too proud to ask for help from outsiders, but I'll take whatever I can get.\n\nOrcs don't scare easy, but the remaining members of the clan are getting restless. They want to know what happened to their friends and families. And so do I.
Too salty. One handful of salt, next time.
Oh, thank Trinimac! You're not one of those Dwarven-Dwemer things!\n\nBut what are you doing down here? Did you come to help me escape from this damn quarry?
I hope your contracts go smoothly, Initiate. Kill well and kill often. Every soul you send to the Void pleases Sithis to no end.
After taking a longer look at the documents you brought back, I have to agree with your assessment. The Ashlander Chodala has somehow siphoned divine energy away from Lord Vivec.
Have you and Narsis finished exploring the tomb yet? I can't wait to hear all about his amazing discoveries!
Ah, I remember! The components for the tonal inverter! Were you able to acquire them?
My, you look like a well-traveled individual! If you're looking to give your mount a well-deserved rest, you've come to the right place.\n\nWe know how to pamper a loyal guar in Balmora.
Barbas … pet hound of the Prince of Bargains. I should have known.\n\nTalk to the Ashlander while I … compose myself.
You returned! I must admit, I wasn't sure you'd be able to do that. Do you have the perception tabulator? And what of Acolyte Variah? Were you able to locate her in there?
Your concern for Tarnished is unusual, but appreciated. She will be fine once the heaving is through.
It looks like you found items with ties to the Wyrd elements. Shall we proceed with Marieve's ritual?
Let's get to work on this curse! I've had enough begging for one lifetime. Just look at my knees! It will take days to wash out these stains!
Little busy at the moment … you know, now's not the time to be wandering around, what with the gruesome killings and clueless investigators. Could wind up dead, or answering questions until you wish you were.
Urlsar and his storm lie beyond this gate. No matter what happens, I want to thank you for standing by me. If it weren't for you I might never have gotten to see Castire again. If this is goodbye, at least it'll be one with closure.
Zaan the Scalecaller. They've taken over her temple, begun to invoke her name. I fear that these facts are no mere coincidence. This cult must be worshiping her, in some fashion. \n\nBut why?
By your hands, my traveling has come to an end. \n\nThank you. A foolish thought, perhaps, but I feel … I feel as though a piece of my tribe is now a part of this village.
You did what I could not, walker. Rakazsa is gone and his misguided beliefs along with him. I only wish the lesson hadn't come at so great a price.
I informed Gharesh-ri and Khamira about what happened in Rimmen. They're mobilizing our remaining forces even as we speak.\n\nNow tell me, what did you learn at the Desert Wind Adeptorium?
We stopped Kaalgrontiid and saved Elsweyr. Not a bad start for our new Dragonguard, right, my friend?\n\nI just wish Abnur Tharn were here to celebrate our victory.
Ah, hello! You're rather … strapping, aren't you?\n\nUm, if you're here about the traps, there's no need to worry. Claudina fixed them right up! She's really quite good at this. I can almost guarantee that they won't trip anyone else today!
I hate to leave these people like this, but taking them with us isn't an option. At least they're far enough away that they haven't drawn the notice of the vampires and harrowfiends.
I had thought after our dealings with bone wolves and curses, you would find other ways to amuse yourself for a time. Yet here you are again, right in the midst of more problems.\n\nWhat can Old Mjolen do for you this time?
You don't look like you're keen to slit my throat, which is a vast improvement from my recent company. Keep your guard up. Something strange is going on around here.\n\nAnd of course my fool brother, Raynor, just jumped headlong into the middle of it.
The desperation, the despair. More and more of our people have disappeared or become harrowed while the survivors crowd inside the walls for shelter.\n\nIf High King Svargrim doesn't act soon, there may not be a Skyrim left to save.
Who is this? One of Caddach's witches?
Adusa-daro? Here? Interesting.\n\nBut you should talk to Kathad. I am much too weak to carry on a proper conversation.
Let me be, harrier. Just need to … just need to get my thoughts sorted.
I'm not sure what this oracle is going to show us. Is that why my palms are sweating?
I don't remember my parents. They never told us anything about them in the vault.\n\nI suppose this means they were loyal subjects of Emperor Moricar. That they were working with Vandacia.
Don't hover over me like a mother netch. I can keep up with you two youngings.
As long as there are still things I wish to learn, I will assist you, little mortal.
You have the items I requested, yes? Then place them in the cauldron so I can complete the potion of disguise.
Much as I would like to test myself against Mehrunes Dagon's wardens, it would be unwise to draw attention to our interest in this seer. If you survive, find me at the Wretched Spire.
Regrets. I was detained. Did you find Vontan? What did you learn?
Greetings, stranger. Is this about Tephilaz's death? Or, I suppose, not death. The Daedra tell me that is not really how it works with them. I imagine he will come back eventually.\n\nDo you know Noroth? The two of you spoke for some time, I saw.
I gathered allies, those who have fought by your side in the past. You certainly accumulated a lot of them in your travels. \n\nLet us hope that between them and the daedrat's knowledge of the fortress, it will be enough.
A ghostly spider, hmm? A bit garish for my taste, but then, we can't all be squinty, desiccated Skein-spawn, can we?\n\nBefore you go, I have something to give you.
I am sure Nilsmon is hovering around somewhere. Tell him I took his poem to read. Later.\n\nHe's sent me an entire recital's worth of odes. Heaping praise upon my various features and body parts. Silly man.
Oh, I think there's a lantern in here. That's pleasant.
Please, go to the Monument Inn. It started there, I just know it!\n\nDamn, I can already feel what little I remembered slipping away. Blast this ancient curse.
You know that feeling when you just want to sink your teeth into something and rip it apart? Well, I'm having one of them right now.\n\nTalk to Lady Arabelle before I decide to go do something stupid.
I'm sorry, but I'm not actually entertaining guests right now. Not much in the mood, really. You're welcome to come calling another time.
Speak up and talk fast. After that surprise attack, I'm not feeling very trusting or hospitable toward strangers.
If you see my idiot brother, cuff him on the ear for me. Our production falls behind with the johads so unreliable.
Aelif is sure she will see you again, hero.
I'll prepare the town for evacuation. Find as many people as you can and send them back here.
Careful, don't get too close to the stone! It appears to be emanating dark necromantic energies.
Bring old <<1>> back in one piece, would you?
That heirloom isn't going to walk over here by itself.
I smell smoke. What happened?
You do not look like a Colovian soldier. It is good to see a friendly face.
It's ugly and getting uglier out here. As our living soldiers fall, the ranks of the dead swell. At this rate, we'll all be fighting for the other side by tomorrow's dawn. \n\nAnd that's not even the worst part.
I think we're in luck. Though most of the local wildlife has fled from the undead, the torchbugs have remained. \n\nMany people do not know this, but torchbugs are among the most perceptive creatures in the forest. They're amazing.
We can't let the Dominion have the keystone. It's too powerful.\n\nOnce it's in our possession we can shift our focus to taking back this town. Is there anything else?
Yes, yes. Raz knows you'll do fine. Don't keep the moon-sugar-induced visions waiting.
The summit is just ahead. The leaders should be arriving any moment.
I've always believed the hunt for ingredients is its own reward.
Ah, there you are! Take the broken pieces and see if you can fit them back into their panels!
The next dish calls for <<z:1>>, some <<mz:2>>, and <<z:3>> to tie it all together.
I'm sure Eveli will come around. Eventually.\n\nIt's you I'm worried about. The seeds of guilt are a heavy burden for anyone to bear.
One of my mates said he saw smoke coming out of Watcher's Hold. That you? Ha! Good work!\n\nThe company's already settled accounts with Sergeant Oufa. If you want your cut, you'll need to track her down. She should be somewhere in Orsinium.
Refer to the list I gave you and find my former hirelings in Molag Mar. They should be able to direct you to places where you can get the components I need to build a tonal inverter.\n\nAs for anything else they may tell you, it wasn't my fault.
Ha! By Malacath, that felt good!\n\nYou know, I've never punched a High Elf before. Felt like punching a pillowcase full of pudding. Almost feel bad for the little runt. Almost. Heh!
I doubt the farmer will be pleased with this verdict, but those chickens were as likely to be eaten by wolves as anything.
I'm sorry … I'm still recovering from the Loremaster's decision. You should talk to him—I can't bear to right now.
Take care getting the keys. The thugs in this palace are Khasda's most loyal, and just as vicious and cruel as he. Expect no mercy, and give none.\n\nSereyne will help keep things quiet, in case fighting breaks out.
I feel there's more to Clan Mother Tadali's words than pure ceremony.\n\nStill, no time to stand around wondering. We have a mask to find! Let's enter the Halls of the Highmane.
That wound's bad. He doesn't have a lot of time. Quick! Talk to him and find out what happened here while I keep watch.
Rigurt's friend Farethor, a butcher from Greenshade, is wintering in Dragon Bridge. His meat is divine! And we can season it with Orcish howlwater. Rigurt knows Mahgrok, in Mor Khazgur, brews it.\n\nWhile you get those, Rigurt will get the final item.
All right—here we are. According to the map, this hatch opens to a walkway that leads to the Grand Archive. Once we're in, let's find the book and get out of here.
Please. I have no time for either constituents or admirers. My life may be in danger!
Come, friend. This is no place for us to linger!
Well that didn't work. Perhaps we chose the wrong pool?\n\nLet's keep looking. One of these will show Sister of Pools my brother has repented. It has to.
Ugh, not another one. Look, I already told you ….\n\nOh, wait, you're not from this tribe, are you? Thank the Divines! I've tried telling these others that my brigadines have nothing to do with their disappearing people, but they won't listen!
Our house is just over there, on the west side of town. There may be something among Annyce's things that points to where she ran off to, but my nerves are too frayed to see it. I'm at my wit's end.
Jephre's bones. The surge of magicka created by the portals you came through … it must have cracked this skyshard. Without a functioning skyshard this gate remains locked and there's no way for us to proceed.\n\nDamn.
We're not likely to find Celdina or her next cataclyst device out here. Let's get inside the citadel and see what we can learn.\n\nLead the way. I'll stand ready to heal you if we run into trouble.
You and Rynkyus can chase his missing Bladebearers. I will return to Fargrave to sift for rumors about Sister Celdina or the cataclyst. And perhaps see if the Anchorite has remembered anything new.\n\nI will find you when your work is done.
It scurries in a most unpleasant manner. Talk to the vermin, little mortal. Find out what it is and whether it can help us decipher the encoded note.
The nearby Greycloak camps are a good place to start looking for the blessed awl.\n\nDo be careful of ferocious beasts. I've heard them howling. The favor of Zenithar won't fall on these laborers if their skill is only used to craft a funeral pyre.
There's a table in Viralaine's laboratory where you can use my blood to brew the antidote. Please, you must hurry.
The Mournhold Chapter. Z'en's price, I was worried this would happen. I don't mean to rattle you, but these bug-lovers almost never lose.\n\nBut this time is different. This time, I'm going to win!
We need to enter the Sunken Road and find that ritual site before Archdruid Michiel frees the nature spirit. And we have to save Wyress Sorcha. Roots and thorns, why are the Firesong so intent on all this violence and mayhem?\n\nCome on, let's go!
You heard Laurel. There isn't a moment to lose. We must reach Druid King Kasorayn's tomb and stop Archdruid Orlaith!
I hope Druid Fenas knows what he's doing. Just be careful of that fire shard. I've seen what a single spark can do to a forest, and I have no desire to become a bonfire!\n\nDamn it all, I don't want to be a tree!
I'm worried about Frii and what Lord Bacaro may be doing to them. The sooner we can get to Y'ffelon, the better as far as I'm concerned.
I'll reassure Gerard.\n\nI'm trading my life for the defeat of a vile Daedra. He'll understand … in time.
You have performed very well in your trials, my friend, but Tu'whacca says the spirits of this place have more to share with you.
Will you help me recharge the Midnight Talisman?
We manage to meet each other in all the nicest places.\n\nYou know, we could be carousing at an inn somewhere. But no. Here we are instead, up to our necks in danger and adventure. Just like old times.
If we must spill his blood to ensure the safety of the village, then that is what we shall do.
I endured their lashes. I endured the burns and the beatings. I will endure the humiliation.\n\nI see the look in your eye, brother. I will endure your disgust and pity as well!
We can't thank you enough for what you've done. With the <<z:1>> sealed away forever, we need not fear necromancers. We need not fear death!
What fresh madness has the General come up with today?
Curious. You dabble in their spells and break into their outpost.\n\nOh, how he misjudged you! How grand!
Excellent! You're a bit slow, but you got the job done. You showed these scaleskins what a real citizen of the Pact will do for the cause.\n\nWe'll get things back on schedule in a few days. The mine's already back to work!
Be ready.
Go carefully along the river, my friend. The forge may be our secret, but enemies are everywhere.
Let's see these clothes, then. Rejmina is deft with needle and thread, should they need adjustment.
You must pick Mim! Do not select that one over there.\n\nHe is evil. Pure evil! Do not make such a terrible mistake.
I just need a moment before I head out. Everything that's happened has been so sudden.\n\nThat and my head is still pounding from whatever Estre gave me.
Ha ha ha. The looks on their faces! Dollie ran so fast, I thought she'd fall on her face. And that old cat, chasing his tail! Oh, thank you. I haven't laughed this hard in years.
Andur intends to kill you. You should see he doesn't.
Stop! Don't make me go back. I was so close to escaping him forever!
We won't make it inside my laboratory unless we stop the lightning.
The Fighters Guild is helping out here in Cyrodiil, trying to rein in the chaos. Interested in a contract?
What you have done is unforgivable, but it will not stop us.
Just so you know, while you're slogging through sewage, we won't be napping out here. \n\nWe'll go ahead and assault the main gate. It'll create a good distraction. It'll also mean that if you fail, we'll all die. Just so you know.
Do you think we'll be all right, going through there? I have to admit, all this fire and brimstone business. I'm a bit … flustered.
A thrice-damned hero, you are. If my ribs weren't so bruised, I'd give you a hug!
Unless this is about Taebod or her portals, I don't have time for it.
My work … all those valuable Dwemer components … all ruined!\n\nJust so you know, I'm going to be upset with you and my sister for a long time over this.
<<1>> will pay the blood price, I'm sure of it. I don't want her dead, but she'll suffer as I do.
Did I hear correctly? Will you be visiting the wrecked ships? If so, perhaps I could impose upon you for a small favor?
Hello, hero. I'd say I'm surprised to see you, but I've been watching you for days. Acting surprised would be so disingenuous.\n\nLet's just say I'm pleased to once again be graced by your company. You're exactly who I hoped to meet out here.
As you recover more rubbings, return here to me. With every detail we add to our model, the closer we get to discovering the location of the lost library!\n\nI prepared a list of the tombs you need to find. Refer to the note as you conduct your search.
Go on. Pretend you belong and no one will notice you, especially once you put on those elegant clothes.\n\nMeet Raz nearby after you talk to her. This one looks forward to hearing what she has to say about all of this.
We were warned that Daedric Princes had their eyes on Summerset, but I didn't expect that level of danger from what was supposed to be a simple investigation.\n\nI suggest you tell the Eye of the Queen what we discovered. I'll catch up with you later.
Kassandra moves quickly for someone who is usually so … deliberate.\n\nWhat is the rush? That is what I ask.
I will spend a little time with Aneshi, five-claw. There are things we need to talk about. Old friends we need to remember.\n\nTake the note and recover the master key. Then meet me and the others in Rimmen.
Mother would never hang a tapestry like that in her cellar, of this Raz is certain. Best for us to examine it.
You made it! I'm afraid this is everyone I've managed to pull together. Hopefully, it'll be enough to deal with the Dragon's blight.\n\nYou can see—ugh—smell the problem right there.
Does the bearded one look tense to you? He look very tense to me. Like a taut string about to snap.
This one is busy. We speak later, yes?
Arkasis does his work out of a place called the Stone Garden. Used to be some Dwarf ruin. I heard he's been out here for years building up a cult of followers. That wouldn't be so bad, but he's got some werewolf guard dogs as well so be careful.
So, what brings a … sturdy hero like you to the Gwylim Annex? I can't imagine you're looking for a book.\n\nThen again, I do see a glimmer of curiosity in your eyes. Perhaps you seek admission to the Antiquarian Circle?
Forgive me, wanderer. I would offer you sanctuary under the watchful eyes of Hircine, but this shrine remains sadly incomplete.\n\nMy apprentices should return shortly with the sacred relics we need to dedicate the shrine to the Hunt-Father.
Go on, step through the portal. I shall be right behind you.
Even a Dremora of my talents cannot hope to stand alone against the Dagonists and an army of living disasters. I seek to learn Sister Celdina's secrets. You want to protect the mortal realm from total destruction.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish both.
I'll let you take the lead here. My history with Skrix will only complicate matters.\n\nLearn what you can. Just remember that he's far from trustworthy.
Ah. A visitor? Or another one of Lady Arabelle's associates? Either way, welcome to our island.\n\nBacaro Volorus, founder of the Society of the Steadfast, at your service. I hope you find your visit to High Isle restful and profitable.
Go. We'll meet you inside. \n\nJust clear a path for us. I don't think either Joslin or Octin will be any help if I need to defend them from something.
I'm sorry I can't be more hospitable at this time. Speak to my seneschal <<1>>.
Thus ends the story of the most sacred sites here in <<1>>.
You still have the note. It needs to be delivered!
Come, my friend. Let's return to the temple.
I rescued her from them. The mercenaries killed her mother, and the other chicks in her brood. This creature had done no wrong, yet they would kill her to be paid for her feathers!\n\nI couldn't stand by and let that happen. Could you?
You know, Tharn's not such a bad chap, once you get beyond the sour expression and the condescending attitude. And the sarcasm, of course. That's rather a bother.\n\nCome to think, he is a bit of a twit, isn't he?
Who are you? What do you seek?
The shield is gone. Kill the doppelganger and grab Sahan before they take him again!
I will pray for poor Ellic. And for Alard, as well. Perhaps Arkay will grant them peace.
The service in this tavern is frustratingly slow.
Well, isn't this intriguing? Look at the attention to detail, the complex composition ….\n\nI can tell that a dedicated artist created this work!
Back so soon, darling? I suppose I'd miss me, too, if I were gone too long.
<<1>> said to keep an eye out for you. Ha!\n\nShe needs to speak with you. Wouldn't keep her waiting.
Ah, you return from a land of grass and sweetrolls to one of snow and mead!\n\nHow was your visit to <<1>>?
Have you come to see our wonder in miniature? Our magnificent tribute to Morrowind?\n\nAlas, the work is not yet complete. And, truth be told, there is more to our miniature Vvardenfell than simply a representation of our land at a reduced scale.
I do hope you'll hurry to Pariah Abbey. I see the other oracles, my friends, languishing in chains. A prison that hurtles through space and time—filled with Daedra and choking steam.\n\nUgh. Gives me vertigo just thinking about it.
This promises to be a fruitful collaboration!\n\nI tasked Kireth and Raynor with acquiring gifts for Varuni, but they tend to wander. Kireth's just there by the cliff. You should speak with her. In the meantime, I'll conduct more research. Questions?
We should leave this place and find the tree. It will clear the waters, I know it.
It was all a lie, wasn't it? She never intended to help my children live.
Do you hear that? The bells sound like they're playing a song. It's faint, but … it's definitely there.
The path leading farther into this sanctuary is hidden from us. I see neither grappling points nor braziers to light. \n\nThere must be another way.
Let's see what Ranza has to say.
You found green stones in the quarry, yes? Where you fought Yahgrondu's corpse?
Sai gathered us and we're ready to go, but it seems like we're destined to simply hurry up and wait.\n\nAnd my father arrived a short time ago. He wants to know whatever we can tell him about the floating island.
They're mad. Beyond all reason. Even in this temple, Meridia's light does nothing to help those afflicted with this feral curse.\n\nWe need to reach the catacombs and find High Priest Varkour.
Oh, good. You made it. Wasn't quite sure I could sneak into Lady Thorn's eerie old castle without your help.\n\nThough, you might not entirely like my plan to get in.
This is a pretty impressive force. Lyranth didn't seem too optimistic about finding allies, but I think she underestimated your influence on people.
So, the relic was some sort of memory stone? Was that a message for the Anchorite or Moricar's heir? Wait a moment, she is Moricar's heir!\n\nHey, if the egonymic gives the Ambitions their power, we only have one of them now! Sombren took Calia's!
Captain Samara is truly a genius when it comes to Dragon-slaying. I must make sure to write everything she says down. For posterity!\n\nYou look like a rough sort. If you're interested, you should speak with her about joining the Elsweyr Defense Force.
Who are you? I saw you using the puzzle stones … how did you unravel their secrets? You don't look like one of the Renrijra, but I warn you, you may be playing with things you can't possibly understand.
Hmm, these runes were drawn in the eighth … no, the ninth house. Have to take that into account.
I'll keep working to open this door.\n\nGo close the portals. Hurry!
All right. Now, on to my problem. There are some rats in my well. I can hear them scraping around down there at the bottom.
Gilraen's our leader. She speaks for us.
We can't let that maggot-eating bastard Gavendien get away with this!\n\nOld Sagabar wasn't so tough after he got into the stocks. He told me where Gavendien went, where their camp is.
What will I do now? Without the Shornhelm Guard I'm nothing. I told the general. I'm a soldier, not a recruiter. But now I'm to be discharged if I fail? It's not right.\n\nI've tried to do my duty, but I can't force people to enlist.
Haven't you left yet? The sites at Balmora, Ald'ruhn, and Barilzar's tower aren't going to investigate themselves.
I always thought my worst humiliations were behind me. I guess I was wrong.
So you're a citizen now? Well done.\n\nI heard something about a constable tossing people down sewer drains. Even in this shrine to knowledge, drooling idiots bumble their way to power. Ludicrous. Moving on, I require your services once more.
Please let me know as soon as the eleven remaining tablets have been found.
I was formulating a spell to track the Dragons when I noticed several surges of arcane energy not far from here. They reminded me of an old acquaintance. Has a way with portals. \n\nIf it is him, I want you to secure his help against the Dragons.
Five-claw, I think I understand. I can draw upon the power of the claw to open a portal to the Jonelight Path.\n\nI think I can do this, yes.
There's only one way to know if the elixir actually works. We have to test it.\n\nTalk to Fenn and see how he wants to proceed.
Good, you've got them. Now go collapse those bolt holes and get to the caverns to stop Vund!\n\nMy partner, Ulang, is still missing … he might be down there. I hope that big idiot hasn't tried anything heroic.
You cried out in your sleep just before you woke up. What happened? Are you all right?
I sense the outsider has returned. I feel energy flowing through the land.\n\nI suspect you and my apprentice were successful in your task. Am I correct in this assumption?
Freyleth has a plan? Be wary, five-claw. Her words drip like honey from her lips, but taste of dust and ash.
The war has started! The Gray Host attacked once and a larger force is marching toward the city!\n\nVerandis sent me to tell Ard Caddach to fall back. To save as many of his people as he can. But the ard won't listen to me. He wants to fight back!
Go ahead, lend yourself to the ritual. Don't be afraid. It won't hurt.
Well, don't keep me in suspense. See what you found and then we can talk.
Think I had damn near every Painted Eye on my tail at one point. The good news is I'm faster than a fireball. Barely.\n\nI already ordered Erilthel back to Commander Axius's camp. Lead these folks out through the sewers and meet her there.
We'll go with Lyranth and gather as many allies as we can. And I'll talk with Calia. She was with Sombren for a long time. She must have some idea how he stole her power. If not, maybe together we can figure it out.
How could anyone in Elegian's state create these cataclysts? It's crazy, but I can't help feeling that there's meaning in his nonsense.\n\nI think he's trying to tell us how to help him. Look for anything related to spring.
Well, we've got his sword. Here's hoping he holds up his end of the bargain. \n\nMortens, I swear to Stendarr ….
The dream of the Society of the Steadfast is a noble one. Soldiers removed from the battlefield can learn to lose the hate they feel for the enemy.\n\nBut somehow I doubt that good wishes alone will stop our leaders from seeking the Ruby Throne.
Want some food or drink? Someone in the inn can get it for you. \n\nBe warned, the cook is terrible. I should know, I used to work there.
This job has taught me a valuable lesson. Always practice due diligence. No more contracts that don't include hazard pay.
I knew there were some rats in the Firesong Circle, but I never imagined treachery like this. Good thing you were here!\n\nGo make sure Laurel and Stefan don't bite off more than they can chew. I'll protect these two.
After you've ensured the city is safe, meet me in the castle, and we'll deal with Duke Renchant. The poor fool probably doesn't even realize he's committed treason.\n\nMay the gods keep you, my courageous friend.
You look strong and capable. Good in a fight and brave enough to travel the world in search of adventure.\n\nIf my assessment is even close to correct, I could use your help.
You can find her in the hall in Mournhold, comrade. May the Eight protect you.
Welcome. Marbruk may look like a small frontier town, but be assured, it is the work of the finest Altmer artisans.
The shrine is on the far side of the room. We must be cautious.
Silencer, is it? I suppose that's fitting. After all, your name is on four of my top contracts now.\n\nThat's just a Dark Brotherhood joke, my friend. I see your sense of humor is still in a distressing state of disrepair.
I'll meet you at the Chapel in Anvil. Hopefully, we'll find Hilde curled up and sleeping under Dibella's statue.\n\nJust be careful when you get to the city. The Pirate Queen hates the Brotherhood almost as much as the Sermonizers do.
Explore that strange portal and locate my missing associate. Do this for me and I'll certainly make it worth your while.
I see something within you. A glistening jewel, ready to be polished. A passion teeming with brilliance, though not yet realized.\n\nTell me, do you wish to be certified in jewelry crafting?
Many apologies, traveler, but the Xinchei-Konu is not able to take visitors at this time.
My student waits inside. I'm sure the maps we found will prove useful to his endeavors.
Za'ji proudly claimed that the Perfect Pounce could navigate any waters to reach any island. And that is true.\n\nBut no waters surround an island in the sky. Sadly, that is also true.
I'll meet you by the statue of the Forgotten Mane. It should be just south of Black Heights.
I already feel better about all this. Thank you!\n\nNow, you should talk to Governor Keshu about her plans for the battle. Find out where she wants us and what we're going to do with Sombren and the twins.
Before you light the lantern, does my hair look all right? Oh, never mind.
From the map, Blind Elegian is in his own prison within this place. He is important to Dagon, it would seem
By the Green, how did you find me, friend? No, I don't care. I'm just glad you're here.\n\nYour timing is excellent. I'm not sure I could endure another round of my gaolers' torture.
If the Imperials take Bangkorai, it will be a fatal blow to the Covenant. We can't allow Renchant to do this.\n\nDamn it. He's leaving me no choice but to take back the throne. I know Glarikha will be pleased to hear that. Where is she, by the way?
Satakal's Wrath, wayfarer … unless you will enjoy wading through an army of undead, I would go no further.\n\nThe dead have taken over Tu'whacca's Throne.
It's unusual to stand here in the open, all visible and vulnerable and everything. I've spent my life lurking in the shadows. Staying out of sight.\n\nIt's kind of nice, actually.
Ah, Raz's friend. The newest member of the Eyes of the Queen. You busy, rookie?
The Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma is on my mind. Why is it not in Dominion hands?
Good work on that last assignment. Things are quiet for now, but that never lasts. Come back and see me later. I might have something for you.
I got your word that you'd delve the Cradle of Shadows. Don't tell me you're afraid of the dark.
You activate the crystals. Look for pure light, not muddled. I'll modulate the energy fluctuations, make sure nothing explodes. If color confounds you, look at the shape. Fewest sides to most.\n\nBut the Great Gear turns, so be quick, be quick!
I'll send word to Jee-Lar and get him to meet you at the Sunless Hollow.\n\nIn the meantime, please be careful. Margus is dangerous, and what my sister has told me about the Blackguards would make your skin crawl!
The guides from the Stitches. We must be close. Saulinia had them killed because she no longer needed them and she wanted to keep whatever secrets they learned along the way.\n\nThe hidden Akaviri shrine must be nearby. Hurry, but be cautious.
Thanks for your help back there. Jubani and her thugs are a bunch of hammers who think everything is a nail. Geniuses included.\n\nAltruism isn't a thing in the Stitches. So what do you want? Need a lock picked? Something repaired?
Welcome to the House of Histories. You'll find no grander collection of curiosities and memorabilia in all of Elsweyr.\n\nI would offer you a tour, but we're currently investigating a most unfortunate theft.
If you have anything to say to our companions, I suggest you do so now. The battle ahead will be long and arduous, and we may not all survive.
Cultists? That explains some of the decoration in here.\n\nSo much for the smuggler hypothesis. I didn't expect to have to fight through a nest of cultists to extract Quistley from this mess, but so be it. What's he gotten himself mixed up in now?
I don't know what went wrong. I started praying to Mehrunes Dagon and then—the Tribunal, you, my family. I've brought shame to everyone!\n\nWe only have two stones now. We need three.
I thought Sombren was our friend. I can't believe he would do something like this. How could he turn to Mehrunes Dagon? How could he betray us?\n\nI'm so mad I can barely see straight!
Thank the Eight, I thought I'd be trapped down here for all eternity. Did the Spire send you?
I suppose it's time to reunite with Queen Ayrenn. Let's be off. \n\nMaybe this news about Prince Irnskar will keep us from wandering into more sensitive waters. She really does like to argue, that one.
There's an entrance to the Navire Dungeons in the cemetery east of Castle Navire.\n\nLet's hurry, my dear. If the Ascendant Order is planning something spectacular, I'd just as soon spoil their fun.
Careful, walker. All that swimming and fighting has made me hungry. \n\nAnd you look pretty tasty, I must say.
You should talk to Druid Fenas. He's the expert here. I think? Expert in … translations! He's helping us! Yes, you should definitely talk to him.
I-I can't believe what I'm reading …. How could Renchant be such a fool? \n\nHas he given up on defending the kingdom and decided to accept the lesser of two evils? This is simply mad.
This is the worst shut down in Sentinel's history. The city's reserves will be bone dry any day now.
Nice work. I'll train our volunteers as quick as I can.\n\n<<1>> wouldn't wait for us. He took a few of the more hot-tempered civilians and headed across the bridge. He thinks the captain is still alive.
What are you waiting for? Let's see some blood. We don't come here for the refreshments, I assure you.
I wonder, since we're basically best friends now, could you do a favor for me?
Damn you, Kharsthun! How am I supposed to make a great discovery when you—oh, hello!\n\nAre you with the House of Gory Details? The Glorious Orcs? The … oh, you know what I mean! The Orc museum! Have you brought the extra help I requested?
Are we going to help <<1>>?
I don't like the look of this, beek-ojel. I will keep my distance until you know it is safe.
Azurah guides us, child. You only need to listen.
Rigurt's favorite diplomatic assistant! How have you been? Rigurt has been busy bringing cultures together like a delicious stew made of strangers.\n\nNow Rigurt could use your help. After our past success, it would be good to work with you again.
Damn that Dragon's pride. If Nahfahlaar had only broken off and regrouped with us.\n\nIt seems we have no choice but to rescue the beast. Are you with me?
I know war preparations when I see them. Harrowstorm or no, the Gray Host is ready to march.
Whoever lived in a house this grand probably packed it with traps and secrets. Perfect! Just like a treasure hunt from the old stories.
No sign of Dockmaster Arnauld, yet plenty of evidence that something is amiss.\n\nTake a look around, please. See if you can find any clues as to where our absent dockmaster might have gotten to.
Perfect, we have everything we need. Now we just have to make the damned thing work.
I'm glad you're here. It's a relief to have someone sensible and calm to help me fix this mess. I owe you after this is all over.
Don't worry about Kalari. Just mulling what she should do next.
The dig site's not too far away. Just around the bend! One of these bends.\n\nI don't mind if you take your time. I'm just happy to be walking again.
Speak to my seneschal, Little Leaf. You'll find her to the east, along the road through the northeast passage between Upper and Lower Craglorn.\n\nI would be eternally grateful if you make sure no harm befalls her during her mission.
See that whirlpool? The currents are being drawn into the flooded ruins beneath Sea Keep. We should be able to follow them inside, just as the Sea Elves did. It's that or we drown.\n\nIf you want to back out. I understand.
You look surprised. I told you, I swim like a harpoon-fish. Typically a nap follows, but that will have to wait.\n\nYou found Jaxsik. Good. All are warned of Kassandra's treachery. Many Saxhleel come to aid us, but they will arrive too late, I think.
Come on, harrier, let's keep searching. Dwarven ruins don't find themselves, you know.
There must be something here that can tell us what's become of the vateshran.
Is that her? I wish I remembered her better. \n\nYou know, she might think I ignored the letter she sent years ago—and she might feel hurt by that. Why don't you talk to her? Ask if she's the Inalieth who once worked for the Hallix family.
I heard what Gilfrex said. It's off to the False Martyrs' Folly for this Slave Choker, I suppose. Lovely.
All right, we're here. We need to find a sturdy chopping block. It won't be pretty, but it will work for what we need.
My friend! What a turn of fate to meet you here, of all places. I didn't accidentally banish you to Amenos, did I? No, of course not. I'd remember if I saw your name on one of those prison writs.\n\nBut what are you doing here, pray tell?
Let's see what Azamel has to say. I'm not exactly optimistic about our chances of finding Song through this drunkard, but right now it's all we've got. \n\nI really hope this isn't a wild guar chase.
While we know it as All Flags Islet, it was originally referred to as Monument Islet. Intended to serve as a memorial, the place was abandoned when the undead claimed the island.\n\nThe plaques in this lighthouse tell some of the story.
What do the Firesong know that we don't? Dogs and sons of dogs. Let's not waste any more time. We have to get to Wyress Tola.\n\nDruid Laurel and I will meet you at this cave in Hag Fen with full sails and a strong wind.
This place is known as Vuldngrav, the final resting place of Korthor the Dragon Priest. Tread carefully. Where there are Dragon Priests, there are sure to be draugr.
Sir Cadwell always seems to turn up when we need him the most. Maybe he really is a knight.
Greetings, warrior. Are you ready for a mission of critical importance to the Pact?
Do you doubt if you are the predator or prey in this cautionary tale? If you are Undaunted, you know the answer. Now prove it.
You're looking for work, yeah? Good. We can use you. Folks around here have all kinds of problems that a good sellsword can solve. These contracts are piling up and my crew is booked solid.\n\nSo what do you say? Want to get your hands dirty?
As I understand it, a vampire called Lady Essenia controlled Greymoor Keep. She was working with the Gray Host to undermine Western Skyrim before you put her down.\n\nThe very stones of this keep … I sense … something. We need to be on our guard.
It's a thin hope, but if we can find Barth, he might know more about the feud between my clan and the Eagleseers.
We need to get inside and help Farrul Lupus! He sounds like he's badly injured!\n\nDo you know how to pick a lock? If not, let's see if there's an open window or something around back.
Ah. Timely as ever. What did you discover in the auction house?
Hopefully this Azamel will be willing to speak with us. Maybe you should do the talking when we find him? You're better at … people than I am. You might be able to appeal to his conscience.\n\nIf he has one, that is.
Yes, yes, we're ever so grateful. Now if you could leave us, I really do have a particular task for my manservant to take care of.
Please enjoy yourself within my Gaming Hall. Drinks, food, and games can be found throughout.\n\nIf you have any interest in learning about the game we play here, Tales of Tribute, please seek out my associate Brahgas.
I'll be able to rest soon enough, adept. Shalidor is the only reason I was able to finish. His enthusiasm and energy sustained me through this difficult trial.
If you're ready, we can use your skills, soldier.
Sahan looks relatively healthy, but there's no telling what sort of toll years of torment will take upon the mind. It will be interesting to see. \n\nI do hope we're done here. I have an assignation with a young lady.
Even the simplest contract represents a pact one enters into with the Dark Brotherhood.\n\nTake each contract seriously. After all, we built our reputation on … customer satisfaction.
You seem to have survived your visit to the Red Exiles camp. Did you find my brother?
Adara'hai has only seen one place more corrupted than this: the Temple of Seven Riddles. She prays that our foes will not possess the same strength as Rakkhat.
You waiting for me? Figured you'd take the lead, seeing as I don't know the first thing about exploring ruins. \n\nDon't worry, I'll follow close and listen for any ornery plants looking to get the drop on us.
Za'ji is beginning to think that piracy is less dangerous than politics. This one definitely chose the safer occupation.
I never thought I'd be acting on the advice of a dirty lunatic who talks to rodents. If The Rat is wrong about this Dragonfires business, I'm going to track him down and put him out of his misery.
Great day for a stroll, eh? Or, you know … a thrilling leap.
I do not want to imagine Tharn alone on that island. We must gather our forces and get back to him quickly, five-claw.\n\nI fear time is running out for all of us.
Burnt journal pages, Fenn's flask, and a strange, old key … all found among clear signs of a struggle. But other than what's in the flask, we didn't see any blood. That means Fenn was probably taken alive.
Oh, thank you, friend! Rigurt wouldn't want these thanes to think less of him for something so silly.\n\nMeet Rigurt at Jarl Morryn's hunting lodge. There, we broker a great peace treaty between Eastern and Western Skyrim!
Let's you and I split up and search the keep while Gwendis returns to Markarth. We know Lady Belain has something in mind for the city and one of us should be close at hand.\n\nInside, look for personal items. I can use them to glean information.
This all would have been much easier if Lord Silvelle hadn't concealed so much from me. I imagine he'd say that he did it for my own good, but I admit, I've got some ugly suspicions about his motives. \n\nWhat game was he playing?
Ah, my butterfly found me a strong helper!\n\nIf you're out here chasing butterflies, perhaps you have time to assist the druids of the Stonelore Circle with a matter of great importance. I'm not as young as I used to be and could use your help.
See? Father acts like I'm a burden to be locked away and dealt with later. Not an adult who has some capacity to help!\n\nHe probably told you to see if I was in my room, didn't he?
My expedition is ruined! One catastrophe after another! \n\nOh, hello. You wouldn't happen to be interested in performing a few light duties, would you? I'm in need of a temporary assistant.
Where have you been? I've been waiting for you to arrive for days now. \n\nHold on. Are you all they sent?
Are you afraid the open air will seem too much like a vacation? Do not soften your resolve. Maormer sorcery will rob the island of its charm, I promise you.
Well met, Sister. I coordinate our family's more mundane contracts. I suggest you get used to this face, because you're going to be seeing a lot of me.
Ah, friend! How good to see you again!
There has to be something around here. What's that sticking up out of the dirt over there?
You will like Chime-Maker Shuvu, I think. Very wise, and very pleasant—like one of your gray-muzzled bark-dogs.\n\nLet's make our way to the Glade.
You were on the cart. I saw you before those witches caught us and tossed me in this stone box. Glad you're finally awake.\n\nApologies for my ghastly appearance. I'm … not feeling my best.
Call out if you see anything.\n\nI don't know about you, but I can't bear the idea of disappointing Mathen. He's got it hard enough already!
Ah, the breeze carries the sweetness of your success to my senses. \n\nBut I'm afraid your work is not yet done. Before I can tell you about the blessed awl—which was unceremoniously stolen from me—you must complete one more task.
Hold still—you'll need this unless you want to spend the next few hours as a sheep. Not as glamorous as it sounds. And here, take these crystals, you'll need them to restore the wards. The first one is in the meadow just up the hill to the north.
Mannimarco. Well, it's not like we didn't see this coming. I suppose we'll have to kill him.
Search grassy areas in the wilderness for raw jute. You should find enough if you look around.
Good work! Throw the solution on the rocks, then step back and watch!
Sweet Morwha's left tit, what was that all about? Sorry for the language. But … phew! Right? Have you ever met a ghost that gorgeous? Gods, I'm sweating right through this blouse.\n\nWe should head to the Giovesse chapel and look for Mathen's armor.
Well this is unexpected. Why would a member of the Shields of Senchal wish to speak with us?\n\nBest if we see what she has to say.
Orders from Rada al-Saran. His words send a chill down my spine. Their plan for Solitude, it might even be more dreadful than an all-out attack.\n\nWe need to get back and determine the exact location of this Undergrove place.
You handled that better than I expected. Now, what in Mara's name happened to Brondold?
I've managed to conjure some elements for you to use on the End Times ash tree.\n\nNow you just need it to sprout new seeds.
You there! I hate to impose, but I'm in something of a pickle and could use a modicum of assistance.\n\nDo you happen to have any experience dealing with ancient curses?
Hallowed. I take it you've restored order to the Merchants District?
We use this hut as a gathering place of sorts. For now, I suppose. Nothing lasts forever out here in the marsh.\n\nIf Eshraf or Dinia got into trouble, they'd definitely come here. Maybe they were here and left something behind?
Remember to avoid the Sul-Xan. But keep an eye out for the Waking Flame cultists. I wouldn't be surprised if we run into them before too long.\n\nNow, let's go find the pit of the outsider!
No messages for you right now, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear otherwise.
As with master chefs, every alchemist must assemble the right components before crafting a special concoction. Are you so capable? We shall see.\n\nI require you to locate a solvent and some reagents. Then, you shall craft me a potion.
It worked! Sorry if that sounds too much like surprise, but I couldn't be sure that would be enough to save Eolaf's life until we tried it.\n\nIf the cult is doing this to the others, we should be able to free them too. If we're careful.
Well, here's a turn of luck! It's me! Revus! You helped me out of a scrape in Gnisis some time back. Remember? Kwama mine, tonal resonator … devoured bard. Good times.\n\nAnyway, here we are again. You, me, and an experiment going poorly.
Stendarr help me, she's an adventurer now. You'd better talk to her, my friend.
Today's pledge is not for you. Come back tomorrow.
Here—you can read the letter for yourself, if you're curious. I wonder what sort of mess Quistley's managed to get himself into this time?
Untie her, quick. I'll keep watch for more pirates.
Your command of the craft is impressive, but not yet in totality. I am still capable of instructing you.
Please, friend, please! Look all you like, spend freely, spend it all!
Let me know if you have some time. I can train and certify you in something else!
In a bazaar, this is known as a lull. In a store, this is a crowd. For us, this is a good time to pursue individual sales, yes?
I'm not entirely comfortable with Julles and Galedra taking justice into their own hands. \n\nBut they're not the murderous type, it seems. I suppose Stendarr would approve.
I am so sorry, this was supposed to be a quick trip to Stros M'Kai. \n\nNow we're running off to Craglorn after a thieving skeever with my family's signet ring.
I heard, I heard. Typical Telvanni. \n\nIf we have to get him his damned bracelet, let's just do it fast. He said Varvisi Uleni sells outside Tel Naga, right? Let's go. I've got a plan brewing.
My friend, I am not in the habit of asking for favors. But … well. I just got some news from Aurelia. \n\nYou remember her, my childhood friend we helped during the tourney?
I don't like standing around. Let's get to it, shall we? Magister Irin used to say it was dangerous to leave me idle for too long.

Balfiera Defender Armor
When evaluating armor, the base stat is Armor. Armor with a higher Armor Stat will provide more protection and better damage mitigation against physical attacks. Some armor has Enchantment, Trait, and Set Bonuses that further increase their effectiveness in battle and grant your character special bonuses while that armor type is equipped. \n\nEquipping and using armor will increase your skill with that armor type over time, unlocking new abilities that can be used when that armor type is equipped.
To use the Looking For Group tool when you are not currently in a group, press the <<1>> key to open your Group Menu, then click on the Dungeon Finder or Alliance War options located in the left column of the menu.
If your character becomes stuck, you may use the console command |cFFFFFF/stuck|r to become unstuck.
Bruma, Cropsford, and Vlastarus are towns within Cyrodiil that can be captured. This offers players new, safe locations to respawn when slain.\n\nThese towns also feature specialized equipment vendors, offering elite level gear.
ESO Plus is a paid membership service that permits full access to DLC game packs along with other in-game bonuses.
When ESO Plus members allow their memberships to lapse, they can still take advantage of limited aspects of their former benefits.\n\nWhen an ESO Plus membership ends, access to game DLC, Costume Dyeing, and the 10% Bonuses are revoked, however, limited access to the Craft Bag, Double Bank Space, Double Transmute Crystal Capacity, and Double Home Furnishing Capacity remains.
Reap additional rewards for overcoming the challenges of Fang Lair and Scalecaller Peak by completing Daily Pledges for the Undaunted!\n\nAdventurers of level 45 and up who have joined the Undaunted Guild can accept these pledges by traveling to the Undaunted Enclaves in each of the three Alliance Capitals. Speak to Urgarlag Chief-bane for pledges related to DLC content.
Storage furnishings can be placed in a home and used to access a set amount of personal storage by the owner. As collectibles, only one instance of each storage collectible may be placed per home, though it may be placed in every home. \n\nTo use a storage furnishing, first travel to your home, and navigate to the Storage section of the Services category of the housing editor to place your collectible. Once you've placed a storage furnishing, you can interact with it in your home to deposit or withdraw items from that particular collectible. Each one has its own storage, separate from all other item storage. Unlike bank storage, ingredients stored in chests and coffers will not be used when crafting, and stored equipment will not appear in deconstruction, research, or upgrade windows at crafting stations.\n\nStorage collectibles may be acquired from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator for Master Writs, from any Tel Var General Merchant, or from the Crown Store. You may also acquire a single unique Storage Collectible from the Level Up Rewards system.
Reap additional rewards for overcoming the challenges of Frostvault and Depths of Malatar by completing Daily Pledges for the Undaunted!\n\nAdventurers of level 45 and up who have joined the Undaunted Guild can accept these pledges by traveling to the Undaunted Enclaves in each of the three Alliance Capitals. Speak to Urgarlag Chief-bane for pledges related to DLC content.
The Morrowind Celebration commemorates the Morrowind Chapter of The Elder Scrolls Online. During this event, you can earn the following rewards by participating in various activities throughout the Vvardenfell zone:\n\n•	Double reward drops for defeating any Boss \n•	Double rewards from Daily and Weekly quests\n•	Double harvesting resources from regular crafting nodes
The Alliance War feature in the |cFFFFFFGroup & Activity Finder|r helps you join groups while in Cyrodiil or Imperial City. This makes it easier for you to find other players and form groups in the chaos of the Alliance war.\n\nTo use the Alliance War group finder, you must be in Cyrodiil or Imperial City. Press the <<1>> key to open your |cFFFFFFGroup & Activity Finder|r, then click on |cFFFFFFAlliance War|r located in the left column of the menu. From the drop down in the upper right, select |cFFFFFFCyrodiil|r or |cFFFFFFImperial City|r. Click the |cFFFFFFJoin Queue|r button to be queued to join a group.
Both reviled and feared by the people of Tamriel, necromancers are masters of the dark arts. While most spellcasters study in well-lit libraries and guild halls, necromancers delve deep into forbidden tomes and crumbling mausoleums, pushing the boundaries of magical praxis in secret. With practice and fierce application of will, these grim mages can reanimate skeletons, summon ghostly thralls, and channel souls' arcane power into terrifying spells that both harm and heal. The necromancer's power over life and death is absolute. Those fools who stand against them in life will surely serve them in death.
Greymoor was the 2020 Chapter.\n\nThe dark heart of Skyrim beats below the surface of Western Skyrim. As High King Svargrim clings to power over the western kingdom of the Nords, terrible storms rage across the land, turning his people into bloodthirsty fiends. Join the hero Lyris Titanborn and the Ravenwatch vampire Fennorion as they uncover the secrets and conspiracies that threaten Western Skyrim.
Vampire is a unique skill line you can acquire. The Vampire Skill Line grants access to powerful Active and Passive Skills that can be used alongside your other Skills, but comes at a terrible price - your character will be afflicted with Vampirism.\n\nTo obtain the Vampire Skill Line, you must become infected by special Vampire monsters that are only active during certain times of the day and in certain locations. You can also have another player infect you with Vampirism, though this must be done at a special Vampire ritual site.\n\nYou can cure Vampirism at any time by finding a Priest of Arkay in major cities, but this removes access to the Vampire Skill Line. You can re-obtain the Skill Line again later and your progress will be preserved.
The first step in uncovering an Antiquity is Scrying for it. Gazing into the Antiquarian's Eye will allow you to expand your awareness and mystically search for these hidden treasures.\n\nIn order to Scry for an Antiquity, you must be in the same Zone as the Antiquity, and you must have a relevant Lead (if the Antiquity requires it).\n\nTo begin Scrying, open your Codex and select the Antiquity you wish to Scry for from the Scryable list. (If the Antiquity does not appear on that list, you cannot Scry for it.) Once you've made your selection, you'll be taken to a view of the Antiquarian's Eye.
The Unstable Morpholith is a pet collectible that can be earned in game.\n\nCollecting the Deadlands Flint, Rune-Etched Striker, and Smoldering Bloodgrass Tinder unlocks the associated collectible fragments viewable within the Collections menu. Once you have all 3 fragments unlocked, you can combine them in that menu to perform the summoning ritual. This will consume all three fragments and unlock the Unstable Morpholith pet.
Companions come equipped with their own basic gear. They have their own abilities and limited skill line progression, based on their background. You can configure and customize their active abilities through the Companion Menu. Companions can have multiple combat abilities pre-slotted into their active bar. They can also have a racial passive ability and a non-combat bonus. \n\nA companion gains experience by fighting and killing mobs. The experience awarded to your companion is based on how much you receive when an enemy dies. (Your companion's experience does not reduce the amount of experience you receive.) Leveling up a companion makes them more powerful. It also unlocks additional ability slots and new abilities, including an Ultimate ability.
Overview\nThe Armory is a new way to save and quickly switch between character load outs for free. An Armory Slot consists of Attributes, Actives/Passive Abilities, Equipped Items, Champion Points, Vampire/Werewolf Curse, Quickslot Setup, Mundus Stones, and an Outfit slot. Each Character starts with two Armory Slots and can buy up to eight more from the Crown Store. \n\nAccessing the Armory\nPlayers can access the Armory by interacting with any Armory Station or Armory Assistant. Each player can get the Armory Station collectible for free from Crown Store under Services -> Crafting Stations. Players can then place this collectible in their homes to interact with it. Armory Stations can be found in all three Alliance bases in the Imperial City sewers, as well as at the Northern High Rock Gate, the Southern Morrowind Gate, and the Western Elsweyr Gate in Cyrodiil. Players may also spend Crowns to get an Armory Assistant Collectible from the Crown Store.\n\nUsing the Armory \nOpening the Armory will lead to a list of all the player's Armory Slots. From here players can choose to equip, save over, or rename an Armory Slot.  \n\nEquipping an Armory Slot will replace all the player's active Attributes, Actives/Passive Abilities, Equipped Items, Champion Points, Vampire/Werewolf Curse, Quickslot Setup, Mundus Stones, and an Outfit slot on the player's character with the contents of the chosen Armory Slot. Any gear swapped out will go into the player's bag. Note that if any gear in a build is no longer in that character's bag it will not be equipped.\n\nTo save a build to an Armory Slot, open the Armory and select which slot to save over. The character's current build will be stored in that slot and can be reequipped in the future through the Armory Station or Armory Assistant. \n\nWith the Armory open, players can also rename any Armory Slots and assign an icon of their choice.
The Season of the Dragon Celebration is a commemoration of the 2019 content year. During this event, you can earn special rewards by participating in various activities in Northern or Southern Elsweyr, or the Frostvault, Depths of Malatar, Moongrave Fane, and Lair of Maarselok dungeons!\n\n•	Extra rewards for defeating Dragons, Group Boss, and Delve Boss enemies\n•	Extra yield from harvesting nodes in either area\n•	Extra rewards for completing Delve, Group Boss, and Dragonguard daily quests\n• Extra rewards for defeating  bosses within the Sunspire Trial\n• Extra rewards for defeating bosses within the Frostvault, Depths of Malatar, Moongrave Fane, and Lair of Maarselok dungeons\n\n|c000000|cFFFFFFReward Boxes|r\nCompleting your first daily quest in Northern or Southern Elsweyr will award a Glorious Elsweyr Coffer, which contains valuable rewards, including a chance to obtain style pages for the new Claw-Dance Acolyte Armor Style.\n\nAdditionally, you can find rare Elsweyr Coffers by participating in activities within Northern or Southern Elsweyr. These coffers can have similar rewards, but with less chance of dropping certain high-tier items.

Wait! Come back!
Please! They need help. You must help them!
Hail! Are you going up to the ruins?
I'm worried about Murk-Watcher.
If you're willing, I might ask for one other favor?
My regret binds me to this place.
Someone has to stand up to these Red Rook villains.
There you are!
Praise Vivec! An ally. Help me, child.
Did you bring troops?
Quietly, there is danger!
Hissmir must be notified about recent events in Murkwater.
What will we do?
Hmm. Yes, that's just in line with the third law of arcanodynamics. Excellent.
I wish the others would return already.
These cultists are everywhere
You there! You don't look like an abomination against the Divines.
Help! Over here! I need you!
Come on, Raynor. You can do this. You're a genius, after all.
I could use your help, friend.
One problem under control. On to the next.
Stop, in the name of the king!
Time grows short. What to do? What to do?
The Captain will want to hear about this.
We've got to close these portals.
No! How could they? Such evil.
Leave me be, you cowardly bastards! You can't have me or my buried treasure!
Such a lovely day for a stroll past Mathiisen.
Stop a moment, please.
I'm going to flay that fool Orc alive!
Hey! You there! Be a friend and get me out of here.
You're alive! That's wonderful! Can we talk?
What am I going to do? Mother's gonna kill me.
No pirate will make it past me!
If the dreugh attack again, we're all dead.
Stay on your toes, friend.
Careful on the road here. Highwaymen attack the unwary.
Hold! Speak to me before entering Mournhold, citizen.
We should have never come to this awful place.
Feluz! Feluz! Where is that stupid cat?
Tazia deserves better than this. She's a good person.
Is anyone there? Help me, please!
blah
Dark Moons, this is a mess.
Hold, friend. I would warn you.
I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
By the Light of Aetherius! There you are!
Where can he be?
I really hate hay. I could live forever and never smell hay again.
My father told me someone would come.
Am I hallucinating?
Please, you must help me save Stibbons!
Over here!
Please, the alliance leaders are waiting.
I've lost a fortune in this mine!
Withered Hand, Imperials, … what's next?
You there, please. You must help me.
Come, speak with your Skald-King!
Watch out for the Imperial archers!
Um … I can't do my job. Not with all this going on!
Please. Have mercy. Let me explain.
Dethisam, lie down! You need to rest.
Impeccable timing. Razum-dar's luck strikes again.
Curse these Scaled Court vermin! A wellspring of research beneath our feet, and they're tearing it apart. I wish there was someone around who could stop them.
Reikrs aren't usually that much trouble, but these were organized.
Hold, outsider. I bring a message from the king.
I sure wish Master Dren was here.
Malacath, we have failed you!
Over here.
This way.
Remember history or repeat the mistakes of the past.
So many new faces … oh, another one! You there! Speak with your king.
The attentive bird catches the worm, crow-friend.
Did you hear that weeping again? I've had enough of this place ….
Someone with flesh on their bones! Thank Mauloch.
No, that won't do. The color must be vibrant!
A thousand pardons, but the Battlereeve requires your prompt appearance at the Proxy Queen's court.
Friend of Valsirenn. I have a proposal for you.
These curs think they can break me?
Gold for favors! Over here!
Come. We have much to discuss.
Make whatever preparations you must, Famia. The time has come.
How dare they take Seeks like that! Oh, whatever am I going to do ….
There you are. Took you long enough.
To fight Dragons, we must first fight Daedra? Of course.
Five-claw, a moment, please.
Psst, five-claw! This one has a message for you.
I have a task for you, hunter.
You there! Please! I need help!
Wait, but what do I see? Brave soul, a word!
Hey, partner. Let's talk.
Please, can anybody help us?
What are you doing down here, Rada?
Damn the Thornroot clan! Damn them all!
You! I've been looking for you.
Leave it to an outsider to bring a curse down upon a sacred shrine ….
Yes, yes, my vision-dream speaks true! You are the one my mistress seeks!
I should sail out of here and never look back.
Hail, wayfarer ….
Adventurer, let us speak.
Come, mortal, we have much to discuss.
Mortal! Heed me!
Hey, over here!

The Imperial province of Cyrodiil dominates central Tamriel. With the Empire's collapse, armies of the Dominion, Covenant, and Pact have all invaded Cyrodiil, vying for the Imperial throne and control of the greatest prize in the land.
Once the subterranean temple beneath Eidolon's Hollow was one of the holiest sites of Chimer worship of the Good Daedra. But it was long ago forsaken by the Elves of Morrowind when they turned their devotion to the Living Gods of the Tribunal.
Redguard tradition holds that when the souls of great warriors travel on to the Far Shores, they live forever in honor and glory in the Hall of Heroes.
The burial crypts of the noble Dres family, one of the Great Houses of the Dark Elves, were excavated beneath Kragenmoor in the middle of the First Era by Argonian and Khajiiti slaves.
The Dwarven ruins of Mzithumz are well known to house constructs and automatons that are still active and mobile—which makes them far too dangerous to enter as far as the locals are concerned, despite the resale value of Dwarven mechanisms and parts.
Scholars of the ancient Dwemer believe the buried city of Mzulft was built as some sort of vast dedicated manufacturing site—but dedicated to what, no one is quite sure. Based on the number of traps and constructs defending it, the Dwarves clearly considered it vital.
Windhelm, like most Nord cities, has a Hall of the Dead where bodies are interred, overseen by a Priest of Orkey who ensures that corpses are properly consecrated and cared for.
Morachellis Hag-Husband speculated that a troll's third eye was used to view, not the mundane world, but the overworld of spirits coterminous with our own. However, Morachellis also believed that horkers grew into mammoths, and that fire could be classed as a beverage.
Is Mauloch the Aedra different from Malacath the Daedra, or are they a single entity, cast out by both groups of Divines? No one can agree as to the truth of the matter—not even the Orcs.
Once known simply as Northern Valenwood, this region that borders Cyrodiil and Elsweyr has seen so much bloody warfare since the fall of the Second Empire that it's now known as Reaper's March, even to its battle-scarred inhabitants.
The Errinorne Academy was destroyed when the Sload sacked Skywatch in 1E 1301 and never rebuilt, as its island location was thereafter deemed indefensible. But now the ruined halls of the academy's great library have been reoccupied.
Most Nords find dealings with the Daedra to be abhorrent, so when Molag Bal has an opportunity to collect the soul of a notable Nord, it is a chance to be savored. Such was the case with Haman Forgefire.
Soul Shriven who collaborate with their guards and inform on their fellows may be rewarded with a shift of lighter labor—or even a visit to the Grotto of Depravity.
The strange vaulted halls of Taarengrav Barrow are ancient indeed—possibly as old as Saarthal or Labyrinthian. Certainly to modern eyes, this barrow was constructed on no logical plan. Perhaps its arrangement has a mystic significance.
The Green Pact, the Spinners say, contains its own punishment for those who turn their back on it. Such apostates become the Accursed of Y'ffre, doomed to haunt lost corners of the Green until they find a way to redeem themselves.
These winding tunnels were once home to a thriving fungus-farming operation. But since war has come to Cyrodiil, they've been put to darker uses.
The Goblins of the Valus Mountains are said to go back and forth between Cyrodiil and Morrowind using tunnels and secret passes. Some tribes have imported subterranean agricultural practices from their cousins to the east.
Scholars who study the long-lost Dwarven race love to speculate on the original purposes of abandoned Dwemer sites. None of them have any credible ideas as to the function of the mysterious Deeping Drome.
One of the first landfalls settled by the Redguards when they sailed east from their lost homeland of Yokuda, the island of Stros M'Kai is now a haven for freebooters, sea-rovers, and other nautical entrepreneurs who roam the Abecean Sea.
According to the Spinners in Marbruk, these cliffs were once inhabited by a flock of the rare, and possibly extinct, cockatiel harpies. They were said to kidnap young male hunters as mates, thus the saying about the lovestruck, "He's carried off to Harridan's."
Meridia's many-faceted realm is known as the Colored Rooms. She is said to have formed it out of the chaos of Oblivion by an act of sheer divine will.
The Elden Trees of Valenwood, a titanic species of graht-oak, are among the oldest living things on Tamriel. They are revered as focal points of the essence of the Green.
The series of caves known as Nikolvara's Kennel have long been home to wild packs of durzogs, but nearby residents now complain that the place has been overrun with the creatures.
This complex was clearly built by Ayleids, the ancient Wild Elves of Cyrodiil. After St. Alessia's slave revolt, some Ayleid clans fled to northwest Tamriel, but whatever group excavated these halls disappeared long ago.
Building the massive walls and towers of the new city of Orsinium requires a great deal of stone. Much of it comes from the Tumnosh clan's rich quarry and its newly discovered depths.
The refuge below Rawl'kha is the haunt of the Darkmoon Prowlers, an "All-Khajiiti Gang" … which means they'll admit non-Khajiiti members, but only if they agree to wear a cat-mask.
The major cultures of Tamriel are thousands of years old, and for all those millennia the wealthy and important have been burying their dead in underground tombs. Over time, some of these have been forgotten—or turned to other uses.
The Gold Coast always served as the Empire of Cyrodiil's gateway to the Abecean Sea—but with the Empire in eclipse, the region has gone its own way.
You want privacy? What could be more private than lost and forgotten Nedic ruins in a remote corner of Craglorn's backcountry? Especially recommended for overthrown despots, retired master assassins, and Ministers of Finance exiled for embezzling.
Whatever this colossal onyx shard may be, one thing is certain: it comes from somewhere beyond the bounds of Tamriel. And the fabric of Tamriel may not be strong enough to contain its power.
Even if you don't personally have a taste for the famous fire-pit dancing at the Flaming Nix, you have to admit it adds a certain cachet to having a room there. Not to mention an unusual fragrance.
"For the Mainspring Ever-Wound is the Father of Curiosity, and curiosity is the joyful destroyer. Only in sundering can things be made whole. Only the disassembled engine can be scrubbed and made clean. So smash the old machines! Topple your mind's idols! And from the wreckage, assemble new truths."
A key fortification on Summerset's oft-invaded northern coast, Cey-Tarn Keep frowns out across the Sea of Pearls toward the distant Thrassian Archipelago and its vile race of Sload, eternal enemies of the High Elves of the isles.
"Mephala! Webspinner! Teacher of the Secret Arts! Queen of the Eight Shadows of Murder! Though others may reign over us, deep in the night we still hear your whisper! And we do not forget." —The Derisive Necromite
The foundations of Summerset Isle have been firm and unchanging for millennia, and phenomena like sinkholes have been rare and infrequent—until quite recently.
The ancient coral foundations of Summerset Isle are never more apparent than in the half-sunken grottoes so common among the seashore cliffs. They often serve as lairs for creatures, both nautical and mystical.
The Aerie of the Altmer, the city of Cloudrest clings to the highest slopes of the peak of Eton Nir, tallest mountain on Summerset Isle. Somehow, its thin air is as heady and bracing as chilled nirnroot wine.
These vast subterranean vaults have stood in Southern Elsweyr since before the beginning of recorded history, but no one knows who built them or why. At least one section of the Halls seems to have been occupied or used by other parties in the interim.
A hidden storehouse of Imperial treasures used by the Longhouse Emperors. Many such locations were secreted away throughout the Empire, and most of them feature magical protections to safeguard their contents.
"We avoid the barrow outside Morthal. It's haunted, don't you know? The jarl even makes us patrol the area on a regular basis because the ancient dead have a habit of getting up and walking around. Very uncalled for, but things like that happen. That's why we're always prepared."—Swordthane Enyra
"Netherroot, a rare and exotic plant. It can only be found in Blackreach, and even then only in select locations. Fortunately, I have obtained a bountiful supply. A place called the Undergrove, in the heart of the Midnight Barrow."—Exarch Tzinghalis
"Thus the stones are laid. The foundation of our immortal rule. They were given the chance to join with us. Are we responsible for those who refuse our gift?" — Rada al-Saran
"It was there in the darkness that Lorkh understood. Nothing does not exist. Where there is nothing there is possibility. And so he found a space in the Void where all that is could be." —Vateshran Eoinola
Often swallowed by the rising tides of Topal Bay, Tidewater Cave provides a popular haunt for Blackwood's many muck-covered beasts. Explorers who don't drown in its cavernous depths often meet their end in a creature's maw.
"The veil separating Mundus from Oblivion is remarkably thin in some places. What people often fail to grasp is that the border separating one Oblivion realm from another can be just as permeable."—Divayth Fyr
"Gazmod the Collector's villa on the west side of the city features a wide array of Dagonic relics—probably the best in all of Fargrave. They have an eye for those sorts of things."—Madam Whim
Fort Grief sits on an island at the mouth of the Silverfish River in Niben Bay. While it once was a thriving command center for the Imperial Legion, it fell into disuse and disrepair near the end of the First Era and has rarely been occupied since.
"Where do the spirits of nature that sustain our grove reside? All around, of course. But if they have a true home, it is beneath our feet, in the Undergrove."—Archdruid Agathie
Deep within the passages of the Sunken Road lies a ritual site, one that supposedly houses a spirit meant to sleep until "the barons in ivy robes" need them most.

Select the activity type and location of the content you wish to play with a group from the pull down menus. Only content appropriate to your character will be selectable. Press the <<1>> key to begin searching.
Crown Tri-Restoration Potions are best used from your character's Quickslot.
To dye a costume or hat, simply interact with an Outfit Station and select the "Costume and Hat Dying icon" |t48:48:EsoUI/Art/Tutorial/pc_costumeDye.dds|t to open the interface.\n\n|cFFFFFFNote:|r Non-ESO Plus Members can only dye their costumes and hats by purchasing Dye Stamps sold in the Crown Store.
Completing achievements can provide lots of different rewards\n• Dyes to color your equipment\n• Titles\n• Cosmetic Collectibles\n• Ability to purchase rare homes and furnishings for gold
When you arrive, pick up The Return of Alkosh quest from Moon-Bishop Azin-jo. The quest is repeatable so you can experience Sunspire as often as you like but remember, you can only receive the rewards from this quest once per week.\n\nPlayers can compete for fame and glory on the Trials Leaderboards.
Seasoned Undaunted and other explorers who seek the thrill of a new challenge, join ranks with three of your peers and face the dangers and mysteries of two new dungeons: Lair of Maarselok and Moongrave Fane.
Event Tickets\nDuring the Tribunal Celebration, you can earn one Event Tickets every 24 hours per account as a reward for the first daily quest you complete in both Vvardenfell and Clockwork City, for a total of two per day. You can trade these tickets for special items at the Event Merchant (The Impresario), including fragments for the new Unstable Morpholith pet and its morphs.
Over the course of a match, players take turns acquiring cards from the Tavern, gaining the favor of deck patrons, and accruing Prestige—the resource that determines victory in the match. The player who reaches forty Prestige or gains the favor of all four patrons wins.\n\nYou must visit the Gonfalon Gaming Hall and complete your training with Brahgas and Master Razhamad before you can engage in Tales of Tribute play.
Another useful skill is understanding the order in which combos are resolved. The order that you activate your cards every turn triggers their effects and combos accordingly. When playing a card, its play effects are resolved first, followed by any combos on the card itself, and then any combos on other cards that were triggered. Combos on other cards are resolved by their play order with cards that were played earlier being triggered first.\n\nBefore activating your cards, consider what abilities you wish to trigger first. For example, if you have a toss and draw ability, you may wish to activate the toss ability first so you can choose what cards to send to the cooldown pile before activating your draw ability.

Honor and service!
Help me turn my luck?

Many thanks.
I'm free...and in your debt!
Yes?
It's good to see you!
Honor and service!
I would be pleased to serve you.
I have many fine goods!
You again?
What is it?
I'm wounded! I'm...down...
Good hunting.
Things go from bad to worse.
Nice to see you again!
I don't need much...
Release me!
The injustice of it all...
The injustice of it all...
Let me out!
The room is spinning!

My grief is without end.
I...I can't move.
<Groan>
Hello there.
Welcome!
It's been awhile.

<Nightmare mumble>
Ah, it's you.
Free at last! My thanks!
How can I help you?
How can I help you?
<sigh> Again?
Well?
Hello again!
Customers are always welcome!
Help me get back on my feet?
Help me get back on my feet?
Help me get back on my feet?
Hello again.
Hello again!
Have we met? I don't remember...
Have we met? I don't remember...
Hail.
Can you lend some help?
Can you lend some help?
Feel...so faint...
It's good you're back.
Hail.
What do you want?
Curse my lot.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Anything I can do for you?
Need something?
Move along.
What do you want now?
I always forgive my enemies, but I remember their names.
Getting old is no picnic, but the alternative is a lot worse.
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
Lorkhan take you!
Oh! You startled me!
What?
For the love of Stendarr!
I beg of you...
Let me go!
It's you.
<Groan>
I'm in trouble here...
I've got a problem...
<Groan>
I've lost hope.
I've lost hope.
It's you!
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
What can I help you with?
Open for business!
What?
What?
I'll be at this until I drop.
This is taking forever.
Welcome back.
Welcome back!
This is just...awful.
Look at the shape I'm in...
<Snore>
Spare a coin for the needy?
Why carry on?
Someone...
<Groan>
What?
<Groan>
<Groan>

Well?
<sigh> Again?
Hm?
I hope to be done here soon.
Don't let me rot here!
Help me!
Ah, it's you!
Come have a drink with me!
Come have a drink with me!
Hm?
Help me...please!
<sigh> Again?
Hope is a foolish fancy.
Ah, it's you!
<Nightmare mumble>
How can I help you?
Think twice before you cross me.
Hm?
Well?
Don't leave me...
I fear the worst.
What do you want?
This is taking forever.
Yes?
I don't feel so well...
<Groan>
Is that...really you?
Ahh, such pain...
Ahh, such pain...
Curse my lot.
Yes?
Hello again!
Feel...so faint...
<Snore>
Yes?
Customers are always welcome!
What do you want?
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
What do you want?
It's you! Well, well!
I beg of you...
I beg of you...
A brief rest, that's all I ask.
I don't seem to be making much progress.
It's you. Well, well.
My captivity is undeserved.
Hello there.
Just in time! My glass is empty.
It *is* you.
<Groan>
I need your help.
I need your help.
<Groan>
It'll take more than this to kill me.
What?
<Groan>
<Snore>
May I be of service?
What?
Well, well!
Seeking a haven for your assets?
A mug of local brown mazte?
This isn't right!
Well, well!
<Groan>
This is just...awful.
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Snore>
What do you want?
You have returned.
Why carry on?
What?
A sacrifice must be made at midnight.
I'm just...livid!
More drink over here!
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>

Ah, it's you!
Ah, it's you!
How can I help you?

I hope to be done here soon.
Don't let me rot here!
You've got the wrong one!
You've got the wrong one!
Ah, it's you!
I know your scent.
Ah, it's you.
Ah, it's you.
Hm?
My troubles overwhelm me.
Ah, it's you!
I'd hoped to be better by your return.
<Snore>
Keep your claws in.
<sigh> Again?
I'm feeling strong enough now.
I told you I'd pull through.
Hello again!
Customers are always welcome!
Keeping myself busy, here.
I prayed someone would come.
Let them have it!
Wait for it!
I don't belong here!
I don't deserve this!
Yes?
Feel...so faint...
Move out!
Hello again!
Curse my lot.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
Farewell.
<Scream>
It's you! Well, well!
I beg of you...
Quick, help me escape!
My captivity is undeserved.
Let me go!
<Groan>
This watch is endless. Where's my relief?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Hello there.
May I be of service?
May this one be of service?
What?
What?
This one is not superstitous. That brings bad luck.
<Scream>
It's not that much to ask.
This is taking forever.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Welcome back!
This is just...awful.
Look at the shape I'm in...
Well, well.
Do you seek improvement?
Welcome back.
As mud is my mother, I will avenge that day!
We should throw dice for gold. Interested?
Spare a coin for the needy?
<Snore>
In the market for something?
What?
I will recite the invocation.
<Snore>
Speak with me a moment.
Speak with me a moment.
There's a way in through the sewers. He drew me a map.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Are you immune to fear?
I haven't eaten in so long...
Hm?
A familiar face.
It was...the other guy!
It was...the other guy!
Greetings.
A familiar face.
<Groan>
It's an honor to serve the Ebonheart Pact, as long as their gold is good.
You're back! Thank Stendarr!
No.
A familiar face!
A thousand lamentations!
Death begins to look good.
A thousand lamentations!
You're back! Thank Stendarr!
Thank you.
A familiar face!
Can I help you?
We'll have no disturbances here.
A familiar face.
<sigh> Again?
Bowstring broke. That's bad luck, that is.
I owe you.
Hurry now...
Hurry now...
What do you want?
I'm rather busy right now.
Yes?
I've got to get out of here!
Hear me out...please!
Good to see you.
Anywhere south of Falkreath is too warm for my blood.
Are you here to help?
<Nightmare mumble>
What do you want now?
Yes?
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
I'm well enough to fight.
To Oblivion with you!
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
Something I can do for you?
What brings you?
What is it?
Gold may be the root of evil, but we all need roots.
What is it?
What is it?
Ah! I just opened a new barrel!
They've got no proof!
Over here! I need help!
<Groan>
Oh, pitiful me...
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
Have you come to barter?
Don't be offended. He hates everyone.
Flagon of ale?
And we couldn't...stop...laughing!
So...cold...
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
Only I need to know the whole plan.
<Groan>
Can anyone assist me?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Well?
<sigh> Again?
A familiar face!
A familiar face!
Hey, deep-pockets! Spare a coin?
Are you going to free me?
Fire!
It was...that other Orc!
Greetings.
Buy me another bucketful?
Aren't you going to introduce me to your twin?
Come at me!
I've got a hangover the size of Cyrodiil.
A familiar face.
Help me!
Help me!
A familiar face!
I see my ancestors before me.
I'm no better. Maybe worse.
<Snore>
<Snore>
Greetings.
A familiar face.
Hm?
Well?
Well?
Who drank the last of the mead?
Am I too quick for you?
Hurry now...
Good to see you!
Have mercy...
Have mercy...
I'm rather busy right now.
I've got to get out of here!
Good to see you.
Hail.
Yes?
Hey! Grab a drink!
Aid me...please!
I'm...hanging on.
Life has become a burden.
Life has become a burden.
Good to see you!
Hail.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
What do you want now?
Mauloch curse you!
Ah, you're back!
Something I can do for you?
How may I serve?
Help someone in need?
Can anybody help me!
Just hear my side of the story!
Now who's got a drink for me. You?
<Groan>
<Groan>
I haven't much longer...
What is it?
I'm at my wit's end.
Something I can do for you?
<Groan>
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
If you're looking for trouble, you've found it.
Be quick, or be gone!
So, you're back!
So much to do.
This is all a horrible mistake!
They've got no proof!
So, you're back!
So, you're back.
Oh, pitiful me...
Oh, pitiful me...
Well, look who's back!
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
Do you seek trade?
What is that terrible smell? It's making me hungry.
Can't you see that I'm furious?
This isn't a good time...
Please, I need to buy food.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Do you see something you like?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
I will perform the Daedric summoning.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
I erect the spine of fear.
<sigh> Again?
Can I help you?
Can I help you?
A familiar face.
A familiar face.
It was...that other man!
Hm?
<Groan>
A familiar face.
A dark fate pursues this one!
A familiar face!
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Well?
<sigh> Again?
Well?
<sigh> Again?
Well?
If I die, I'm taking those scaleless milk-suckers with me!
I told you I'd make it.
Alright...I'm with you now!
Good to see you!
Good to see you!
Good to see you.
I didn't do it, I tell you!
Get yourself a drink...and one for me!
Good to see you.
Death would be a relief...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Yes?
Good to see you.
I'm in your debt.
How might I be of assistance?
Keep moving.
Stay out of trouble.
What do you want now?
I cannot complain, but that does not seem to stop me.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Do not fuel my wrath.
I know that face!
To serve is my privilege.
Help someone in need?
Help someone in need?
Look into my eyes...I'm innocent!
Hello.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Bad things come to those who break the law.
I haven't much longer...
What is it?
I'm at my wit's end.
<Snore>
How may I serve?
Only the finest wares here!
What is it?
Can't you see that I'm furious?
I'm down on my luck...help me out?
So much to do.
So, you've returned.
So, you're back!
<Groan>
Well, look who's back.
I'm...burning up.
<Snore>
What do you want?
I must warn you, I'm in a foul mood.
Please, I need to buy food.
<Groan>
So...cold...
What will become of me?
Help me!
<Snore>
Ready to trade?
Of course crime pays. Otherwise there'd be no crime.
<Groan>
Please...somebody...come to my aid!
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Now what?
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
Hurry now...release me!
I didn't do anything!
Hm?
Hail.
<Groan>
Hm?
Back again?
I need help!
Back again?
Can anyone help?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Buying? Selling? I've got what you need!
Now what?
What do you want?
Hang on...
Stars light your way.
Yes?
There's a familiar sight!
Need some assistance?
Help me...I'm desperate.
Yes?
I'm sure glad to see you.
There's a familiar sight.
You're back! Let's drink to it!
<Groan>
I must find some help.
I hope you can help me...
I hope you can help me...
You again?
You're back! I feared I wouldn't last.
<Snore>
<Snore>
Tell me what you need.
What is it?
What is it?
I tried to read that book. The covers were too far apart.
What is it?
You again?
What is it?
What?
Don't cross me.
Safe travels, I hope!
I wasn't always a beggar.
Someone will pay for this.
Hello there.
What're we drinking to?
Welcome, again.
Look who's here.
Hello there.
What?
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Safe travels, I hope.
I never tell the truth to those unworthy of it.
I never tell the truth to those unworthy of it.
Keep it down. You'll wake the dead!
Are you going to add to my problems?
<Groan>
<Groan>
What hope is there?
<Groan>
You return.
I've just about had it.
I believe I'll have another.
Why must I suffer?
Why must I suffer?
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Won't anybody help me?
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Aren't you afraid?

Aren't you afraid?
Aren't you afraid?
What can I do for you?
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything wrong!
Hm?
Looking for a fight?
I need help!

It's more than I can bear.
Can anyone help?
I owe you one.
Now what?
What do you want?

Pick up the pace!
Keep up, now.
What is it?
There's a familiar sight.
There's a familiar sight.
I need help!
Wait for my signal!
I've done nothing wrong!
Well, what do we have here?
Hello.
You're back! I didn't think I'd make it.
I feel awful.

Hello.
You arrived in the nick of time.
Ebonheart honor!

Safe travels, I hope.
Safe travels, I hope!
What?
Don't cross me.
Are you going to add to my problems?
I hope you're not bringing more trouble.
You return!
Some sujamma should set you right.
Lend a helping hand?
<Groan>
<Groan>
You return.
What hope is there?
Over here...please...
<Snore>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
Well, look at this...
You've got some nerve...
What's your pleasure?
You look thirsty.
Won't you take pity on me?
Won't you take pity on me?
<Groan>
<Groan>

<Groan>
Why must I suffer?
<Snore>
Looking to sell?

What can I do for you?
Could you...help me out?
I'm quite busy, can't you see.
I've got a lot to do here.
Back again?
Back again?
Help me...please!
Come! Drink up! Forget your troubles!
Hey! I started without you.
Hail.
<Groan>
Back again?
Back again?
I need help!
I'm still alive...for the moment.
No.
Hm?
What do you want?
Now what?
Why am I punished so?
Hail.
Hail.
Thank you.
Hm?
Yes.
Now what?
What do you want?
Now what?
Now what?
I can't...go on...
<Scream>
You again?
There's a familiar sight!

Work builds character, they say.

Yes?
I'll have what I'm having.
Yes?
I must find some help.

Onward!
There's a familiar sight!
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Hello.
You have my thanks.
What is it?
I tried to read that book. The covers were too far apart.
What is it?
You again?
I'm...going to need a minute...
<Scream>
You won't hurt me, will you?
Someone will pay for this.
<Groan>
I'm fading...
No one knows my pain.
No one knows my pain.
No one knows my pain.
Look who's here.
I never tell the truth to those unworthy of it.
Are you going to add to my problems?
Lend a helping hand?
Spilled it all over himself, the fool!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Won't somebody come?
What hope is there?
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
Xuth! What is that terrible smell?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Why must I suffer?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Now what?
Hm?
Anything you can give...
Ah, you again.
Hey! I didn't do it!
Hm?
Care to join me?
Greetings.
Greetings.
Argh, such agony...
I'm no better than before.
Ah, you again!
Now what?
I hardly remember what hope feels like.
Fate has been unkind.
Fate has been unkind.
Hm?
Ah, you again!
Ah, you again!
<Nightmare mumble>
Greetings.
May I help you?
Cause any trouble and you'll be sorry.
Well?
Keep your weapons sharp and close.
Well?
Kyne protect you.
You again?
You again?
Now here's a likely one.
Help me turn my luck?
Progress is slow, but steady.
Progress is slow, but steady.
Now!
I'm not the one!
Hello.
It's good to see you!
I hope you've got deep, loose pockets!
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I can't feel my legs.
Move!

You again?
You again?
We've got to keep moving.
<Scream>
<Scream>
Watch it...I am of a foul temper.
I don't need much...
I suppose I could use another break.
I suppose I could use another break.
Hello there.
You look like I could use a drink.
It's been awhile.
Oh, this is bad. Bad!
I...I can't move.
I...I can't move.
My grief is without end.
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Snore>
What?
It's been awhile.
You can't be too careful when you're picking your enemies.
What?
What?
What?
On top of it all...here *you* are.
This work isn't going to do itself.
Will no one come to my aid?
You can't keep me like this!
You look well!
You're back.
Will no one come to my aid?
<Groan>
<Groan>
What am I to do?
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Why, look who it is!
Coins burning a hole in your pouch?
Spare any coins?
Spare any coins?
There's no end in sight.
Filled the whole bucket, he did!
<Groan>
<Groan>
The world grows dark...
Take the goblet of blood, and drink deep.

I'm busy. Very busy.
I suppose I could use another break.
I'm busy. Very busy.
Greetings.
Hm?
Going to stay longer this time?
<Groan>
Argh, such agony...
I'm glad you're back. I grow weak.
Well?
Now what?
Ah, you again!
Hm?
I can hardly believe it...I'm free!
May I help you?
May I help you?
May I help you?
Yes.
Well?
Now what?
Who's got a whetstone?
Well?
Now what?
Now what?
I...I'm so afraid...
Yes?
How can anything hurt so badly?
What is it?
I can't feel my legs.
I've not improved...
I've not improved...
It's good to see you!
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
I don't need much...

Set me free!
Duty to the Tribunal. All day long.
Not a moment too soon!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Welcome!
What?
Did you hear something?
What?
What?
Did you hear something?
Wait, please...
Don't trifle with me.
You're back!
Come get your hands around a mug!
Why won't anybody believe me?
Will no one believe my story?
<Groan>
Why, look who it is.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Let's sharpen those skills, shall we?
Why, look who it is.
Did you meet the new commander?
Must you bother me?
The world grows dark...
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Why me?
<Groan>
I've got just what you need.
What?

Ah, you again!

Cause any trouble and you'll be sorry.
Now what?
Ah, you again.
Now what?
You again?
It's good to see you!
Divulge your needs to this one!
It's good to see you!
Help me turn my luck?
Progress is slow, but steady.
Progress is slow, but steady.
I thought no one would come.
I'm guilty of nothing!
What's this I see?
It's good to see you.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Help me out, won't you?
Help me out, won't you?
I need help!
You didn't forget me!
I'll be alright. I've had worse.
What is it?
You again?
You didn't forget me!
<Nightmare mumble>
It's good to see you.
Of course.
Aldmeri grandeur!
Ebonheart honor!
This one can help you, yes?
I don't need much...
You look like I could use a drink.
Still among the living, I see.
<Groan>
Still among the living, I see.
It's been awhile.
<Groan>
What?
This one can help you, yes?
<Nightmare mumble>
Nice to see you again!
You can't be too careful when you're picking your enemies.
What?
Ready to do some business?
Just a coin...or two.
Will no one help me?
You can't keep me like this!
<Groan>
What am I to do?
What am I to do?
My end grows near...
My end grows near...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Do not test me, unclawed fool!
What's this?
Spare any coins?
I've got just what you need.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Help!
Will no one come to my aid?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Ah, it's you!
Spare a copper or two?
I don't seem to be making much progress.
Ah, it's you.
Help me!
Come have a drink with me!
Are you following me?
Greetings.
I wasn't sure I'd live to see your return.
Help me...please!
Hm?

Fate hates me.

I must locate four of the Third Squad's missing soldiers.
I have seen the nightmares the Baron keeps in his cellar. The undead walk through his keep, welcome as if honored guests. Merin Brushe will wish to know of this monstrosity.
I've retrieved several Knight of the Flame tabards. Sir Graham will be eager to have these back.
Perhaps talking to Sir Hughes will allow me to awaken from his dream.
I defeated the Withered Hand in the vault, but it seems some of them escaped with the Ansei Wards. I should inform the king.
I should visit the grave of <<1>>.
I delivered the cure. I should speak to Miranda.
A panicked Wayrest guard told me Sergeant Stegine is in Dreughside, defending the citizens against attacking dreugh.
S'rashi asked me to help collect debts from people in Wayrest who owe him money. The first man, Louis Ervine, is in Wayrest's Market Square.
I should check with the Captain of the Guard inside the palace to return the stolen items and ask about the thugs I encountered in the city streets.
I destroyed the Omen of Blood. I must enter the portal in Hosni at-Tura's manse.
Count Hosni told me Abbot Durak is awaiting me at Pariah Abbey. I need to tell him the Dream Shard is safe.
A spirit appeared after I destroyed the skulls. I should speak to it.
Now that I have Sir Edain's blade, I must use it on each spectral opponent before I destroy it, so I can trap their spirits. I should bind the souls of Arie, Gilbert, and Emory of The Three.
I've cast the sword into the fissure and destroyed the souls of The Three. I must seek out Sir Edain's spirit.
I should return to <<1>> on the west side of the docks. Now that he's spoken with <<2>>, he should realize that <<3>> isn't in league with the slavers.

Leveque called for help. After I deal with this, I should talk to Leveque and see if he's ready to cooperate.
I need to disarm the traps to clear a path for the hostages. I should also create a diversion. Burning the Red Rooks' boat and archery platform should distract the bandits. Plus, the smoke will make it hard for the bandits to spot the nobles.
I defeated Tharkul and recovered Lady Noellaume's lockbox. I should return it to her once she's safely away from the Red Rook bandits.
<<1>> gave me an amulet that I can use to reveal hidden werewolves. If I point the amulet at Camlorn refugees and activate the spell, any werewolves hiding among them will be revealed.
Sibellec gave me a charm to use on the corpses of hags I slay in the bog. This will charge the charm with power for when I face the coven's leader, <<1>>.

Gabrielle's ritual was a success. I should meet her inside the crypts of Cath Bedraud.
The wanderer told me to use the Call, a goatherd's whistle with chimes, to attract a goat. I should lead the goat to a nearby plateau overlooking the oasis. Supposedly, a serpent will come and eat the goat.
After consulting a set of bones, Hadoon informed me that I am fated to die in the jaws of a terrible duneripper named Istraga. Istraga roams the desert south of Leki's Blade. Hadoon wants me to bring him one of its scales as proof.
I found another bone buried in the sand. The dog then ran off to what appears to be another mound of sand. I should follow the dog and unearth the next mound of sand.
The Commander has ordered me to go into  kill thirty members of the Ebonheart Pact or Daggerfall Covenant.
The Skirmisher has instructed me to kill a member of the Ebonheart Pact.
General Thoron has ordered me to  kill ten members of the Ebonheart Pact or Daggerfall Covenant.
I should join with other warriors to launch an attack. Capturing a single keep multiple times will not impress Grand Warlord Zimmeron.
<<1>> has given a grand speech thanking me for returning the Ansei Wards. I should speak to the king and see if anything remains to be done.
Four members of the Hinault family are unaccounted for: the mother, two sons, and a daughter. Heloise has asked me to find them and, if necessary, burn their dead bodies and collect their ashes.
I agreed to obtain the Covenant's orders from their camp to the north of Fort Arand.
I've slain a number of assassins within the walls of Fort Arand. Llaari asked me to speak with Strikes-from-Shadows about the next step for repelling the Covenant. Strikes-from-Shadows should be waiting at the tower on the eastern side of the fort.
<<1>> thought she saw <<2>> walking out of town before the volcano erupted. I should go west to the base of Ash Mountain to see if I can find her.
Now that the enslaved dead are free to move on, I should seek out the spirit of Ix-Utha.
I noticed a tome lying out in the circle's meeting place in a cave. I should grab it so Furon can understand what this cult is doing.
Captain Llaari thinks the Covenant assassins will be lurking near the walls of the fort. I should use the flasks of blinding light until I uncover the infiltrators. Then I must kill them.
When I found <<1>>, he asked me to slay the <<2>>. It's inside a cave at the bottom of a waterfall east of <<3>>.
I should report to <<1>>.
<<1>> might be able to provide me with more details on problems in <<2>>.
I must find Ruvali and see if the creature has copied her.
I found the totem. I must return to Ruvali. I also found her husband's corpse.
A simulacrum of Seeks-the-Night has appeared in front of me. I should speak to it and see what it has to say.
<<1>> wants to force the spirits into the great beyond. She's asked me to use the <<2>> on one of the spirits of the battlefield.
The person I helped should be waiting outside. I need to find her so she can tell me where the villagers are being held.
The General claims Ragna Stormcrag is a Nord spy. There's something strange going on here, but I'll find Ragna and see what she has to say.
I must travel to Fort Virak. I need to help Pact soldiers retake it.
As I was warned, all three shrines were troubled by ravenous alits. However, that had nothing to do with disapproval by the Tribunal. They were drawn by piles of offal left near each shrine. I should return to <<1>> with this news.
I learned the name of this Khajiit pirate leader: it's <<1>>. <<2>> told me one of her pirates would be meeting with a Dominion contact in the warehouse very soon. I should hurry there and find a suitable hiding place.
I defeated my opponent and completed the Trial of the Fang. I should speak to <<1>>.
I awakened Hissmir's Zaht stones. I should inform <<1>> that Hissmir doesn't need to fear Dominion reprisals.
To complete the Trial of the Mind, I must understand which elements of Argonian history match up. Three Argonian texts should provide clues.
<<1>> asked me to investigate <<2>>. He has a house in town. He'd like me to wait outside and follow Rhavil when he leaves. Drathus cast a spell that will allow him to see what I see and communicate instructions to me.
Rhavil has left his house. I should follow him, but I must be careful not to get too close.
Now that I've spoken to the people on <<1>>'s list, I should enter the mortuary so I can examine the bodies. <<2>> gave me a key to get inside. He said I can find the mortuary on the outskirts of Stormhold.
<<1>> fears the cultists plan to enslave the living skeletons of <<2>>. She told me <<3>> has a way to stop the cultists' plan, but it requires my help. I should speak with him.
Before I can recover the <<z:1>> holding the villager's spirits from the Worm Cult, I must bring an offering to a nearby temple of Clavicus Vile, the Daedric Prince who cursed them. <<2>> will give me the key to the ruin.
<<1>> traveled to the ruins northwest of Hissmir, possibly looking for the Hist amber needed to activate Hissmir's defenses. I should confront him there.
I need to speak to Commander Taldyn in the training yard to determine what to do about the Sentinels.
A scout of the Kagesh tribe met me as I passed Iliath Temple. He explained the situation and asked me to meet the wise woman of his tribe. She's at her encampment east of the temple.
I've finished forging a crown. I should take it to <<1>>.

Gui Somner says: We'll deal with her minions. Slay the witch!
Roche: Elsie, your time here is done.  Vacate under your own will - or my men will remove you by force.
Roche: Are you sure you wish to test your limited powers for this wench, Brennoc?
blows on the whistle causing the Hound Dog to look for nearby cattle.
Pierric: Guen! I have returned, for good.
King Sebastien should do something about the stench wafting up from the village. Some days it is quite unbearable.
Ahhh! Tiny mouse no hurt ogrim!
I couldn't agree more. I'll shatter your bones this time, Dathieu.
Hello, Raymonde.
What were you saying, Orsiln? I am having trouble focusing.
Good to see you.
The Fellwatch is a menace. Someone should do something about them.
I don't care what everyone is saying, I am doing what I can. What would you have me do? Steal?
07 - May the Divines go with you.
05 - Goodbye.
09 - You, too.
I won't allow Alcaire to fall into Redguard hands.
The Fighters Guild is dedicated to keeping the peace in Tamriel. Well, for a price. They're always looking for new members.
It's been a while since anyone but the Redguards have explored the deep desert where the Dwemer once lived. Do they know what's out there, under the sand?
I am ready for you, Lord Gette. I am yours to command. Do as you will.
Do you imagine you can just walk away after killing my pets? I think not.
I hope my son hasn't sent another fool to dig up my grave.
Ah, fresh prey.
Ah, that's the herb I need.
Kiss me, hero...
What are you doing?!  Stop!
What a terrible dream! Er... what am I doing out here?
They have broken through! Master Gemin, I am... sorry...
has entered the spring Dalen spoke of.
Greetings.
Very well.
I'm ready. I'm coming.
Abandon ship!
You haven't stopped me, mortal.
Raw meat, raw meat! Aieee!
No! I'd never kill my son. This must be a nightmare!
Alessia, grant me strength!
Attention!  A brave soul approaches the arena!
Brelayne, I know I don't deserve your respect, but give me this moment as an act of charity.
All right, let's go.
catches ablaze from the nearby fire, burning off the poison.
Lets see how <<1>> can handle the fierce arena lions!
By the Three! I've been looking for you for days.
Stop! Get away from there!
You House Dunmer worry too much. I have people clearing them out.
I'll run ahead to check on preparations. Follow me down when you're ready.
One clean blow. Strike swiftly now.
Get away from there!
Your head will make a fine trophy.
But never mind that! Come close my friend, and speak with an old man. The Planemeld continues, and I have much to tell you....
If you do not complete your appointed task, I will take the amulet from your corpse and place it there myself!
Lord, Mother, and Wizard! Comfort your faithful as their souls ascend from Mundus to Aetherius.
wriggles loose and flies away.
Into the barn you go, foul beast.
Thank you! Look for me when you return to Senie.
Elder Ula-Tei! The Dunmer are marching into the heart of the coral-child! The Dreugh are swarming!
What's all this grainy sand on my bread? Hmm. Doesn't taste too shabby.
You'll never take me alive!
A sad display of skill indeed! The Tribunal must be getting desperate.
Brought out of the bones only to be sent back again... without my revenge... a curse on you!
Morgiah, do my eyes deceive me? Thank the gods. You're not sick! You look well.
You've seen too much.
Hail, citizen. For Averos!
No! The ritual has been interrupted!
Wait! Please don't leave me out here alone!
That's a good trick. I'll have to remember that one!
Feed, my children. Fatten with blood.
What's that? No!
You've got your quarry, lizard. I expect to be paid in full.
This doesn't taste like it usual...
What? How did you... no matter! You will fall before the power of Fharel the Necromancer!
You... you will pay for that!
You waste your flesh. But I can redeem it.
Thank you... for this... release.
Oh, my poor deluded sister! Thank you for saving her, as confused as she is!
Please, you have to help us.
Did Edain send you with his little toy sword? I will rise again!
They say slavers are around.
If the Redguards attack, the knights will protect us. Right?
I bet Duchess Lakana enthralled the duke!
Who's next?
Fool! Your interference will not be tolerated!
Serve or suffer, cur. I've bound you to my will. Glenumbra's destruction is your only goal.
Now we may finally learn how Faolchu was defeated.
And maybe we'll find out how tall the horker really was.
What is this? I've never felt such pain!
The spirits of Westtry belong to me!
For House Deleyn!
For the knights of the king!
The armor has shattered!
Is it over?
The nightmare has ended. We're free.
Islaif the Highwayman, you dirty dog!
We care not for your past or your station, only the courage for which you are famed!
Warrgh!
I do.
No! No, don't! What ... who are you?
You're making a grave error.
I'll head back to the inn. Good luck fighting Faolchu!
We will meet again.
Taking up those blades may lead to something far worse than death!
We must stop Shiri.
I am so happy! Wait … something is wrong. I feel …. Ugh!
How are you doing that?
I'm never getting out of here.
Come, speak with me before you enter the Vault.
Where are you going? This isn't the right way!
TEST: Protector - Protection Taunt
You old goat! I ought to run your Thieves Guild out of town.
|cff0000MAX RANGE
The flag has been stripped and returned!
Damned Covenant! Will this bombardment ever stop?
You persist in annoying me. You are as irritating as a marsh fly.
You will not defeat me! Attack, slaves!
If you wish my aid, I'll be here.
Have you tasted the water lately?
Well, what have the Forebears been doing? Forming useless alliances?
I'm sorry to hear about your wife's passing. Have you had her consecrated yet?
And before the people started to grumble. I see what you mean.
Your interference grows tiresome, outsider!
Don't be foolish, Captain. Boredom is the only danger these soldiers face.
For Bjorick! For Hrogar! For Ysgramor!
Is this the place? Quarantine Serk?
Who's fallen? And where are my sons? Find them!
Not so close. He's getting suspicious.
Enough! I will drag you back to Oblivion with me!
You bear a gift? How thoughtful! But I can't accept it without providing one of my own.
Praise Vivec! Did Dolril send you?
Mercy! I yield!
Look what you've done! I've lost count!
You received Veloth's blessing and have come to the Hollow, just as I have foreseen.
Saying we shouldn't help the Dunmer. Hah! Like a Nord would ever turn down a fight.
Where are you going?
Indeed! My masterpiece will rival the Wailing Wheels of Vindasel!
Well done, my son.
The Viridian Woods thrive, thanks to you!
Namurrah's champion! Hallin's Stand toasts your victory!
There's no way I'm going back there!
It's a mistake to provoke House Dres.
You have wandered far. Rest now … with me.
Spirits of the bog! Creatures of nature!
The Daggerfall Covenant took my son!
Enough, Mother! Your faith in false gods blinds you to the truth.
They didn't stop to harass us for coin, so they're probably just mercenaries.
You've ruined our life together!
It's what she wants Ostarand. This is why we came here. Do it.
The Coral Heart can break his shield. Defend me.
Betrayer! Face me or my prisoner dies!
I hear your plea.
Two!
Five!
I give up!
Eight!
Hush, spirit. Aelif will ask the question.
Who killed you, Jofnir?
That … did not sound good.
It's gone. I'm free.
You have failed me, Doshia.
If they notice you, hide and put the disguise back on.
I yield! Take the invitation and leave me alone.
Did it work? Can I drink again?
That's not the way to the prison warden's office.
I don't know, but we'd better get back out there.
Use these harps to teach me the tune.
Door is locked, generous one.
No! Kazdi escapes!
My shield, lost … my blade, shattered! What bears a knight with missing means? Only despair ….
You're such a dog, Otroggar.
This way.
You should've seen it, Rolly. That cave is incredible.
Rana has no idea what she's doing.
Sever her connections to Molag Bal! Hurry!
Covenant mages are opening portals inside the fort!
Kyne's followers have no place here! This grove belongs to us now. We'll use these people as we see fit.
My son! You're alive! I thought I lost you.
She devoted her life to you. If you restore her, I'll return to the war. I'll take up my weapon to fight for your honor, and our people, once more.
I just know the netch will help turn the tide of battle.
Hmm. I thought I'd try Uveran's Cornerclub.
That Vixen is a nice looking Dunmer, don't you think?
Sure, but be careful what you say, she's deadly!
We appreciate your custom.
What's happening? Everything fades away!
Again!
What are you doing? No! Don't let him take me!
Would I get fed?
Not much. They keep to themselves. I think they worship Daedra.
Here? To this wasteland of ash and fungus? Did he hate them?
Come forward and witness my creation!
Son of a troll! If you want something done right, you just have to do it yourself.
I said I'd help you, right? My friend'll watch your back.
You dare violate the ancient grounds!
Of course they're similar. They're the same deity!
We will hold a massacre in Mauloch's honor!
You bring ruin to the valley and my people!
We have what we came for. The dirt's all yours, friend!
Father! I was so worried.
You've done it! Ysgramor!
This one wishes Beralagr's paw had not been broken. The bear, she can not dance well now.
Too little, too late, you fool. Neither you nor your supposed Skald-King can stop us.
This is true. We eat better now than when she danced.
It's Fildgor. I know why our brother stole my body and the crown. He plans to call forth my spirit and merge it with his own. He believes that by possessing me, he shall become the rightful king.
Please, friend, leave us so that we can talk. I'll join you in the waking world shortly.
<The giant growls angrily and turns back toward Cradlecrush.>
Let our enemies tremble at our combined might! I accept the role of High King of the Ebonheart Pact. We have much to discuss here. Please, Champion, return to Jorunn's Stand and tell my son what has transpired here.
Yes sir!
Let Rigurt be the first to welcome … one moment please. Let me just check my notes … Ambassador Flies-of-Steel and Ambassador Normal! Ha!
I can't leave the Crypts until I find my husband!
We must get into the Vault. I hope I'm wrong about why the Reachmen are here.
Well done. Too little, too late, though. The false king is dead. Once you join him, Fildgor will rule this land.
What about my daughter? The Worm Cult has promised to bring her back and you're in the way!
You've grown into a beauty, my child.
Anyone in here who can fight, get yourself outside.
Wait, that's not how it goes! It's "probable," not "laudable."
Good thinking, outsider. You'll fit in here, yet.
Undead of the deep! Heed my call! Destroy!
I know. But I must retake Fallowstone. I fear the worst. Let's go. We can talk on the way.
A book! We've made a book! Now the bard can sing the story!
Come on! Open!
Who are you to disturb our roots?
Foolish girl! I serve the Veiled Queen! She is our true leader!
Help me!
I'm staying here till Silsailen is safe again.
Oh no! Here they come again!
Only one, the dread half-giant Sinmur, leader of Skyrim's giant clans, dared to face Wuuthrad and Ysgramor.
I do.
Allene! No!
No …. This can't be! I will not fail!
Ah, good. Now let's see if I can banish the Daedric influence from this creature.
Her graceful shape I heave up high\nAnd in one hand I hold her nigh\nHer waiting lips are never dry\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss
At least they're gone now, thanks to the Fists and our new militia!
I won another stupid contest today.
You did it! Now, I must perform the ritual.
Thank you for your help but, sadly, you're no longer useful to me. Prepare for death!
My attendants! How you will suffer!
Now, out of here! Save the Queen.
Queen Ayrenn, I fear for your safety. Please disregard what was said just—
We need to report back to the Queen. Let's get out of here.
Is anyone still alive out there?
Apologies. I didn't expect Lodorr to be so active.
Please, do something!
The elves who'd held Skyrim for time immemorial fell like grass before our blades! The Companions of Lord Ysgramor soon ruled all the land.
Test Artie SAT 2
How dare you harm my flock!
Not another word! Go!
Let him go.
I'm fine. You have a soul of steel, my love.
Just so you know, Zaban is never idle. Good day.
We made it. Get in there and find General Mandin. I'll signal the others to move in.
Test Artie SAT 9
More Direnni? Put an end to these pests. Now!
I was starting to hope you weren't coming in. Look at all this treasure!
Intruders! Quickly. Awaken Mistress Bandu!
Ha ha ha. Most entertaining.
I am going to return to the Sergeant. My orders don't allow me to tarry.
Awaken, my darling! I need you to wake and smash this rabble to pieces!
He wasn't the only one, ma'am.
The registrar still won't see us. And our guar steaks are beginning to spoil in their carts.
You won't! I'll never come back, I swear!
Good riddance. I never want to see this spot again.
You! Deliver a message to <<1>>. The Mages Guild has everything we need for the ritual.
Aren't you done fixing that yet?
Don't be so dramatic. You've bread and shelter here, which is more than you had in High Rock.
The time is now. Seek me by the cliffs outside Davon's Watch. Hurry.
The growth of hatred chokes the faithful. Burn away this taint.
I was just following orders!
Deputy seemed pretty edgy. I think something is going to happen soon.
After I kill you, I'll make you my slave!
I don't know about that, but the Reachmen sure want something in that mine.
What about old Wandering Eye?
No! You're not serious. Is he dead?
No! What happened?
Keep your voice down, Belera. The Hands of Almalexia don't tolerate blasphemy.
No idea. It's just a rumor. Like the one about Reachmen with trained bears up in the mountains.
I say, did you see that Khajiit scum near the temple grounds? Disgusting, letting a mongrel near the house of Auri-El.
Who dares disturb the rest of <<1>>?
Awaken, thralls! Destroy these tomb robbers!
What was that voice?
The Keep has been abandoned for ages, sealed by unyielding frost—the locals say that it is haunted. Despite this, I hope to reclaim my ancestral home.\n\nShould ill-fortune befall me, I have left these Speaking Stones behind to tell my tale.
It looks clear now! Hurry. Meet me back at the manse!
Agh. Aaaaaaaagh!
I can't wait to see my family.
All right, that's enough. Break it up you two!
Puppy doesn't like you, does he?
Again!
Just the two of us. Now we can talk in peace.
You're the only one that thinks you're funny, Mad God!
Apparently, not everything is under your control!
Not yet, anyway.
There they are! Get 'em!
Wait, you're not my … what have you … did you poison me?
You first.
Word of advice. Don't let them capture you. If you can't get away, die fighting.
The cultists have somehow sealed the doors with the welkynd stones.
Enough of this nonsense! I'll deal with you myself!
Don't be ridiculous! Your man forfeited the match. I owe you nothing!
I am the Blessed Crucible! You are nothing!
Just remember. Laugh a little bit every day. It'll do you good.
That red barrier is blocking the door. We'll need to turn it off somehow in order to get through.
Do you know what I've been through? Where've you been?
All I did was provoke a showdown that was coming anyway.
Tell me, are those Redguards here to cause trouble? I'm so worried. My father lives outside the walls.
What have you done? The pressure has grown too great! Now we have to start over.
We've done it, dearie! Follow me, it's time you were introduced to the Dance!
The first Mane? Incredible!
The Mages Guild cannot turn on the Dominion so easily. You are a part of this world, like it or not.
Either you're with the Dominion or you're against us. You want to be removed from this world? Fine. I'll do it for you.
Abnur Tharn, you traitorous bastard! I should have expected to find you here!
Come on. It's time to go.
If you'll allow me ….
Hot guts! That's what I'm talking about!
This whole time, it was like watching myself from a distance. I felt … disconnected.
But now, this is the best I've felt in years. Like I've been reborn! And I owe it all to you. Thank you.
Just need to attune this spell matrix ….
Nothing. Those dogs hit us and ran off.
Hope you're not keeping score!
How could I not? But … the spinners have summoned me. I must go to Silvenar.
Damn straight I did! The Covenant needs swords, so I enlisted.
We worship you.
Why?
Ha! That'd end the waiting 'cause we'd be dead!
Strange that such a small thing can cause such terror. It must be destroyed!
You don't know nothing.
Only one of these will unbar the way. Choose carefully.
You found something, didn't you? What is it?
Yeah, I stashed them in the footlockers all around camp. I bet the commander makes her run fifty laps this time!
Send for me if you need me, sire.
Get into that uniform and act natural. Should fool some of them at least.
Get word to the Captain, we need a dozen men ready for travel north. Firsthold is under attack!
As you say, sir. I'll get to the Captain at once.
I won't allow Alcaire to fall into Redguard hands.
Horrible! What happened?
Dead's not quite right. It's like it's born backwards. When it dies, it turns into an egg. Or so they say.
Only the swamps know, and they're not telling.
I must return the relics to their rightful places, and quickly!
I would give it all, Mira. The sword, the keep, the kingdom … all of it for you ….
Watch over Indal. Keep him safe in the fighting to come.
Don't worry, we'll be ready for them next time.
You cannot stop the inevitable. The city is ours. Soon I will hold your "Mane" in my hand, and my Dark Mane will walk the Path. The soul of the Khajiit will be lost to darkness!
It's that fool Remius again. Madria, go inside. Now.
Let's keep after it! They can be quick!
One more to go.
Let's take the skulls to the stone table to interrogate them.
Dark Moons! This one is even stronger than the one outside.
I'm sorry, but this is the only way.
Hey, you ready to get off of here?
Who's out there? If you're one of the Stormfists, you'll regret it if you come in here!
This tastes … different than usual.
Ah. That's much better. I'd say it feels like I regained the use of a limb. If I had any.
Happy adventuring.
Now … I reclaim what was taken from me. Eyevea! Hear my call!
Give us the cat, snake, and we'll end your life quickly.
Yes, let's talk about that sword. It's bigger than you are!
These poor creatures. Just … slaughtered. Nothing ever changes.
Help me … destroy … the crystal ….
Merric at-Aswala. Present yourself to the council.
Indaenir, stop trying to save everyone! You cleared the tunnel and that is enough. Akkhuz-ri will return to Marbruk and send reinforcements here.
Farewell, <<1>>.
We must hurry. So many Ash'abah have already died.
I can't fight him for long! Quickly, place the <<1>> in the pedestals!
Look what they've done to our home! Rip them apart!
More constructs!
Finally! <<1>> will find this fabled brush.
You've had enough, Verene. Time for you to go.
A moment, my mortal trifle. Come close. I have one last secret to whisper in your ear.
You're too late. The dark anchor shall be created!
That was for Saronor, bitch! Ahem. Search the house. I'll get rid of … this.
By chance, or by destiny, I found him while braving the frigid wastes of Skyrim!
Now an intruder has breached the temple. Destroy them. Do not fail me!
Darkness awaits you!
This one knew the vessel was weak.
Gah—ah!
We're out of time! The Daedra have broken out of Ilmyris!
Our defending champion needs no introduction!
The Mistress of Malice! The Princess of Pain!
Ravius falls to the Mysterious Stranger!
The king thinks it's important, I suppose … keeping up appearances for the rest of the Covenant.
My son … you failed me. Now, you will die!
But my husband, we have just arrived! I cannot bear another journey across the sands so near to the birth.
You think you can steal from the Crosstree Bandits?
One must arrive early to see the truth of things.
I said "if," Clan Mother.
It's all coming back to me! There's a lever across the chamber. Just give it a good tug and that flywheel will be spinning in no time.
I heard nothing…
I smell death in here, Sameer. Gods, look at the walking bones! Do these Elves have no shame?
Mara bless you! I thought for sure I was going to be burned alive!
Go to your room, Abnur. I will deal with you shortly.
This is your last chance to turn tail and run before I destroy you.
Are the bailiffs covering that up? This is the first I've heard of it.
Hey! Are you down there? I need to speak to you!
Mane Akkhuz-ri, it is a pleasure to meet you. The Khajiit and their faith will be the Dominion's bulwark against the darkness.
What's going on here?
Why are your clothes all wet?
Mother! What do you think of this tree? How about this island you're standing on?
You killed my mother, you bastard!
You notice how one merchant almost soil himself?
<<1>> did good job infiltrating and taking control. We make whole camp refuge for bandits soon.
You won't be sorry if we ever get into an actual battle.
The Dremora are keeping the seal intact! You'll have to kill them too!
Why are we bothering with this girl and her clods of dirt? Andur could melt them with hardly a thought.
You want us to hide behind these walls? To leave our comrades to die while you sip wine and lounge about? You have no honor, knight!
We shall work this out. I understand your reservations. But with my leadership, the Fighters Guild will help us win this war.
This one does not like it, but perhaps you are right. Still, keep checking, will you?
I have absolute confidence in Vanus and his mages.
This one stands before you, humbled. Your Mane no longer.
The next Mane, whoever they are, must have your trust and loyalty.
Your sorrow is misplaced. Your sister is at peace. Together, you and she have walked the Two Moons Path to its end.
We shall see.
Enter the portals! Board their ship!
I'll be fine. I have the marsh in my veins.
You have a better idea? Spit it out.
Shazah, please try to be brave. I'm sorry I won't be there for you and your sister, and I pray that the Flu never reaches Dune. Look after our family, and remember always. Your father loves you. Moons above, he loves you.
Greenhill has been lost to us.
Spare your apologies, Cro—I mean neighbor. I splintered your fence with a rake. By Zeht, I think we are even.
Look. Another one.
We were finishing up when they appeared. They were after the crystal and tome. How did they know? How did they know about this place?
Darien the Brave joins you on your first assault. Allow his courage to be your beacon in the darkness.
That's nice, dear.
Y'ffre's bones! The corruption is coming from the den of the Eldest! We need to get there—quickly!
Peace, my love. It will all be over soon.
Free at last!
Who were you talking to a moment ago?
Wait, why are you in my tent? Who are you?
What sort of training, Father?
Be gone, foul creature! We don't have time for your games.
Let's get moving. We can do this.
Indaenir?
Elolir, go check on those defenders. They took a big hit with the last wave and I want them to be ready for whatever comes next.
I command here! Die!
This … can't be!
You have been a most useful weapon, little mortal. Take the Labyrinth key, with my thanks.
Pah, you are both overreacting. What do you care for front-line soldiers? You both received your shipments.
Tu'whacca demands justice be done!
Hopefully, that's the last of the veil. Let's see if we can get through that door now.
We have a new contender!
Damn you, Lyranth! I see your hand in this. I'll make sure you join your clan in the darkness.
The door's finally open! Let's go!
<<1>> is tainted by evil. He will never again be fit to lead our people.
That's a sucker bet! The Hidden Armigers have hit us at least once a week for the past three months.
And now stamina returns. How I've missed you, old friend!
Is it true? Did Hilka really sell us out?
I need you to contact the other spy networks, the Eyes of the Queen of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Ring of Daggers in the Daggerfall Covenant.
Fjar was the traitor? Family-man Fjar? I could kill that Daedra-spawn. Thragof, give me a month and dispensation, and I'll have his entire family in Pact hands.
Grashla! Thushbeg! No! This cannot be!
I know, but this is important. Thanks, Naryu.
I'll scout on ahead. We need to know what we're going to face at that gatehouse.
That's the beast that webbed me! Take care, friend.
You have done well to make it this far, but there is still more to do to set me free.
Thank you. I thought I was done for!
Keep watch while I close this.
All right then.
By the Divines! What are civilians doing down here?
Time has changed our coin's worth. I couldn't buy much with our savings.
Are you proud of being members of the Fighters Guild? Your lot is little more than sellswords.\n\nWe'll make you powerful as followers of Mephala. Be grateful.
Halt, thief!
Come on! We're almost there!
<<1>>! Who put you back together? Are you to blame for these Worm Cultists?
Queenseye! You are needed at once!
No! Leave me alone. By the King's shaft, I'll scream!
He's dead, you bastard! Yahyif is dead!
You just heard that? Didn't you know that's why we're here?
My part in the story began when I awoke on the steps of the Abbey of the Moth Priests, with no memory of my prior life.
Everything must follow the appropriate process, or a judgment can't be reached. We must begin again.
I've read about such things, but the books don't do it justice.
Molag Bal's Dark Anchors pierce the torn veil, and seek to draw Nirn into the depths of Coldharbour. These terrible engines of destruction have been appearing all throughout Tamriel.
I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day.
Stay down, Keeper, you're injured.\n\nIf the others yet live, we should find them—then deal with Rilis, if we can. He has already escaped. I will not suffer further dishonor by losing lives to him.
Hold! This has gone on long enough!
Ha ha ha! What are you lot doing? Oh, I do so love to see magic. Is that what this is? This isn't as grand as the spells I learn from the Daedra, but I don't expect much from mortal Altmer.
But to give them shelter would have put our whole city at risk.
So much destruction! What could have done this?
I'm afraid I've seen this before. Keep an eye skyward, Titanborn!
Do you mean the spy we caught skulking around our wrecked ships? He stays put.
So you've been mingling with the enemy, have you, Dariah? Just so you know—I already knew that.
Newest of the Briars, you have my blessing. Good luck, and return to my forest any time.
Freeze you ….
We rise to fight beside you!
Enemies at the inner gate! Come quickly, we'll drive out the Worm Cult!
It's just you and me now.
This one has no regrets.
It's done. Too late, but it's done.
Give my best to Thrush. Tell him I hope we can dance again, soon.
5
You killed Sees-All-Colors.
Dynar, the last Ayleid King. I saw him ordering around the Fighters Guild.
Don't be alarmed. Soon the pain will subside.
We will soon have this back in hand. Keep faith, my friends.
Filthy Ra Gada! I'll pick my teeth with your bones!
Can you feel it? That energy in the air! The spell is working!
He's gone. Come on, let's get out of here.
… thank you ….
He promised me power, the respect I deserve … but then he cursed my tongue with madness and let me make a mess of this town!
What?
You did it! The bridge is down!
Aulie, I left you a tongue that drives people mad! But I suppose if you don't want my gift, I can take it from your mouth and give it to my new favorite mortal friend.
We can't go through the town. Not after what's happened.
One last quest, old chap! One last leap into the fire! Unless we survive, of course. But how likely is that?
Mara's bosom, Bugbekh! What do you plan on burying out here? A mammoth?
It was for King Eamond—but then I hear that they carted his body south to Bangkorai Garrison.
What's happening? I hear the Thalmor has issued a call to arms.
Seaside Sanctuary. Rumor has it the Veiled Heritance is involved, too. Those traitors just won't give up.
Chim-el Adabal. The Amulet of the Kings of Glory. An artifact of the Divines, a badge of office for the ruling emperors of Cyrodiil, and the key to my ascendancy. Yet it eludes me.
It wasn't him. They've uncovered papers belonging to Pelidil and Kinlady Estre showing that they conspired with the Veiled Heritance to raise Naemon from the dead and use him as a figurehead.
Ambush! Defend the queen at all cost.
Fried fire salts! They're coming all right. Don't forget, we're looking to you to direct our spells. Don't worry about targeting over our allies. I promise, we won't fry the queen. Everyone—call them out when you see them!
Sad, isn't it? The poor child.
I know, Sai. It's over. It's all over.
Stenwick, who's this? A wyress?
Things feel different. Molag Bal's hold on my mind has been lifted. I am finally free of him!
Now, we have only to consecrate the second shrine before we can enter the vault.
Thank you! Thank you … I thought I would never be free.
I should never have created this thing in the first place.
You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?
I should be able to close the portal. It won't take me more than a few seconds.
Your targets are Captain Siro and the Worm Cultist. Make the first move, and I'll surprise them from behind. Good hunting.
Wylon, my love, I'm afraid.
You hear that, <<1>>? It's the last of your rebellion, collapsing upon itself.
We have a better chance of finding them if we split up and search different areas. I'll meet you later.
Almalexia sees great things from you, but whether good or bad, I can't say. Thank you for your help.
You would deny our moment of glory, Count? The Light shines on us this day!
I'm free ….
I've never heard a High Elf talk like you do.
I hate being caged. Makes me all … itchy. Anyway, Orlozag shoved a letter in that chest over there. It explains a lot.
I love this part.
Do you have any idea how many coins I lost in that wager? Pah. Damned show stopper.
Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!
Look out! They're coming from the stables!
Blasphemy! How dare you raise the honored dead to fight your battle!
Well done! Let's get back to Elden Tree!
You there. We need to talk.
That was <<1>>, scion of evil King Anumaril. He must have been left behind to defend the Vivicus.
I will have you, Vestige! Pathetic prophecies and trinkets of holy powers are fleeting! I am immortal! I am undying! Your world will drown in blood!
<<1>>, stop your relentless pacing! It's giving me a headache.
Halls of the gods or halls of the dead? Which is it? Is there a difference?
Molag Bal, Father of Torment, we curse you! You sought to poison us with your blood.
To the new meat's mother. May she have many healthy children—since this one's a goner!
Children, this is your kin. Life still flows within its blood.
One favor I ask: if you see Commander Attius, kill him.
Here we go!
A trophy catch. I'll enjoy gutting you!
No, I'm saying you can't really know how we feel. Your home was never invaded.
I must not delay.
To arms! Defend the King!
It was your Queen's duty to protect us, High Elf! All of us. It doesn't mean your people can lord over the Bosmer.
Shut your mouth, Faindor! You're a horrible youth!
Hazzi! I am where the birds roost! Come!
Lead away, my friend!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Well, what do you think? Yes, you there. What are your thoughts on this?
This isn't going to be remotely fun.
Oh no! Master, please! Spare me!
Let's see how fast it can run!
That is not the blade a true sword-singer would wield. Try again.
We had words. He's threatened me.
Do you feel that?
By the Empyrean Light—I didn't know Nerien'eth had tortured so many of us. That whoreson dog!
As our visitor so eloquently pointed out, we cannot. But if we are to locate Sai Sahan, we must do this. Go with the Vestige, Lyris. Rescue Tharn. Give him the chance to redeem himself. He may surprise you.
Why am I not surprised to find Cadwell here? He certainly does get around.
This might be what we're looking for! Come to me!
Get this fool, my darlings!
Such is what the God of Schemes planned … a slow death brought to the heart of Y'ffre's power.
You mean your  ward of Stendarr, God of Merciful Forbearance, patron of gutless, law-abiding dimwits? It won't even slow me down!
How do you know? Were you there? I heard she had nothing to do with it.
Did you know there's a ruin, beneath these very roots? It's called an "Orrery."
Come forward, Vestige. You are safe, for now. Something precious to you has been riven from Stone-Fire's being. I have brought it here for you to reclaim.
No, release me!
You are just in time. Baron Montclair has departed, but Reezal-Jul is here. I am anxious to put an end to that foul Argonian.
Hear, hear!
And the living Undaunted returns! Still living!
Ho, ho, the captain's dead! Captain Blackheart's dead! And here comes the one who done the deed ….
So we've ruled it out. I wasn't robbed by a ghost. Sounds like an inside job, to me.
Spare no expense for his funeral. All in the Dominion are welcome. All may pay their respects to a hero.
<<1>>? We had assurances. How can we make him our puppet if we can't control him?
I do not disagree, Baron, but we need to proceed with caution. There is more to this situation than meets the eye.
I thought I was going to be dinner! Thanks! I'll see you back at the village.
How uncharacteristically optimistic of you, Titanborn. I may have that embroidered on a pillow.
Someone pass a sword through my face.
The poor girl. May these flames purify her spirit.
Her body was … mangled, rent apart by a terrible darkness. Its corruption is still on her. I can feel it.
What? No!
Gwendis, my child, slow down. You eat too fast. You don't want to harm poor Kallin.
That is not our way, child, and you know it. Stop feasting. Now!
Initiate. Kneel in the black pool and submit yourself to me.
Yes, Constable Gavendien. I'll close up right away. Just don't do anything … rash.
Destroy these echos of Yokuda, defenders of Craglorn! Protect me!
Wylon, please. We can find a way to free you from this power.
Hold on just a while longer, Gwendis. We're going to get you out of there.
The barrier has fallen! The portal chamber should be just a short way ahead.
Yes. That. I'd forgotten about that. Let's continue.
Arlie!
At last, the amulet contains the aetherial energy of all three of the Warrior's charges.
Oh, please aid them.
I'm going to be fine, father. Thanks to this traveler. Can we get me off of this rock now?
By the Three, this place chills me to the bones. Let's see if we can find my brother and then get out of here.
Thank the Tribunal you're back. I tried to go deeper into the crypts, but couldn't without you.
Don't do this, Dethisam. The Serk needs you. I need you.
Very well, but my directives will make this difficult.
You heard the lady. Let's go wait outside.
Test your knowledge of the art of the blade against me, if you would continue to the trial below.
There are two more seals to recover, two more tombs of the royal guard. The vanity of Tarish-Zi will serve us well. He had scribes record every conquest, every monument. They will have written about the burial places of all his retainers.
Belkarth is as good a place as any to take respite after our victory. I'm sure you have more questions for me. Find me there if you wish to speak. And well fought!
Ah, that'll be sore tomorrow. Let's get away from here before we're seen. I'll try to grab some proper clothes and a weapon. Meet me at the cave known as Buried Sands. There's something I have to retrieve there. I'll explain more when you arrive.
The Skystone Amulet was designed to capture the aetherial energy of the Mundus stones. You will need that energy for the task ahead. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I've already stayed too long.
All I ask … just … make them pay for this …!
Please, speak to him at once.
Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Elden Root, waiting for you!
Just need a moment to prepare … Adept, I don't blame you for choosing as you did. I made the same choice, years ago. I just hope … I thought you were better than that. Now, I hope you remember the look on her face. For all your years.
Rahni'za will no longer stand for this corruption. The school will protect those true to its cause!
Face me, <<1>>! Friends—activate the shards of Wuuthrad while I occupy the beast!
Hold the line against the Covenant while I complete the ritual.
This one's furry tail caught dinner, or have you forgotten? It is you who wanted to cook the meat!
This is Ealcil, speaking directly to your mind. Find my Psijic projection near the tunnel exit. I know how to stop the Maormer!
Better a quick death to Yokudan steel than a lifetime as slaves to those creatures. We should call on the stars for protection—as our ancestors did—and have nothing to do with these nereids and their sorcery!
Who sent you? It was Nhalan wasn't it? After all these years, he is still a traitor!
It looks like it worked. Maybe we'll actually find something now.
Be careful where you step, mortal. These nereids are my shield maidens. They empower those I protect. They could empower you, if only you would give yourself to me.
This is foolish. Good thieves don't pick their own nicknames.
I can't help it! I have a condition … it's alchemical or something, I swear. I'm cursed.
I said, "You are right." I have words for the snake. Where is he?
Quickly, before more arrive!
Fascinating! She knew this place was protected by aetherial power! A trap set by a Thief for a … a thief.
Hara… You? All along?
This sword will fell all the trees in the land—the snake's head is bound to roll from among them!
I came to this Archive to contain the damage I could cause. My loss of control blasted all that you see into terrible existence. Why do you persist? Turn back!
Enough!
The aetherial stone is active! We can use it against our foe!
Fight on! We need to keep recharging the stones!
Walk with me, my new friend. Come and taste the sweet fruit that is Cybiades.
Ho there, watchwoman! This is the emissary of our King Faharajad. It's a pleasure just to feel the reflected light of His Majesty, is it not?
Fool! You will never escape my realm.
Well, that was unfortunate. Let's try this again … and do remember that people are watching.
You did it! He's … gone.
Do you like the lute? I play. A little. Cassi says I'm good, but I think she's just being nice.
And when I say sacrifice, I mean that in the literal sense. It's amazing what powers one can acquire when you give yourself to a Daedric Prince.
I forget how quaint you are, Warrior. I have a fiery gift for the snake. Where is he?
He remains out in the world, wreaking havoc in this region.
Agreed. Let us convene at the Stone.
Defeated—locked away in his Apex Stone, but his attention will turn elsewhere. We should depart.
Surprisingly efficient. For a Thief and a Mage. Fall in line behind me. I will take charge from here.
There's no way this group will get past your defenders, master. But please, let them try. I love a good slaughter!
I've been waiting for this moment. You think you're good? You'll never be as good as me. Come now. Don't hold back! It's no fun if you don't try.
You're here! Let's go. We have to destroy the Sigil Stone in order to close the Oblivion Gate for good. Gilraen says the <<1>> guards it.
We were involved in the death of a Valkyn. This ordeal may not be over, Fin.
That settles it! On your feet, Brittgerd. It is time to fight!
Ha! A literal statement!
It has the Lord's favor. Do you see what it wears on its belt? If it truly wants to impress us, it should not cheat.
What do you think? It's been months! Are you all right?
Zantan is too old for this.
Your anger is uncalled for, clan chiefs. Please excuse us, Solgra. I see our champion has returned.
Too late, fool. The Arena will run slick with blood!
The Empress should have been the first to set foot in the Palace.
Fifteen? Amateur.
Look! Ancient artwork, just like in the antechamber! How exciting!
Most interesting. Might make for a good little story. Ever forward, my fellow adventurer!
Hmm. I wonder what happens if I press it?
Look at this place! Amazing! Simply amazing!
Look, our friends have returned to their senses. I told you they weren't dead, Stibbons.
And look! That must be the Armlet of Torug! I refuse to let you go through with your plan, Lady Laurent.
Did you find my dearest Sovelle? Please tell me she's all right!
Compared to some of my adventures, this was practically a day at the fair!
Disappear!
By the First Forge, I'll never get the hang of this!
Thank you, Solgra. I will speak to the outsider now.
Another note. Maybe it's another riddle?
Come on, the well is this way!
Damn gates! I forgot about them. Blasted engineers always making upgrades ….
Once I turn this lever, there's no stopping, so get ready.
All right, that's done. Let's keep moving.
No. What have you done?
Orc stonework never presents enemies in equal standing.
At which point <<1>> will be proven wrong.
We've got Daedra assaulting the northern door. Get over there and take them down!
Calm down. my brothers and sisters. We're in no condition to chase after anyone.
How many more must die before you speak?
We've got legion traitors approaching from the west. Cut them down!
Heads up! More of Bal's lackeys on the way!
Breathe. Just need to breathe. Fight it, man, fight it!
That was … unexpected. Never had a lid get stuck like that while I was … ah … investigating.
I did see a picture of a torch with a single candle below it when I came in here. I bet that's right!
Damn furniture tore up my sword arm. I'm practically useless!
Hold your position! Let no Winterborn get past you!
Our soldiers know what to do, Kurog. You can count on that.
I hope I'm making the right decision.
This hammer shows our ancestors' strength. With it, we forge a new destiny!
Don't touch anything! I beg of you, talk to us first!
This bath is ours for as long as we want! I paid in advance!
<<1>>, hearth-wife to the king.
No, I have business in Orsinium … yet I expect you to join me there shortly. I want you to cook the feast that will honor my husband. Can you do this for the king of the Orcs?
<<1>>. You're late.
I can do this … I can do this!
I demand a blood price for my mother's death, outsider!
Religion breeds fanatics. It's inevitable.
Hey! You're not allowed up here! Don't let them pass!
What's wrong, priestess?
Trinimac provides the challenge, but it's up to us to meet it.
Stand back, I haven't done this in quite some time. I'd hate to turn you inside-out.
Isn't the moot over? Can't we have a room now?
Lucky, I guess. But we have a new king.
A new king? That's mighty brave of someone. And who is our new king?
Did <<1>> say "brain pocket?" Is that what she's cooking?
Well, I'll be a puny Dark Elf! You found it! I guess we're climbing down that hole.
And now the last guest has arrived. I'm going to make you pay for your disloyalty.
Clan chiefs, over here! Arrgh! Hurry, this gate is … heavier than it looks.
Are you sure this is safe to eat? I'm not sure I even know what this is.
Oh, don't worry about it, I'm sure it'll be fine.
That poor thing! I yanked its tail right off!
I didn't like the way we left things, Josseline. And when I realized what the Grand Chanter was up to ….
Keeba is not for the likes of you! He's destined for the Commodore!
I'm tired of your complaining. Pay what you owe or the Red Sails will seize this ship.
It's a bit more communal than my academy. Which sounds far less obnoxious when you're from the Summerset Isles.
Surprise, you fools. I'll collect <<1>>—meet us back at <<Ac:2>>.
Tava's tail feathers, it's awful! What … what is that … that taste ….
I'm retired. I don't need to care for anything but my garden.
He's persistent and bad at taking hints.
She thought ….
<<1>> and I don't fight. We … disagree. Fundamentally. On many, many things.
It was very much the same … only the guild was much larger, we had a different guildmaster, and the Iron Wheel wasn't after any one of us.
Two. Two sprigs of thistle!
There are so many beggars and poor here. Don't the merchant lords see the city falling into squalor?
Oh, this should be good. And why is that?
He did the same thing to me. What do you suppose it meant?
Hard to miss you in that.
Shh! Did you hear something?
The palace is crawling with Iron Wheel. Lead the way—we'll follow from the shadows.
And this must be Danobia's crown. <<1>>, you've doomed yourself.
Empty. Search the room. Look for anything that stands out.
Let the hunt begin!
We all have a vice, don't we? Is it greed? Lust ? Mmm … it's lust, isn't it? I can always tell.
<<1>> is no mutt! She simply has a nose for the finest meats. And this time I'm keeping her far away from the food. She will be on her best behavior!
<<1>>!
Anais, I didn't …. You weren't supposed to be here.
What foolishness is <<1>> planning?
SAT music
And I thought you were dead. Seems we were both disappointed.
And … who are you? I don't believe we've met.
Guards! Guards!
Narahni, are you all right? I specifically stated that you were not to be disturbed!
Gladly, but I can't keep it open for long. The innkeeper doesn't like me using magicka in here.
My plan is to get the Iron Wheel's boot off our necks!
You see, <<1>>? Your protege returns, having survived the "invulnerable" Iron Wheel. You should have more faith.
What was that noise? What's going on in here?
That winch is a problem. One moment ….
We'll talk later.
Is that … my mother?
Take any harbor town, with the normal fish stenches. Add swampland, the hot sun, and filthy pirates.
I remind you of someone who owned a pet?
Jone will rot.
Untie me and we can forget all about this, Walks. For old time's sake. Are you listening to me?
My point exactly. We know almost nothing about him.
No. But she carries the loss with her. And she will, until the day she dies.
Have you thanked <<1>> for her part in that?
Disagreements rarely have such volume.
Are you trying to sell me a warehouse?
She could have said it like you did.
You wouldn't! But—oh, haha, you're pulling my tail … or are you? I can't tell!
That's disgusting!
Hand it over. Ought to buy you a few days. Don't start slacking off.
Right. Of course. I … I just need a moment to confer with my associate.
Enough! This ends now!
This temple—this world is ours!
Now's our chance. Follow me!
I said the food is not ready! Now go, before I beat you with a spoon!
It seems I'll need to use something harsher than words to deal with you.
Quickly now, search the courtyard and kitchens. Then meet me in the family wing of the mansion.
Ah, the New-blade has arrived. Give us the room if you would, Kor.
You choose death. So be it!
Don't mourn for me, Assassin. I've always dreamed of the Void.
What assurances do I have before I present your offer to the remaining Red Sails captains?
And the pardons we were promised? Much of my crew is wanted for crimes throughout the Gold Coast and beyond.
Lord Quintus! Intruders have penetrated the estate. We need to move the three of you immediately!
It helps me think! Now, where is the guildmaster? Or acting guildmaster? Or whatever you call it?
Falorah, my darling—I've been framed! I implore you to reconsider!
Release the gladiators!
What money? You lot have bled me dry!
No—no! I'm only trying to win back what I owe you. I promise!
<<1>>, good work freeing the prisoners. There are a few more on this ship—break them out and send them topside.
You have a bounty on your head—try to keep away from the Guard!
The elders are safe. Now we end this! We … oh. It is done then.
Nicolas would disagree.
Every time you help me, someone winds up dead. Couldn't you let me deal with this myself?
A touch of this, a pinch of that ….
I'm leaving! Please, don't hurt me! I'm never going to hunt anything again!
Allow me to assure you, child. You have done exactly as you were commanded.
The Grand Sermonizer is at it again, Matron.
Where you—you think … you're going?
Enough! I sheathe my claws and yield!
Largest, meanest troll you could find? I thought you said it wasn't dangerous?
Now back to the Sanctuary, my assassins. We have friends to remember and a victory to celebrate.

Patience, Brother. Let me consider the ramifications. Your connection to Lyra could be a boon in this matter, but it could also be a detriment.
Actually, this is one of Raz's good days ….
I'm sure your apprentice just ran off. Probably better she's gone when the killer comes around, anyway.
Become my champion, a sword of Akatosh—my Black Dragon that burns away evil's darkness.
I need a drink. Join me at the Kvatch inn and we'll say a proper goodbye.
Lords and ladies, don't be shy! Such an alluring dance is best seen up close! For a few gold, I'm sure she'll turn up the heat! Let's open those purses!
See that you do.
<Death scream.>
They're done! Another blazing victory for Ignaria Denian! What a scorcher!
Ah, Skaldeif, brutish as always …. Oh who am I kidding? Oblivion take that sour wench!
Let the games begin!
Cimbar's soul is with Sithis. His corpse is just bones and rotting meat.
A lesson Chanter Nemus will never learn.
You should wear nicer clothes.
But … I don't want to.
I understand. You name yourself the Black Dragon to frighten superstitious fools. Thanks, Hilde.
What does that mean?
Let me just finish recording the details of my latest contract … there!
All any of them talk about these days is the Dark Brotherhood.
A shame—it was lovely.
She can control when she changes?
I had some questions. Kor said I should ask you directly.
The Black Dragon's using shadows to track our progress.
This is still my kill, Assassin. When one door opens, the best course is to leap right through.
I look forward to hearing from her. Goodbye, Tsatva-Lan.
Hahaha! On to the next course!
Now, hurry. The power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can strengthen the Warrior's Apex Stone and weaken the Serpent's hold.
Great Warrior, I am your swiftness. Forsake this madness and ride against our enemy!
Go into the darkness and may your faith guide your path.
You see, I am not of this time. Centuries ago, I sought to end the reign of the self-proclaimed emperor, Tarish-Zi, by working secretly from within his royal guard.
Fate brought us forward together. We all heard the call to battle. Those poor souls you doomed to a cursed existence will be avenged!
The Anka-Ra. The self-proclaimed emperor Tarish-Zi's personal army. Each warrior pledged eternal loyalty to the emperor. The cursed form they wear is the mark of their servitude.
The Skystone Amulet was designed to capture the aetherial energy of the Mundus stones. You will need that energy for the task ahead. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I've already stayed too long.
See my newest creation!
Look. The seal activated one of the beams. We should find the other seals.
I'm no phantom, Kelmen Locke. I am the Celestial Thief. And you know why I am here.
Time is not on our—
Do not worry about me. I can reach the other aspects on my own.
Defeat the Lost One and we will do the rest.
You really showed up! Of course you did. I know how to pick them.
Slay the progenitor and its handlers, then check on the prisoners. If any remain alive, release them.
How do you do it? All this running around and fighting? I'm exhausted!
Oh, well. I tried. The better plan it is.
Well done! With the wards restored, those creatures should trouble us no more. Take a moment to … wait! It's aware of our presence. The fell beast approaches!
I have trained newborn cubs that hit harder than that!
The challengers stand victorious! Hold on, the Arena Master is signaling for a main event. Now the real contest begins!
If there's nothing else? I have urgent business in Tel Mora.
No need to confirm or deny it. We all have our secrets.
I wonder what Vvardenfell has in store for us!
Hist bless you!
Impossible. It can't be! We broke your legs!
This isn't what I expected. It's rather … small.
Yet we must decide what to eat.
You're one to talk.
What did I ever do to that Netch?
Watch for traps! I hoped they'd kill it, not us.
Keep your eyes peeled for traps, apprentice!
The Wise Woman … I was hoping she'd be here.
I'll perform a thorough historical examination while you … deal with any inconveniences that happen our way.
Did you see that flash of gold? A blessing from Saint Veloth for sure!
I think you're right, apprentice. There's no water down there. And I definitely see a gleam of gold!
Bah. Good riddance to bad scholars. Onward, to the prism!
Thank the moon and star, you've returned!
Brother, no!
Something's happening … I think you got it!
Yes, that's it! It's working! I hope!
There was peace, for a time. Then bloodshed.
I'm sorry for the delay. Getting the eggs down here was trickier than I'd thought. Greetings, Foreman.
That was your last chance, Revus. To Sovngarde with you and your schemes!
Well, I certainly didn't expect that ….
You'd welcome that Telvanni schemer into town after all he's done? You truly are a fool, Lathdar. To Oblivion with the lot of you!
We will review the request soon. In the meantime, continue your studies.
Whatever for? If anything attacks us, I'll protect you.
And this is why you've been so nervous?
That's … ambitious of you.
And now the crystals she was to procure for me have been acquired by my rival.
I—I've lost the mother of my children!
May purchase their own dwelling, with their own money.
Use Sunna'rah and … restore my energy ….
Sssh, Mils. I think this is a memory.
The ship's under attack! Pretend you're part of the crew and maybe the slavers won't notice.
Oh, that's a relief! I thought for sure you were going to kill me!
You presume to lecture me? You who conspired to kill my servant?
Damn! Those cat bastards are harder to shake than a blind date!
Delms! You can't believe these blatant lies about me!
Yes, Governor Salvi.
Master, I'm close to our goal! With Vivec's energy, I can open a portal and ….
What did you find there? A journal?
And you're sure it's Veya? House Redoran isn't emptying its coffers so you can chase your own tails out here.
How dare you!
Oh, it's you again.
Kill the intruders! They have interfered for the last time!
A moment, Governor. Here's my honorable writ of execution for the slaver captain.
Enough, Veya! This isn't the way.
More deaths, more blood on my hands. Just another day in the Morag Tong, eh hero?
After all that clandestine correspondence, it's a pleasure to finally meet you in person.
That would not be fair.
I know we have our differences, but I know behind all your gloomy, pallid, muck-speckled faces there's a hint of proud elven heritage.
Ah! This place is nice! Why has Jorunn not invaded it before?
My kingdom for a scroll of frost!
The long silent glowering?
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Llayne. You know I detest them. Approach, outlander.
Ow! Stupid dog!
I can feel it! Clavicus Vile is almost here!
To the ancient crypt! My next book is going to be a trilogy for sure!
W—wait, that's not how this is supposed to work.
All right team, we're packing up and heading back to town. Our friend will handle it from here.
So you're the mortal who gave my poor dog so much trouble. I suppose we should have a chat, you and I.
Do something, you s'wit!
The creature's death caused a change to the rift!
Their systems are beyond taxed. Reforming their circuit could overload them entirely!
I wonder if we could bring it here? Our mages are much better at discovering secrets than those glorified scholars working for the temple.
If you think you're being followed, find a place to hide. Good luck.
Allies on the enemy's back-line! Cover their approach!
The living serve, but the dead obey. You will find no sanctuary in these halls!
Usurpers …? In my hall! Let them come!
You don't know do you? I knew it. This is a disaster!
Every season, we share our bounty and select a new apprentice from among the novice apostles. By the way, where did my new apprentice wander off to?
Welcome to the Dwarven hold of Bamz-Amschend … such as it is. Ironic that Ayem's holy city of Mournhold has Dwemeric roots, don't you think?
Curious. Practically no one knows this route, but this scaffolding looks new. Built by rogue ordinators, perhaps? Stay watchful.
This lift will take us to the nethermost depths of the ruin, and to our destination. Come along.
We go where we please, wingless!  Go away, or we peck out your eyes!
Finally! Come with us, Lankin. We're getting you out of here.
Oh dear. That's not good. That's not good at all.
Here they are! Let me just scoop them up.
I do. That's what worries me.
More oil. Excellent.
We should return to the surface. This is no place for mortals.
Yes, this is perfect! My love will be so pleased.
No! It can't be!
Why, this blasted—I mean, no worries! I meant to do that.
The Skeleton Key, at last.
Slag it! Someone's breaching the Cogitum Centralis! I have to get back to the Basilica. Meet me there!
Of course, sir knight! How could I refuse such honeyed words? I feel a swoon coming on!
You told me to play nice with others! Now you complain? I don't have to listen to this. I'll finish exploring on my own!
I'm sorry, too. I said some things that were uncalled for. Unfair. That Neramo just makes my skin crawl, you know?
What … what have you done?
You're being ridiculous! Winding, tell him he's being ridiculous!
Amili was always very attentive in our lessons together.
I only know whispers …. Let us just be grateful for what we have.
Their giant felled the Guardian! Fly, Exarchs! Fly!
This one rejects that path! A life is worth more than a harvest. More than a hundred harvests!
But the plants! They'll die without the simulated sunlight!
What?
I already told you, you piece of scrap. Ain't no Daedra in Clockwork.
I can't believe she even went on the pilgrimage. Thought she had more sense than that.
My, my. Someone clearly didn't care for these factotums. Stay close.
It is … you're free now. I'm sorry for all the pain I caused.
I … I'll do it. I'll accept this fate.
Think I'm going to take a stroll. Little smoky in here. No offense.
Gimme a minute to cut this. Little boiler coolant gives it some bite.
The Aldarch! We'd better hurry!
This particular path is blocked by Daedric magic.
You are no friend to me, conjurer, but release those who walked with me in life and I will consider you an ally. Fail and we will have a very long time to become acquainted.
But the workers I hired? They were aboard the ship from Rivenspire!
Step away from that scribble, newcomer!
Raz doesn't care who you worship! He just wants to know if your cult was attacked recently.
I walked with gods. My mistake was believing I could keep up.
Saint Llothis, beloved of the Three. If any could claim to have known the hearts of the Living Gods, it was him, but for all his wisdom he couldn't see what had changed between them.
Caluurion, we've done as you asked. Tell us of Orryn's plans.
It may have been more fitting for the three Saints to depart as they arrived, in unity, but I'm glad Olms was not alone in the end. The burden of their existence weight heaviest on him.
The Court of Bedlam are cowards! They struck us down without warning.
Meridia, she calls to us!
Meridia, my Prince! She's gone! I can't feel her presence any longer!
Breath of the Tricky God. Breeze of the Far Shores. Carry away the lingering life that clings as Sep's skin to this world.
Silence or my webs will fill your pretty mouth next!
Took you long enough. I expected this rescue hours ago.
Simply unforgivable. You are henceforth banished from Rellenthil. Return, and your freedom shall be forfeit.
If you wish to speak on Larydel's behalf, speak. I have no time for games.
Then perhaps we can both be happy now, even if we must be apart.
Kindly leave before I have to clutter the place up with your corpses. I have more pressing concerns.
Enough, Silurie! These mysterious deaths are our business to solve, not yours.
And what are these two without the third? Incomplete. Ancillary. Superfluous.
Grand? Oh no, I'm simply Maestro Forte. Hardly worthy of the title Grand yet!
Fletch! Please, no!
Mephala, stop that! I've got him! Wait, what's—
Nocturnal? How dare you interfere!
The span between us may be as far as the sun and the sea, but you'll never be far from my thoughts.
What a shame. They never bothered me the last time I was here. What manner of illness has this cult created …?
No more stalling! Tell Raz what's happening at the Crystal Tower. Now!
Cleansing tides, answer me! Rage and drag this wretched place into the deep!
Hold, courier! I would like to have a word, if you would.
Ah, Vaerelel! I see you've deigned to step out of your florid abode. Come to see how a real artist creates?
I, well … yes. My apologies.
Did you hear that? Someone's in trouble! This way!
Tableau, what exactly have you gone and done?
I hear voices up ahead.
Fighters? What kind of idiots would come to this Eight-forsaken mountain?
Well, it's quite a privilege.
Secluded, cavernous—yes. This will be perfect for my research.
Pst. Over here.
Ugh. Disgusting creatures!
Wrong? Honestly, grow up, Vanus. There is no right and wrong—only power and weakness.
She did something to the controls. The gate won't open.
You can't make such demands. The Sapiarchs are the keepers of the Crystal Tower!
Our friend has proven their mettle time and time again. Raz thinks you should hear about these deeds.
Find me on Artaeum after you finish with the Eye of the Queen.
One, then. I'll be sure to report your compliance to the Divine Prosecution.
Vey Arillas! Abameld shauta!
It's like it's drawing its power from beyond the veil. Caluurion, can you help?
When I reach out I don't feel resistance. I feel nothing at all.
Who—who are you?
Destroy that creature and then I can contact my Prince!
Nasty, nasty …. She'll kill you all. Zaan the Scalecaller … will ….
A bargain is a bargain. The island for the Heart of Transparent Law.
Yes, yes, just as we agreed. But only a portion of the crystal. We don't want to alert the Sapiarchs too soon.
I promise, Val.
Not this again ….
It's not just superstition, Soravil. We need outside perspective.
See that you do. It'd be a shame for so many sacrifices to be in vain.
As I have said, the Proxy Queen is unable to hold an audience with petitioners at this time. There are other affairs that require her attention.
The same goes for me!
But alive, and together.
Enough of this for now. Let's see what our friend has learned.
SAT Music
SAT Music
For Summerset! For Sunnawel! For Sunhold!
Didn't you hear? Someone killed Admiral Viscarne!
These sea snakes will pay for what they've done to our city!
Interesting. You weren't this attentive when our daughter actually needed you.
Down here! I found something!
Finally! I've reestablished my connection to the rune.
The last font is just ahead.
I just wish I could have spent a few moments studying that inscription.
Give me a moment. I'd like to chat with our friend.
Remember to keep your cowl low, Miriya. Stay out of trouble. Be invisible. Survive.
You've been imprisoned in this mind trap by an entity called K'Tora. Its magic is powerful, but you're stronger than you know.
Parah Voleisto … the past revealed ….
Damn it, Talomar! You're going to reopen that wound.
The Justiciar's holed herself up beyond the caverns. We'll have to fight through a whole horde of yaghra to reach the fetcher.
Another breach by the sea! Ship's seen better days, eh? It's like I always say—the only thing you should make out of wood is nothing. Wood is ridiculous.
Definitely a breach nearby. And ooh, it's a rowdy one! This place is tense, eh? Might have something to do with the mountains strangling each other. Who's to say?
Oh, not you again.
What is going on? It was just a spider ….
Good news?
The day has come. This one will give up his life on the high seas, and settle down.
You again? All right, follow me.
The Ritemaster's waking up. You need to press on!
Breach ahead. Say, you think Josajeh's all right? I can't always tell. Your weird little faces scrunch up when you're upset, but then you bare your teeth when you're happy. It's a puzzler.
T1152 Hyircil Land Pain VO SFX
I expect we'll see more evidence of this malleable nature the higher we climb.
Ah. It seems the hunt must go on. Please excuse me.
I can't stand the idea of getting trapped in that vault again. Maybe I'll go to sleep. Yeah, a good long slumber to wash away the sadness.
Over here! We need to talk!
Is that a tomb? Don't put me in there! Please! No—No!
Everyone's gathered in the council chamber. You should go inside.
This way! Quickly! I can't hold this open for long!
The Staff of Towers! At last! Time is mine to control! You will not stand in my way!
We have to keep moving. The bailey up ahead is—argh!
No. It goes against my beliefs, but … I won't kill you. I can't.
Find a different patch of shade, ojel.
That's Dinia's sword! She loves that sword. Oh dear, oh dear, this is troubling. Come, let's hurry. I need to speak to someone.
Strange or not, Tsojei and I will kill anything that threatens the Remnant. Anything.
Hold on, Varo! We're on our way! Aim for the abdomen!
What were you thinking? Bringing this … this … thing here?
Many, many crocodiles.
Uraz! He's—
Our sap-speaker calls for aid. Several members of her sacred clutch remain. Find them, Mateem, and bring them here!
The Ayleid savages approach, but the Hist provides. A seed of our tribe. A refuge for the souls of our people.
I hope so. What I wouldn't give for a nice warm steam trap right about now.
Xukas should be along shortly … I hope. Argonians aren't really known for their punctuality.
Can you not hear it? It … rattles my fangs!
Yes. What is left of it, anyway.
Is someone there? Please, root-kin! I need help!
There is your gate, Xukas. To the Snake-Means-Death City, Xul-Thuxis, and the temple beyond. We challenge the Void here, sword-kin.
Gods! How much longer are you going to wait?
We do not mourn this loss, but celebrate the souls' reunion with the Hist, and all who have passed before.
I hear your words, Kishi, and my spines swell with pride.
Wamasu poo smells better and I speak true. Will it leave our village soon?
Search with your toes, Stibbons! Your toes!
Get going, Stibbons. And do try to redeem yourself this time.
Our visit should not arouse suspicion, we host many guests, but your discretion would be appreciated.
No, no. Our new friend has the situation well in hand.
The game is lost if the ball passes through the highest hoop. Unless the moons are both more than halfway full.
I know what you mean. Yesterday we received some sludge that stinks worse than a corpse. Whatever is that for?
Be careful when leaving town these days. I hear the Dead-Water are abducting anyone they find.
If a storm doesn't hit first. You never can tell when the weather will take a turn for the worst in these swamps.
Yes. By his guidance, Root-Whisper will one day prosper under a blessed sun.
Still, we have Jaxsik-Orrn to guide us. Under her leadership, our village will prosper through strength and force.
Truly? What was it? Daedra? Tree-Beast?
Of course, my beloved. But first, let us give them some time to collect themselves. Starting a new village is no small task.
A new Hist calls to me. I cannot defy its will. I must help a new tribe prosper.
Now that we've put Blackrose behind us, it's time to finally complete our mission!
All right. It is finished … Sithis, use me as you will.
I will meet you at the uxith. The nesting beds.
Examine that stone plaque, will you? Any clue will be helpful.
That was the Dragonguard! We're running out of time!
The Halls of Colossus? Arrogant Imperial! Without my assistance, you will never survive that place.
Curious ….
Hold, varlet! Don't you dare attach that foot to my ankle!
It is truly me, castellan, but I am Queen Khamira now. We will throw the usurper from my father's throne.
Head through the far chamber. I'll see where this door leads. Try not to wind up like those Imperials.
That's everyone. Tasnasi must speak with you.
That necklace must belong to Zinthia!
I warned you! Now the claws come out!
Report, Khamira.
Oh, hello! You always find things in the last place you look!
Ooo, how the moons twinkle in those glassy eyes. You want to stare off into space and time? I'll show you the future-past at present!
They spilled blood in this sacred place.
Sleek work, five-claw. Now, let's head back to Mother's farm.
Va qri jashiin ….
Now's our chance to end this, once and for all!
Lost and shattered light, come forth! Cast off your shadows and heed my call!
Still you hunt me, assassin scum? Was my death not enough?
As we expected. Now move. We still have much to do before they get here.
Now Dragonguard, you and your order die!
Sheathe your weapons, little morsel. Mulaamnir would talk to you.
You should have left me dead, Tharayya. I'll haunt you to your grave.
No adept can face the wastes alone, child. This one insists you stay.
See the trebuchets? Notice how they're aimed into the city below.
There they are!
By the way, if you see Pacrooti? Tell him he still owes this one a pouch of gold.
Your corruption runs deep, but her purity is limitless. You will be cleansed.
Oh, it means to resolve a conflict without violence. Yes, that's a good thing!
How beautiful! Why was this hidden for so long?
That's because it isn't, but it is a match to this tablet.
Psst! Over here.
Heed the third finger of the Whispering Claw: "distance is greater than any weapon."
You—you'll regret crossing Khasda!
After him!
Tasnasi will only make this offer once. Confess to the Stitches for all you have done and she will not try out your torture devices for herself.
The only way to prove it is to watch you die.
Keep running. It will do you no good. I will devour you!
We start in the temple garden, at the Pillar of the Spring Moon.
Witch of Azurah, where will we find the Dark Adept's orbs?
Leave while you still can, mortals.
Jora-ri hopes that Saviwa is a little bothered by the fact that he missed out on our royal treasure.
I refuse to die … near that assassin ….
Pardon the interruption, Queen Khamira, but that sounds like the Dragonhorn we found.
Off with you, Sugar-Belly! Now, another locked door, eh? I bet Marmalade could nick a key off that drunken guard.
Is this a lesson? If so, Zamarak is not sure what he learned.
Tharn! Can you determine where Cadwell disappeared to?
Why are you singing to my house cat, Luna?
I just wanted to heal them. Why … why couldn't I heal them?
How did you make something so terrible?
Stay back!
You killed until you died. They call that the oval of life. Or something.
You're a senile old fool, half-brother. How could you be so reckless? The Dragons are your fault!
Finally, I am avenged.
An eclipse is an eerie sight, but where are the Dragons?
The Dragonhorn, five-claw! Do you have it? Use it, quick, quick!
What?
Rarrrghh!
We did it! The necromancer has fallen!
We need to send your Cygnus Irregulars to the Moon Gate, Prefect Calo.
Good! Now put everything you have into it! Don't stop until you're dripping with blood and drowning in madness!
Are you ready? This is the best part! The killing part! Go kill the Xivkyn!
Oooh, my fur ripples in happiness. Euraxia, the horrid usurper, is deposed? There might not be enough moon-sugar in Tamriel to celebrate that.
Do not let them best you, Mulaamnir!
Kill the cats and the traitors!
I'm surprised that we don't see giant balls of fur rolling across the landscape here.
No. The fool's gone for the Dragon. You've got to stop him.
Dad'na fifeh'rai!
This one must warn the others!
Strun Bah Qo!
Such masterful strikes! But what if you are in distress?
This one does not see the point of such a thing.
Does it not entertain? What more reason does Khajiit need?
Stand back. Let me try.
Dragon's bones, we're up in the sky!
How goes the search? Come, tell me what you discovered so far.
Excellent work! Now see what you can find in the archives!
That Khajiiti ruin in the distance. A fine place for a Dragon to nest.
I see it! The Horn of Ja'darri is just ahead!
Vahlokzin is dead. We should return to the Abbey of Blades.
Hmm? Is something the matter?
Next time there's a Dragon, Za'ji does not want to be left behind.
Yeah, all seven of them ….
Of course! Followed him right to the harbor.
Use my glyphs to purge the blight! Just like before.
You amuse me, little insect.
What? You don't trust Za'ji to handle this?
These pitiful Dragonguard found only death in Vahlokzin's lair!
Well, that's one way to catch a thief.
Back on your feet, old man? Let me know if you need a litter.
Mending the tears will not be the troublesome part. This work will bear scars, but I will endeavor to make them enhance its beauty.
Wait for me to get in position. We should strike at the same time.
You think to challenge me, bug?
Hurry. It will take the last of my remaining strength to hold this open.
Didn't I say we'd find them here? Pay up, captain!
I'll find Marekki. You got my word on that. See if there's anything you can do for him, pal, then meet me at the ruins as soon as you can.
We must know! There's no work in Senchal. How will we feed them?
I know, I know. I just wish we'd gotten there sooner.
Excellent point. Hey, walker! Get us out of here!
He's much stronger here. He's trying to wrest control of Selene!
Orkey take you, witch-scum. You there! Kyne's breath, it's good to see a friendly face ….
Enough of your mewling! These slow-witted Nords pose little threat.
I'm glad to see you in one piece. Our initial assault … it didn't go well. I saved who I could, but these witches are dug in like hoarvors.
You did it! The bells are cleansed.
Well, I was going to offer you some of my sour guar shein. Four sixty-seven. Very good year. But I suppose I can find some rum? Just give me a moment. It's probably somewhere behind the sujamma selection ….
You are a terrible thief, Tender Claw. And with that eye patch, you do not even look like a proper lost kitten!
Their trail ends here.
Are you the herbalist's courier? Come inside. Quickly.
Fine. I shall make my way to Pridehome. For the sake of our alliance.
Khenarthi's sweet winds, Lorkhaj's black heart! Light to follow and darkness to thwart!
Hold your positions!
It is time, Ra'khajin. Sahrot sul. Show me your worth.
Look now, you're scaring the poor slaves!
A new champion walks in Ja'darri's stead. We can still make things right.
I am with you, my champion!
We can reach the surface this way. Let's move out!
Father? Wha—what's the matter?
She never wanted you.
Or your wretched wife.
She's forsaken you. But I haven't. There's a place in the Dark for all you cast off, forgotten souls.
You've seen it too, yes? That island off the coast with the weird lights?
An island in the sky! What could it mean?
Daedra? Necromancers? This one just knows she won't be sailing anywhere near the place!
There's only one thing to do. Let's drink to his memory. Excessively!
Let the light of truth shine through the darkness! Salvation lies with our Dragon lords!
Hold them off while I prepare the ritual!
Ah, the Dragonguard arrives.
Yes! We made it!
Walker! Over here! Malahbu is here!
Hurry, to the pinnacle!
Once it's ready, I'll test the elixir.
Empty? That's not right. There must be a secret passage. See if you can find it.
As long as everything's ready for the first harvest, Urgala, I will be pleased.
That—that was for mother. For Solitude. And for every soul in Skyrim.
Meet us at Fenrar's camp. It's the safest place for now.
We'll find somewhere new. If we stick together, we'll survive this.
Finished? Have you come to any conclusions?
That's Kasalla's warehouse. Only one sentry. Let's try not to cause a scene.
I had no idea such grand ruins stood in the heart of this place.
Damn, another dead soldier and no sign of our supplies.
Wait! There's a problem!
As evil lairs go, I'm not impressed.
You have the Icereach Coven to thank for that, werewolf.
Maugh, put away the tankard and get the supplies Fenn requires.
Everyone ready?
Don't be a fool, father! This elixir will save our people!
You make a grave mistake, trespassers. This chamber will be the death of you.
Open your eyes, Urzikh. It's too unstable. We can't risk a larger collapse!
You are not Zan'ikh … should I assume that you are here to kill me?
Press your advantage with a heavy attack!
Ugh … filthy. Wait, here we are. A medallion of some kind? Might prove useful eventually. You go on ahead. I'll catch up.
There you are! The coast is clear outside.
They should be just up ahead. Hurry!
A chillwind mushroom! And a fine specimen at that! Good work!
These tunnels look freshly dug. The Gray Host has certainly been busy.
What was that?
That sounded promising. Let's try the door.
All right. Search the tunnels! Let's find the others.
Tell me truthfully, Lyris … how much of this blood is mine?
The machine will finish him momentarily, my lord.
That's the tower Helsi mentioned. The Warleader should be nearby.
Stolen queen? Did he mean Bjora? We need to find her.
We're no match for that blood-drinker, but you are. Please … save our thanes!
We need to warn Jarl Olfwenn, so we're going to Karthald.
The Gray Host definitely has something big planned. Let's search the tents for a copy of those orders!
Honor to the fallen!
Whoa! Do you think that potion caused that?
Damn it, we need to save Fenn!
It's true, the Reach attacked Morthal! The jarl's soldiers put a stop to it, as I understand it.
Shor's bones, where are the guards?
I'm just glad it's over now. I heard the princess was forced to kill her own father!
She appears in good health and unharmed. I wonder where she was all this time?
Honor to the fallen!
Bah! Bloody mages and their bloody tricks.
So nice to be out with the ones that you love.
Adusa? The Khajiit? I know where she is, Elf! Release us and I'll tell you!
We need to talk.
Pull the lever once more, assistant. That should … that should reset the puzzle.
Hmph. Hardly the majestic retreat I was expecting. Wait. Look there! Another door.
Friend, see if you can convince Thane Hraldi to talk to us.
You could not stop the harrowstorm, and you cannot stop me!
Hmm. This one is so very thirsty … can we drink from him yet?
A bug, sire? Ah! D-don't come near Master Arkasis!
He moved so fast …. Just caught me by surprise.
East, down that tunnel.
Nope, nothing that way.
You sure you're reading that map right?
Heck of a guard dog. Take him for a run. I'll work on the door.
Over here! Nighthollow Keep is just ahead.
You're sure the keystone will power it, Belain? It must be ready when the time comes.
Verandis! What are you doing here?
Oh, Verandis, are you all right?
The tonal harmonics are in discord! Change the output!
You said it with such conviction, I could not argue. You have not forgotten our promise, I hope.
<STINGER>
Engage low!
Go to Valthume Barrow at once. This might finally give us an edge against the Gray Host.
We came to save you, Kathad. Talk to him, five-claw. I'll watch the door.
I'm more of a spy than a fighter. I'll shadow you on the way in.
The past is ancient history. Rada's intentions were to sway me back to his side.
Hey! Stop that! How dare you! I will not be thwarted by my own creations!
The Void energy is consuming you, Verandis. I can show you how to control it. Just follow me.
Music
That's a Gray Host pentarch. Probably after the same thing as us. What's that beside him?
No! I oversaw the placing of the offerings myself! It should have worked!
I knew I sensed … a friendly presence. Thank the spirits … for leading you here.
Let us follow their example. We have warred together, we celebrate together, let us rebuild together!
Heed our call, Hunt-King! Two great packs seek the same full moon. Make them one, bound by common prey.
A voidmother. We did not summon such a creature for this challenge.
Let us see … what do these entrails reveal of Namira's grand designs for you?
I won't forget this, stranger!
I don't like the look of this.
Hey you! What are you doing here?
Someone else wants the book! We cannot allow this.
You hear that? Well done!
When that time comes, I'll be right at your side.
Don't know whether it's Hircine's doing, but the scouts claim these wolves turned on their former masters.
Here it comes.
You did the right thing, Madearn. I'm happy for you. Truly.
Eslyn, I'm glad that we came to know each other. There is a future for our clans yet.
But who will—
It's a trap! Fight them off.
Shaman Ulvoch, I couldn't reach the wards, but I think this person can help us.
Do not allow them to disrupt the ritual!
Chiefs, please—ah! The outsider. I'll speak to you over here.
I gather he wished you well on your test, and that your death be swift.
Five relics decorate this shrine, for five are the Aspects of Lord Hircine.
Blade and arrow found him, time and again. Faolan did not fight to win. His aim was punishment.
But it did open the door to the north wing. I suppose I'll have to send you and the duplicates there next.
I'm going to kill you, Vandacia!
Not here. Let's return to the first hall.
Ah, the Wood Elf and the mercenary. Report!
You know about that?
Go fight the super powerful Daedric priest? How?
Thank you, friend.
Oh gods, help me!
You'll never take me alive, you bastards!
Well, never running is what'll set Lady Twilight apart from the rest!
Phalevon's horn, just as the stories described it! Did this Goblin sound the note we heard?
Fools! Nothing can disrupt this ritual while I possess the power of—
Go on, Calia. Unleash your power. Just like back in the sanctum.
Silly little brother. I'm the one who protects you.
Vandacia, a cultist? Gideon will help in any way we can.
Mercenary! Time to go. Through the portal, quickly!
I can feel the residual energy. Hold the skull toward me, please.
You! Oh, I see you well enough, Redguard! You think I don't notice the family resemblance? You stay away from my boy!
Gold! So much gold!
When you're ready, place a hand on Annyce's forehead and start counting sails.
I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back ….
My beautiful frogs! They've come home!
This portal shall take you to Elden Root. Do not dally. I sense there's more to this mystery than the politics of emperors.
Did you hear that? Phalevon's horn!
A close approximation of our calling card, but that entire pile is obviously a forgery.
I will finish what the Longhouse Emperors started, Lovidicus. I will set loose the power of the Four Ambitions!
Lord Dagon, hear your high priest! Send forth a champion to destroy these meddlers!
All right, Cres. I have a deal for you.
Gods, what is that?
Ha! Oh, by the gods. That one got me good! Well done!
Oh ho! This has Soars-in-Laughter written all over it! Ha!
Tiras … he's not gone after all?
There, in the distance—more Ayleid masonry. Finally, no more mucking around the dirt like some clumsy saltrice farmer.
Their high priest actually ordered them to kill us!
This door looks impressive. Let's see what's on the other side.
Look at this pedestal, it appears the Mysterium Xarxes would fit perfectly. Perhaps that is the key to unlocking the vault!
That matches one of these symbols. Keep going!
Oh! That's, uh … very generous, Tiras. Thank you.
Councilor Vandacia extends his welcome and bids you make your way to the audience hall.
I'm with you, my friend! We'll defeat Vandacia together!
What's that? Oh, feeling a bit better then? Don't mention it.
Once I get these Wood Elves out of here, I'll catch up with you!
You thought I wasn't prepared? Didn't you? Didn't you?
We're off. Stibbonses, stay here. Understand? Stay!
What are you doing? Stop it right now and perhaps I'll let you live!
Councilor Jirich was assassinated, right under the nose of the brigadines!
I have it on good authority that the mercenary killed Vandacia in a pitched battle.
Looks like they caught Ardia after all. We need to free her!
You all just get yourselves to safety. We'll handle the rest.
Whatever magic you turned on back there brought us some trouble!
Arrows! Nice ones, too. Why would someone leave these around?
I realize that, Scipion, but the Fang-Furls have us by the throat. What am I to do?
Come on, Ardia—watch your step!
I'm fairly sure Seeks ran off this way. Fairly.
Hopefully these bastards are as dumb as they look, and haven't found the ruins yet.
The people of Ca-Uxith honor you, savior of Krona-Konu.
It's our killer again! What's he doing?
Look! There in the water! Could that be it? See what you can find!
Just be grateful your little dispute didn't land you afoul of the law. Cease your meddlesome trespassing while you're ahead and get a real job.
Did you find it? Do you have my ring?
Woah, gross! Are you all right?
Stinger 3
Bodies? Of Imperials and our own?
Yes, fighting together! And their wounds were jagged, as if they were from mighty beasts!
Allow me to reward you for hampering our progress. You may listen to your brother's muffled screams unmolested as you stand helpless before this gateway.
I as well. Oh, I have so many questions for you! Did you know you have a niece and nephew to meet?
Oh! Yes! With your help that will be easy! How is this?
Interesting. A totem revering Mehrunes Dagon, I believe.
I'm Destron. And this is my sister, Calia. But who are you?
More dramatic, Destron. More … panache!
I have enough magicka to shroud myself from sight. I won't be far behind.
But Master Onimiril is gone now and—
Something tells me Onimiril's theory didn't pan out. Maybe be gentle with that box.
Ah, a good start! But let's see how you do with even more!
Just stay here until we receive further instructions.
Into the air with you, I command! There may be danger when you land.
If you come to any conclusions, do let me know. Ta-ta!
Still no sign of the Ambitions? Tangled roots, what a mess!
Vandacia should be just through that door. I'll cover you from the battlements.
I just want a moment to catch my breath and thank your friend here. Mother.
If you want my advice on carrying on our good name. You may come to me again.
Denied! Trespass no farther or you will be met with force, heathen.
Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!
Well, that's not the only disconcerting thing in the air. The seneschal's notes expressed concern with the knights' fixation on Daedric artifacts. The order even began deploying them in their crusade.
Lira, you are failing to shine bright enough. Rise and prove that you deserve that power!
Martus, we aren't prepared for this!
Ugh, there's so much … anguish.
It's coming from behind that door!
Another of those monsters!
A simple spell will keep the portal open. Mortal, this way!
Foolish mortals! You try my patience.
After the failure at the Dread Cellar, your Fargrave cataclyst must perform as promised, Celdina.
No one here deserved your pity. Save it for the poor souls being butchered in Cyrodiil.
I'm ready when you are. Lead the way, friend.
Sombren, no!
Blocked. But see that tower? We have to find a way to reach it.
Hmm, a map? It looks like the inside of one of those doomvaults we found. Hang onto that.
We should go, too. I will summon a portal to take us to Fargrave.
Nothing but a waste of time. Just more of the same. Secure the Durance Vile until I return.
Now I shall activate the portal key. There! Step through and assume your role. I shall do the same.
In here, hurry!
Search the cave, master. A mortal died nearby. I smell magic, too. Dark and strange ….
We're following … your daedrat?
There are only two stones left.
Lyranth, what are you doing?
Nokvroz used that portal, master. His scent lingers.
Your mortal hubris amuses me, Celdina, but Lord Dagon has no further need of you.
Waking Flame, protect the votive runes!
Why, Lyranth, my dear, it would be an honor to assist you in any way I can.
I'm sorry, Lyranth. I need to do this.
Well done, rat. Mortal, find out what else the note contains.
Much too rich! But can you handle … this?
A part of me, but also a part of something else. I think that's how we recognized each other, Sombren and me.
Rally! We can't lose to these heathens!
I agree. You defeated Mehrunes Dagon, that's incredible!
But games are some of my favorite activities, dear Lyranth! Come, let me show you what the House of Whims has to offer.
Damn it, they found us! This is not your concern!
Mafremare! To me!
The Warden's Overlook is nearby. The entrance is a portal. We might find the location of Elegian's Durance Vile there.
Keep going. Nearly there.
We should leave, too. Quickly, mortals, into the portal!
Relax, mortal, I have you.
Remember, mortal, do not range too far from me, else I cannot protect you from the summit's elements.
You know, I can't recall. Must have been those knocks to the head.
I wonder how many souls are trapped in this place.
Hold up. These aren't some old soggy papers. These belong to the Ascendant Order.
And here I thought they setup this whole hideout just for me.
Give the poor wretch their pet back. Their sniveling is staining my expensive shoes.
This bag looks promising.
What did I tell you?
We came back voluntarily. Did you have to tie these bindings so tight?
It no longer amuses. Gazmod has grown weary and departs now.
A respectable attempt, Skrix. But it will cost you.
No one knows. Or no one's saying. But Mehrunes Dagon is calling every Daedra that can swing a sword to his throne.
Fool! You cannot stop what is coming!
Now, what should we do with Joset? Hmm?
Sombren will save us!
The masked one speaks true. We need charged lucents.
Is that right? Seems a bit one-sided to me.
Whoever managed that got through walls of steel and stone to do it. They're a clever bastard.
And a marked one.
Ha! Hahaha! At last!
Now!
Poison flooded the shell. But from what? Last, the blue plant.
Poison beneath the skin. The entry point. We must talk.
Perhaps the Dagonic relics lie beyond that door.
I—I must obey …. You will not pass!
Lyranth, huh? I'll help you look! Let's meet at the Plaza of Portals in a bit to compare notes!
Good luck, everyone. Remember, the future of Tamriel is at stake.
How many of your heroic plans don't end with you tied up?
Each delegate carries a medallion like this one, Magus. It serves as both an invitation and a key.
Wait … that crest is mine, but the necklace is not. Who are you?
Ah, there you are. Go inside and talk to Captain Kaleen. Find out what happened at sea. I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
All we've got to do is break a curse that's hundreds of years old. Then I'll get my fortune. It'll all be worth it.
Is it done? Is the medallion safe?
Like a book, dear.
Just one more time you had to get me out of a jam, huh?
No time for books today, my darling. My friend has a favor to ask, so play nicely.
We've got it! Draigh, let's get out of here.
Oh dear. I think he's just over there.
Then add them. I'll tell you about it later.
Stay back! You … you're not one of those slimy druids. Who are you?
Nonsense. I refuse to hide from these cretins. I'll double my guard, but they won't drive me from my home.
Why must we sit on our hands? The Dominion can crush the Ascendant Order with one fell blow!
I'll get to work on the traps for the motes! Good thoughts only!
No. No, my dear friend. You need to finish what I could not.
Take the items back to Mandrake Manor, my friend. I can do a more thorough examination there.
For now. I just hope we don't regret removing the binding wards. I guess we'll have to wait and see.
I had to do it, Roslenn! It was the only way to guarantee their recovery!
You bastard! What have you done with Lady Arabelle?
<Hadolid rumbles calmly.>
Hey, you, let's talk while Magister Irin collects his thoughts.
That's father's voice!
Guess my ancestor really did meet her end around here … but still no sign of her or her treasure.
Return to the manor. Lady Arabelle must know of this. I'll return as soon as Islinne can travel.
This is defeat? I … hate it.
You constantly underestimate me, oh love of my life. Here, let me just cut these ropes for you.
All right, my minions, gather up the treasure and let's get out of here.
I'm grateful for any information about the fates of my friends, old man. You've been a great help.
I will, I promise. And then we'll be back to eat all your bread, just like the old days.
Our service here at the Gateway Inn is second to none.
What can I say? I haven't changed a bit. Talk to our friend here about what you found out. I'm going to watch our backs.
Look for a mammoth ear plant in the woods near the manor. We need to wake her up!
Meet me outside. We can talk there.
It worked! She's awake! I was a little worried that she might be dead.
<stinger>
How about that? The raft worked. Let's move inland and look for Anton.
There she is! Who's that with her? He looks familiar.
Yes, thanks to my extremely kind companion here. Aurelia … what am I going to do with you?
No sign of any plans up here! Oh, you bested that ghost! Good!
Nilsmon, when you wake up go back to Castle Navire. And Stendarr's breath, take a bath! Woof.
Hmph, overgrown kindling. Za'ji! You all right?
Psst. Over here.
Isobel! Oh, I've never been so happy to see you. Quick, untie me!
Awww. Poor Rocky. All I wanted to do was ride him, but he didn't seem to want that.
This jungle is dangerous, Caska. You and your friend shouldn't be wandering about.
Ah! Careful there squire! Don't let the branches snap back! You've scratched my armor!
That hilt must be around here somewhere! Get to work!
This little beauty will help us immensely, you'll see.
The second exit is unlocked! Exit to complete the trial.
Here we are. I'm going to cast a little purifying spell while you place the crystal so nothing disturbs us.
Come on, just one more match. Give me a chance to win my gold back!
An elder? And the mediator? I … I don't know what to say.
Well done! Now's our chance! I'll seal the fissure for good.
It's not what you think. You don't want that. Please, just take Zalezu's money!
Hey, of course! Just trying to help out my friends. No worries, all right?
I don't sense anything. Maybe the old man was bluffing.
It seems safe so far.
I am Dreadsail, born of the sea. I cannot be defeated!
You finally came, but I'm gone!
Don't leave me!
It's your turn to suffer!
I said get to the crow's nest and spot us a break in this storm!
I'm here! First, we need to set the ritual flames. There's three around the site.
The sky … it's clearing ….
There's the Silver Swan, moored out in the bay. Hurry! If they set sail, we'll never catch her!
I'd like to see you try—ayyy!
Look at Y'ffelon in the distance. I've never seen Mount Firesong so active.
Jakarn, help me sort things out here. We must hold the castle until help arrives!
Serve the crew of the damned!
Time for your belongings check, Yvara. Don't mind us.
That's it! Your status as a trusty is revoked and you're going to processing!
Ah ha! Oblan left us a trail. This symbol means he went north.
I'm … capable? Does this mean you'll let me go on adventures?
Hello? Please, help me!
Aha! There's Nilsmon. Over there, on the beach.
It would seem my bad luck has rubbed off on you, Ly.
That can't be good for them ….
Ha! Look at what the senches dragged in! This one is sorry you had to make such a long trip just to lose.
Kra! You are better than this one thought. But one victory means little, yes? Neither of your friends will best Raenobi.
Barging into a lady's private chambers. You are bold.
And you, Ayrenn. Nice … cat. I say, friend, let's chat.
Caska will run ahead and clear the path. I'll make my own way there.
A dedication ceremony? For me? How exciting!
Until next time, my friend.
Stibbons! Come here, my manservant. All this foolishness about forgotten love has given me an itch. I am in need of a good scratch.
Another tremor. Step carefully, dear.
The Ascendant Order will expect us to reinforce All Flags Islet.
Did you hear? Lord Bacaro's conference. It's peace talks to try to end the Three Banners War.
You … beat me.
No! I can't fail now!
That should be enough.
Oh, fish biscuits, the smell is going to make me throw up. Almost done.
Use your medallion! It's the only way past the wards.
Quite a victory—and a truly joyous reunion. Here. I believe these cards will be a welcome addition to you collection. Farewell.
We're near the shore now. Maybe tunneling here angered the Hadolids? The entryway has to be close!
By the Eight you're right. Self-pity serves no one. Young lady, Kiv has gone to Belkarth. Let's go.
Meryline? The Hadolids. They attacked. Your father—
I am sure there's a story here, and I bet it involves Aurelia. But for now I'm just so glad to see you.
A fire burns deep beneath High Isle. The druids of old channeled its power … a dangerous temptation.
Dreadsail Reef is just a short swim off the starboard side. Through the mist. Good hunting, marines.
Pathetic weaklings. Fight!
Hang on Song! We're coming!
Those cards you drew can trigger a combo. See how they have extra effects if you draw another card that matches their suit? Luckily, you bought cards with the suit you need to trigger these combos.
Your blood is MINE to command!
I should've asked before—you can handle yourself in a fight, yeah? Eh, I'm sure you can.
Hey! Over here!
Any resources you have at the end of your turn will be cleared once your turn is over. Except Prestige, that is.
I'll be back.
Well, gentlemen, shall we?
I have the Air's sight. I have the seed. You failed and all that's left to do is die!
Blight and thorns! Please, friend, talk to her and find out what happened.
Firesong camps, on the mainland? We need to figure out where they took Wyress Tola.
The Glenmoril Wyrd, hmm? Let's discuss our next steps.
We could bring Frii to the Mages Guild. I'm sure they'd be safe there, Laurel.
Here we go! One Y'ffelon Surprise! Enjoy, you two!
Spirit! Stop. Please stop!
I hope that fissure calms down. Let's go.
Sacred seeds? Laurel said the Firesong were after the Stonelore seed at Earthen Root Enclave. What does this have to do with the Druid King's visit to the wyrd?
Just as I suspected, a hidden door! Let's see what other secrets this manor is hiding.
You defeated my champion? No matter.
All these plants were recently torn away. This door must have been hidden for ages.
The ritual is complete. The spirit, it stirs.
No, you cannot summon the spirit! It's not time!
Unwise. The constructs react poorly when you remove their energy supply.
Quickly, please! Save Octin, too!
You return. And with the key, I hope!
Thank you. Now let us speak without the bars between us.
It's good to see you, dear! And is that Count Stefan? Glad House Mornard could join us, your excellency.
Is that you, dear? I still need rest.
Come, dear, we have plans to make.
Ah, found my shirt! Oh, now it's wet, too.
Locked by ancient power, but the stones sing me the key. Find the three druid stones nearby and wake them, Laurel-friend.
Its final act was to release you, dear Gwen.
Go have fun with that behemoth while I regain our bearings.
Take a look at that pile of paper.
Damn their eyes! They ransacked the place. Let's see if the case is still here.
Mercenary, up here! Captain Uldiss entered the next courtyard. I leave her to you!
When the lava flows, the Alliance Leaders will die!
Ah, Dhulef, our friend returns! But where are Laurel and Frii?
Wait! What are you doing?
Another marking. Examine it, but watch out for the Firesong.
Someone approaches. Don't let them reach the ritual site!
The Ivy Throne. Careful, friend of Laurel. I sense a powerful guardian nearby.
He joined with the spirit. Now the volcano will follow its nature. It will explode.
Quickly, friend. Place the gauntlet and crown to form a ritual circle.
Now Frii is the spirit of Mount Firesong. Now the volcano will be still. Goodbye, friend. And thank you.
Yes! Burn, burn you bastard! Thank you, my friend!
But I—yes, archdruid. I understand.
Captain. Captain look! I'm tough!
Well, never mind then! I suppose we're doing this the hard way.
Thank you, friend. Archdruid Orlaith has already started her ritual! We have to get to the tomb!
Your stubbornness is misguided. I will have your blood!
Intruders? Here's how we deal with pests in my garden.
Sir Balnon told me how insistent you were, Galphen. Called you a royal pain in the arse!
Was all this bloodshed really the result of a druidic prophecy, Galphen?
You're back. How did the meeting with Count Stefan go?
Friend, let's clear the deck!
Now this council suffers the wrath of the Firesong!
Well met, noble Numinous! May Xarxes, God of Ancestry and Secrets, commemorate you! In this hour the Altmer need your aid.
His Captain of the Guard was a werewolf? I knew Blackmoore was brazen, but that goes farther than I thought even he dared. Good work. Should anyone try to make the Baron seem a victim, this information will remove any question of his guilt.
As you can see, your deeds  precede you. The Kinlords and Kinladies sent Emissaries to pledge their support.\n\nIt has not been easy for me to steer this course. I am grateful for all you have done on my behalf, <<1>>.
I-I don't know. When he heard the cavern collapse, he declared 'mission accomplished' for the Ironhand Ogres. \n\nBut then he ordered me to muster the troops and prepare to march on Wayrest!
What do you want me to say? \n\nI'll give them their land back and compensate them for this … minor inconvenience. After that, I'm leaving! I refuse to live in the mud. Emeric can find a swineherd to rule his pen of pigs.
We cannot rest upon this victory, however. Much more must be done if we are to conquer Cyrodiil.
It is an honor to lead this army. No challenge is too great for our warriors. I foresee the day when the Covenant banner flies over all of Cyrodiil!

I am too … now.\n\nIf you would though, I still would prefer to keep this quiet. I do have a reputation to uphold, you know.
Today guards, tomorrow their leaders. We may call on you again soon.
Perhaps there will be gold and silver to be had along with that stone.
You did it? Excellent. That will put the fear of the Ebonheart Pact into them.
With fresh supplies of lumber at our disposal repairs to our keeps will be that much easier. You have proven your worth to the Dominion.
You have done adequately. Every enemy dead brings us that much closer to taking control of Balfiera Island.
With the Ebonheart Pact busy replacing their losses; we have time to plan a decisive attack against their leadership.
Sacrificing our own people! This monstrosity must stop!\n\nThe commanders at Davon's Watch must see this immediately. And … and I must tell them about Giron.
I will make this gift, this sacrifice. Trees, plants—one day it will all bloom again. Blood is water, water is life.\n\nMay the Hist embrace you.
These don't look like my pants, but thank you for finding the axe.\n\nI wish I could find that witch and teach her not to tangle with <<1>>!
We still have plenty of work to do. Without reinforcements, these troops won't last long. And I'm sure Serien won't give up without a fight.\n\nThe real battle has just begun.
That Covenant general is a monster. Thank you, soldier. We'll ensure the dead rest peacefully.
<<1>> claimed he saw House Dres poison our Hist Tree. Then he gave a bottle to this tree-licking waste of flesh.\n\nI smell worm scat. Someone has been playing us for fools, and I no longer believe it's House Dres.
I don't know. I only know what the reports tell me.\n\nGiron probably took Ralden somewhere secluded, far from prying eyes.
Said he stirred up trouble with some mercs and had to leave town. Asked <<1>> to take over his shop, permanently.\n\nMentioned you, too. Said he'd pay you extra for your silence. Said you were smart enough to take a hint.
Partnership? Not much choice, is there? We can aid you in exchange for our lives. We can help you get our treasure for One-Eye.\n\nIf you're on One-Eye's good side, this is better for all of us.
Hmph. Normally I wouldn't be quick to believe such a tale, but the book Saryvn brought back seems to support it.\n\nTake this for your efforts. Leave Saryvn to me.
So you helped out <<1>>, all by yourself?\n\nThat's the best news I've heard all day. If the lot of us don't die tonight, I'll buy you a drink.
I'm fine, though my silk doublet is ruined.
And won, apparently.\n\nSpeak with Gaston. He'll want to know his spell can be completed. It's just as well. That beast needs to be contained. And I still want to split Gaston's skull open for sending us down there—if it weren't for you ….
Thank you, stranger. \n\nWith this dark act behind us, we can get on with our lives. No Elves will own me or my family again.
Here's something we found near the ruin. Please take it for helping us.\n\nYou know, you're not bad to have around. Feel free to come dungeon delving with us whenever you want!
He's alive, though? Ayem bless you, my friend. I'll get things squared away here and make my way to the tower.\n\nI can't believe my fortune, running into you here. Thank you for your help.
Don't be silly. Ah, here it is.\n\nTake my wand. It worked better for you, anyway. Remember me when you use it.
Thank you, sir! I'll be returning home, shortly.
Good, without their leader they won't be summoning anything.
Sorry for the pain, just give me the reward.
That's a relief! Dremora can't be killed, but you've banished her from our plane for a time; thanks to you we can breathe a little easier today.
Droi's fate is in Kyne's hands, but his chances are better now. I'll continue to watch over him until he wakes up.\n\nSince he was here before us, it's possible that Droi knows what happened to the Keepers. We need to find out what he saw.
Wonderful! The refugees will be delighted. I'll find out who these items belong to and hand them back.
Well done! Once banished, the Dremora will never be able to return to Nirn. \n\nThank you for your assistance. I hope this ritual will somehow make amends for my part in this whole sordid affair.
Joyous news! The Green Lady must hear of this. I sent a Jaqspur scout to her when <<1>> returned, and now we must send another with this report.\n\nYou've done us a service, and have our deepest gratitude.
My uncle lives? My father's mercy knows no bounds! \n\nYou've been by his side and have persevered when others would have faltered. From now on, you shall be known as the High King's Arrow, for you lead the way and always strike true.
Good. I lit up a few of the rowboats myself.\n\nA job well-done, but don't let it go to your head. It'll take the Maormer a while to recover, but they will. We must be vigilant.
Every tale has an end. Every end allows a beginning to set hold. It is a balance, tenuous though it seems to be.\n\nZ'en's presence fades from this world as Mauloch grows stronger. Perhaps these journals will give comfort to those who fear the end.
After that story, I think I might be the one who needs a drink! Well, thanks for the information. I'll make sure to look into these accusations as soon as I can.\n\nBut you're not going to give up on this, are you?
The Dreamwalker is already inside. Let the monks know you bring the ritual components. \n\nI must be off. Fildgor is on the run and we're closing in. Now go. Save the King so he can lead us to victory.
Jakaral. The skalds! They're trapped. Trapped in the giant camp!
We storm the castle and the realm beyond. This one imagines Estre is very upset. She threw in her lot with Dagon and now ….\n\nNow nothing stands in our way.
Good. Thinning their numbers keeps them under control, as much as anything is under control around here.
In some cases I'm taking a preventative stance. Hopefully that will stop the spread of the disease. \n\nThe gods thank you. As do I.
My men and I will go round him up. I can't believe we took a contract from a damned deathlover.\n\nThank you, traveler. Stars guide your steps.
As am I, my friend. But there is much to do. \n\nThe Worms hide inside Trolhetta. Mark my words—Mannimarco's spawn dies today.
<<1>>! Yes, it's one of the relics the Reach stole from us during their raid. I never thought I'd see it again!
I was right about you. You're strong. But you can't bully me into forgetting what's important.\n\nIf you won't help me, I'll save Falinesti by myself!
Truly, I am glad. She was very lonely, and for so long.\n\nBut enough melancholy, yes? To our spoils!
So it was Hald? Damn. He was tortured years ago, in Daggerfall. I don't think he ever recovered. That's no excuse for treason, but it still makes me sad. \n\nThanks for your help. The Pact appreciates your loyalty.
So you have chosen. So shall it be.\n\nYour allegiance has been pledged to Thallik Wormtongue.
Yes, I know you must have been concerned about the messenger. He made it through safely.
That Sea Drake attack was the last straw. Iriana and I are going back to town and not leaving until we find a ship off this damned island.
Truly? This is wonderful!\n\nPlease, accept a meager payment for your trouble. And if a strangler-infested marsh doesn't frighten you, perhaps we should speak of additional work.
Listen, I thought I contracted corpus from the Skeever cookies she gave me last year! She'll be fine! Thanks again, that was a great trick. I'm sure Baan Dar is well pleased.
Well, that's perfect! Get me out of here and I'm at your service. You'll find me a man of many talents!
Remarkable! Really, just amazing! You're the new Champion of the Blessed Crucible, inheritor of the Brimstone Crown! \n\nLet all in attendance know that the Champion walks here. Let no one bar your path!
<You open the treasure chest, revealing the riches inside.>
Ra Gada or not, I owe you a debt for returning my shield. Don't think I'd be able to show my face in Windhelm without it!\n\nI've been in this tiny village long enough. It's about time I get back out there and knock in a few heads!
Thank you. It seems silly to worry about books at such times, but I would hate to see Goblins destroy our heritage. If those books were lost and Goblins overran us, no one would know we were ever here!
Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … and Mathal's, wherever he may be.
Moons be damned, I will get my sister back. I don't care what that moldering old ghost says. I'll walk the Path with you, cut Tharn's throat, and come back with an army of mages to free Shazah from this torment.
This mission needs a leader. I want you to lead the assault across the Chasm.\n\nWe have asked so much of you and you have already accomplished the impossible, but you are one of a very small few that I would trust with this task.
I will. I can't wait to see him again.\n\nPlease, take this. It isn't much, for I could never repay what you've done for me, but I hope it will suffice.
I knew you were the one I was waiting for!\n\nWhatever your purpose here, I can help you. Especially if it has anything to do with ruining Molag Bal's day.
Truly? Well, at this point that should come as no surprise. Nonetheless, I will wait until later to give him this news. \n\nHis Majesty is dealing with a crisis here in Sentinel. You might be able to help him … if you are so inclined.
Long may you prosper, wayfarer. You have lifted a great burden from me.
You're always welcome here, warrior. But now, others need to speak with you.
A priestess of the … all right. Hey, we need to get things done here. Whatever brought you up the road, I'm not going to complain.
Took your time, didn't you? Olvyia mentioned she sent a recruit to fetch these. Since you're here, we could show you the siege weapons.
Battle is the best teacher, warrior. Accept missions posted to the boards, experience the lands of Cyrodiil, and advance the Covenant cause. I suggest you start with a Scouting mission.\n\nHonor and faith be with you always!
You've done my people a great service, friend. You may stay and learn the stories of these people with me, if you desire.
Much needs to be done for the Pact to control Cyrodiil. I send the most urgent tasks to be posted on the mission boards for all to see. Scouting missions are best to start with.\n\nWelcome to the war.
The Maormer are fled or dead, thanks to your efforts. <<1>> is safe, and voluntarily a part of the Aldmeri Dominion.\n\nSo, if you must know? <<2>> keeps an eye on promising people.
Bright moons! It's been a privilege to fight by your side. I know now why Rid-Thar would choose you. Why he appeared to us. You are the Moon Hallowed. You must be!
I've always been too hard on him. He's found a beautiful wife, and he's always cared for Father, all these years. He has done well for himself.\n\nFather would be proud.
Thank the Eight. The army here is greater than we anticipated.
Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands.
I suppose I might be able to. I would need a little blood. Stibbons, hold out your arm. This won't hurt a bit.
No matter what the future holds, Evermore is deeply indebted to you, as I am too.\n\nIn times like these, we all need a hero like you … to remind us that no matter how bad things get, there's always hope.
I know you will—I'm counting on it. Without you, this castle would already be flying Imperial banners. \n\nYou've saved the kingdom, and now its queen. If there's one person I believe in, it's you. Still, I don't know how we're going to do it alone.
No one else should suffer my folly. Thank you, and please take this for your troubles.
Consider it returned. The grotto belongs to the Wyrd once again, but more importantly, to you.\n\nI'll be watching you, mortal. A larger hunt looms in your future, one I'll watch with great interest.
Yes, of course. To Oblivion with this whole campaign folly, and the Seventh Legion. \n\nAs you can see, my men are securing their gear and preparing for the march back to Cyrodiil. It's a long journey, but it'll be good to fight where we're needed.
My plan worked! I sent the caravan containing <<1>>'s wine down a road frequented by the bandits, in the hope that they would steal it and fall under its curse. Thank you for clearing them out.
After I return it to the Orrery? Perhaps I can research its properties once the ceremony is complete.\n\nIf the queen allows, of course. I'm not one to stand in the way of royalty.
Dominion correspondence? Let me see ….\n\nHa! The guard's failure to protect our citizens is already the gossip of Stormhold. Why not Elven spies? Dark times, no doubt about it.
Thank you. Thank you so much. I promise you, whatever efforts I made to redeem myself before, they will be doubled.\n\nEvery hour, for the rest of my life, I will try to earn the reprieve you've given me.
We have no purpose, so we will return to our vigil. Our directives render us dormant until circumstances again warrant action.\n\nI have no sentiment, but I do have memories, and I will remember you and what you have done here to protect the Valenwood.
Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as an Associate of the Fighters Guild! Get out there and take the fight to the Daedra!\n\nYou're in luck, comrade. Sees-All-Colors herself is here today. Why don't you go introduce yourself?
So you saw everything there was to see, eh?\n\nWhat do these mages keep up there? Giant rats from their experiments? Ha! I'm joking—don't tell me. I'll see for myself, soon enough.
A death, and an unrequited love. Sentimental, and unimportant. \n\nBut you have fulfilled your part of the bargain, so here is mine: there is a man who can help you defeat the Anka-Ra. His name is Titus Valerius, but he is not of this time.
<Attached to the bounty board is a message from General Dar-Liurz:>\n\n"Your prowess in hunting enemy Nightblades has gained you great renown. On behalf of Grand Warlord Zimmeron, I leave this reward for your efforts."
Hah! Of course! We reward our own. Take your key. Enjoy your well-deserved cut. And remember to come see me again tomorrow!
Beyond the eternal gratitude of maidens snatched from the jaws of death? Oh, I think I can manage something shiny for their gleaming savior. Hah!\n\nYour key. Your cut. Now how about celebrating with your new friends before dawn brings new challenges?
Then take your key, and your cut. I am glad it was you that laid Nerien'eth to rest, Undaunted. When we speak again tomorrow, I hope it will be of happier times.
Your wit and wisdom deserve nothing less. Take your key, and your cut. Rest well this evening. And return tomorrow. Pit your wits against death once again.
Interesting scent. Do I detect a hint of wamasu? No, that can't be right.\n\nNot how I'd do it, of course … but interesting enough to pass certification. You may now fulfill provisioning writs. Keep your pots warm and your ladle clean.
You've outdone us, friend. You've reached the heart of this Citadel before the Undaunted.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, but we'd like to give you something special to commemorate your feat!
Yes. And with that beast Rakkhat killed, it will stay that way. Well, Adara'hai can hope, yes?\n\nThank you, friend. When Jone and Jode cry out for a hero's song, this one will sing your name.
The quest is now complete. You should still be on this layer until leaving the subzone.
<The military provided a satchel of Clothier supplies as payment, along with a note of thanks.>\n\n "We once again stand in awe of your intricate designs and attention to detail. You have our admiration and our thanks."
<The Guild provided a satchel of tailoring supplies as a reward, as well as a note of thanks.>\n\n"We had more than a few Daedra ask where we got our clothing—before we killed them! Thanks."
<A crate labeled "Crossroads Profiteers" waits inside the box, a note attached to one side.>\n\n"You have a flair for metalworking. And we appreciate your craftsmanship. You have our thanks."
<The military provided a crate of Blacksmith supplies as payment, along with a note of thanks.>\n\n"Never doubt that you do as much with a hammer and anvil as our soldiers do wielding your arms and armor. Thank you."
<The organization gathered enough supplies to offer you a Woodworker's Case as a reward. They also included a note of thanks.>\n\n"You have our thanks, crafter. These bows guarantee that we'll be able to keep the least among us safe."
<The refugee organization has scrounged a coffer of rewards and left a note of thanks.> \n\n"Know that you have given more than material goods. You have given hope. Please accept our gratitude, what little it's worth."
<The Dragonstar Trading Company provided a coffer of supplies as payment, along with a note of thanks.>\n\n"We deal with a lot of crafters, so take this for what it's worth. Your glyphwork is among the best we've seen. Thanks."
<The consortium has left a pack and a note of thanks as a reward.> \n\n"Our Dominion arm thanks you for broadening our palates and our profit."
<The Fighters Guild has set aside a pack of supplies and a letter of thanks.> \n\n"Nothing like a hot meal and tasty drink to remind you of home, and a future free from these bastards."
<A chipped vessel holds your payment, Alchemy supplies scrounged from the battlefield. A note is attached.> \n\n"Who says there are no heroes left in this time of war? Your contribution means everything to the least among us."
After I make sure we get back to the clan safely? Maybe I'll go and see the new city they're building. I've heard it's quite grand.\n\nIn spite of my mistakes, we got the Riekr's totem and saved most of the hunting party. Thanks to you.
Excellent. This will buy us some time. If the Dragonfire Cathedral actually exists, we need to make sure it doesn't fall into Molag Bal's hands, right? Yes. \n\nTake this for your trouble, and stay in touch. There's more to Molag Bal's plan, I know it.
You're dubious. Skeptical. That's good. All I ask is that you consider it and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon.
You've done us a tremendous service, friend. There are still many lost souls bound to that wretched place, but we can be proud that at least a few have made it to the Ashen Forge. You have my thanks.
It seems your work was far from perfect, but a life is a life.\n\nReturn tomorrow. The truest path to improvement is practice, and the Night Mother provides ample opportunity for that.
The deal is off, but it's no trouble, boss. I'll find another outlet for these goods. <<1>> always comes through.
You did more for us than anyone in this wretched city. Raynor and I will do our jobs and complete our contracts.\n\nThen it's off to Hammerfell! There are ruins to explore, adventures to partake in! I'm all tingly with anticipation!
Taka? Bakhum thinks not. He does not thrash and snarl like the others, but his eyes seem lost at sea, yes? This one will return him to his family. With time and good food … who can say, eh?\n\nTake this, friend, and may Baan Dar dust your tracks.
They tried to make a fuss about the traces you left during the job, but <<1>> knows the value of a little blackmail to ensure the agreed upon price.\n\nYour share, boss. It may not have the beauty of stones, but I find the jingle quite fetching.
Their eyes shone brighter than the stones themselves. It was a simple thing to get them to part with a little extra for the flawless services you provided.\n\nYour cut, boss. Enjoy.
Hard to picture a noble wearing this, isn't it? I thought so too. Her husband was a pauper. She had more wealth than he could dream of, but he insisted on buying her ring. Can't put a price on that.\n\nSee you tomorrow then, if you're available.
No kidding. Did you rob a whole troupe or something? Maybe they'll think twice about mouthing off about us in the future.\n\nHave a night on the town courtesy of the guild.
Cut the head off the serpent—Lizard? Whatever—the body dies with it. The Xit-Xaht are scattered and leaderless. They won't be bothering anyone anytime soon, even if they do survive.\n\nYou earned your key and cut today. Do it again tomorrow.
It seems your work was far from perfect, but a life is a life.\n\nReturn tomorrow. The truest path to improvement is practice, and the Night Mother provides ample opportunity for that.
See that Titus makes it to Belkarth. The Star-Gazers will give him refuge. I feel he may still have a part to play in our struggle.\n\nContinue to work with Hara of the Star-Gazers. I will reach out to you again when it is safe to do so.
That's good. Don't know what's inside and I don't really care. All I know is that the client is willing to pay.\n\nHere, you earned it.
Then our Glenumbra chapter can breathe easier. The turmoil in their region will keep them busy for quite some time. Best the Worm Cult isn't a part of that turmoil.
So you brought some much needed joy into the dour lands of Stonefalls? This is why the Lava Foot Stomp occurs each year. At least for a time, the warm feeling comes from within—and not all the nearby volcanoes.
What a relief. With Mistress Dratha's approval, I'll send runners to nearby towns and let the people know it's safe to return. Thank you, my friend. Truly.\n\nTake this. And I believe my Mistress Dratha would like a proper word as well.
That sounds like my Narsis! Always wanting to explore just one more nook and cranny! I assume he'll be along shortly for one of my shoulder rubs.\n\nAllow me to pay you for your service. It is the standard rate for Narsis's apprentices.
This was not your fight, but you chose to take it up when things were most hopeless, and turned our darkest hour into a victory. If that isn't the work of the Divines, I don't know what is.
Finally, a competent worker! You'd be surprised how difficult those are to come by these days. You should sleep better knowing that creature won't be ruining anymore careers. And I'm sure the extra gold in your pocket doesn't hurt either.
Well done.\n\nHow easily our people forget the past. How eager they are to bury it in the endless ash. We never forget. We never forgive. Now take this, with our thanks.
<He notes your work and tenders payment.>
<He notes your work and tenders payment.>
Oh, I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but first I'll need to expel Orryn's soul from the Dragon. I'm sure our new compatriots would love to settle their unfinished business with our host.\n\nWe should be able to handle things from here. Thank you.
The Precursor mentioned he was made of Clockwork and Dwemer parts. I'd keep an eye out for the former as you travel around Clockwork City, and search Dwemer ruins out in Tamriel for the latter.\n\nAnd of course I have your reward, as promised.
Heart. That's not something you hear a lot about in a place that runs on gears and cogs. Here, this is your share of the treasure. You earned it.\n\nThe people of Slag Town have a new future to forge, thanks to you.
There's a whole world beyond these walls. I think Lotus and I are long overdue to see some of it.\n\nI hope we cross paths again along the way.
You've been an able guide to heroism. Keeping me on the righteous road in the face of adversity! When I sing of the divine messenger who set me on this path, know that it's your praises I sing!\n\nOh, I like that.
Normally, I'd dispatch every soldier at my disposal to deal with these geysers. However, the ongoing war has depleted our forces. It might be time to reach out to more people like you and Cainar's adventurers.\n\nFor now, take this with my thanks.
<The refugee organization has scrounged a coffer of rewards and left a note of thanks.> \n\n"Know that you have given more than material goods. You have given hope. Please accept our gratitude, what little it's worth."
Study it, obviously. Very carefully, if that's what you're wondering. I've been doing this long enough to be cautious with my meddling.
I do not know. I must reflect on this.\n\nStill, I thank you for all that you've done. You saved my companions, found my egg-mother's research, and helped the oasis begin to heal. No small feats to accomplish, traveler-friend.
Yes, you are right. Silhu-jo was a good Khajiit, but I cannot live within these walls knowing that we denied their security to people in desperate need.\n\nThank you, walker. We only just met, but you are the closest thing to family that I have left.
For now, help the Khajiiti prepare for the Dragon invasion. And take this as recompense for your service.\n\nIn the meantime, I have plans to formulate and arrangements to make. When the moment to deal with the Dragons comes, I will contact you.
A senche tiger? That's remarkable! If he managed that, a frog should present no challenge at all!\n\nThank you so much, walker. When I publish about this, I'll be sure to mention your contribution. Ha! I can't wait to see the look on Caldathir's face!
Excellent! Please, speak to my associates and they'll help you get started.\n\nHere's a small retainer to keep your interest. Generous, yes? Ha! Good hunting, walker.
If the full might of the Icereach Coven wasn't enough to stop you then I'm not sure what will! Here's your key. You earned it.
Now we're talking. I mean, it's an expression. I'm not just narrating what's hap—forget it. If we're lucky, these papers will tell us what the New Moons are planning.\n\nI'm giving you this gold for a job well done. Dammit.
Phew. Guess the Dark Elves did bury them with it. You just been lugging it around like that? You're as bad as Za'ji.\n\nI won't dock you anything for leaving it to me to clean up, just this once. Here's your pay.
Haha! Earned our pay with this one! Would you look at that? Even got pictures. The old beard is gonna love it.\n\nGo on and take your pay. I need to show Sai all the important work I—we—been doing.
<A scrap of paper is pinned to the crate.>\n\n"Nordic tribes living in Skyrim's harshest environments thank you, and we wish you a fruitful New Life Festival." — FC
Shor's bones! Don't have to be a wizard to feel the magic on this. Thank you for bringing it to me. I'll hand it over to the town's clever woman for disposal.\n\nWe owe you a debt, friend. Take this. You more than earned it.
Unlike Gwendis, we can't rush off without a plan. Clear heads will win the day, mark my words.\n\nThis contest is far from over. With a fresh trail to follow and new allies at our side, victory is closer than ever. And much of that is because of you.
There you are, just in time. Hopefully these specimens will be enough to satisfy my contacts.\n\nHere's your cut of the reward. And come back later. I'm sure to have plenty more work for you.
Then may your message reach Aetherius, traveler. I'm glad to have been a part of your celebration of the Old Life.\n\nTake this. It's my gift to you, in the spirit of the tradition. Something special, so you can remember this Old Life day.
Impressive. If we can keep this up, the Gray Host will learn to fear us in time. Eventually, the few that remain will scatter into the dark like roaches fleeing the light.\n\nTake this. You earned it, harrier.
We are all in danger. At least you kept the Ambitions safe. I thank you for that.\n\nConcerning the cult, Eveli and I have made plans. But first, I want you to have this. Compensation for the work you have done up to this point on Blackwood's behalf.
I think we can all walk away from this. We ship Quistley home—secretly. Then we make sure that Tenarei has something she can take back to Larz-Tul.\n\nThank you, friend. I think Lord Silvelle would agree that you've earned your payment.
Oh ho! You bring Jad'zirri a heaping handful! Something she can really dig her toes into! Don't worry she strains the juice very thoroughly. No choking on claws, jaunter.\n\nBut let us get your own juices flowing. Take these as your just reward!
Yes! I want to write, and travel, and feel the rush of romance every time I slip on this ring! Mathen and I have so much to offer one another.\n\nIt will be a little weird, yes. But like I said before, who wants normal romance? Certainly not me!
I thank you. It was a grim and dangerous task I gave you, but it had to be done. The families of those Ghemvas killed will be glad to know those souls are at peace.\n\nTake this, with our gratitude. We'll have more work for you soon.
Well done. The goods you brought back definitely will help us get that new portal up and running. Maybe there's even enough for all the experimental magics that Vares Dredayn has been asking for.\n\nHere's your reward.
Precisely! Here. The favor I said Zenithar would bestow on anyone who assisted me in his praise during this day. The lord who looks fondly upon labors of love always shows good fortune to those who learn from him. \n\nGo, with Zenithar's blessing.
We find a way to make a life on this island. From what I've heard, finding a way off is nearly impossible.\n\nHere's the payment I promised. I guess we'll probably run into each other again some time. Amenos isn't that big and we're all stuck here.
Of course you did! I had great confidence in you. Let's hope the Sable Knight's horrible curse is broken for good.\n\nTake this, with the gratitude of House Dufort. I'd say you've more than earned it!
I knew you were the right one to send to Glimmertarn. Thank you for helping Laurel. You're a most valuable ally. Here, take this. The least I can do for your continued efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll make sure Rahval and the seed get to Vastyr safely.

I hear the Nords don't have warm blood, like we do. How else could they live in a place colder than this?
The fish aren't biting. I think they sensed trouble in the water and moved offshore.
I don't think you appreciate how awful my situation is. You probably live like this every day ….
My mother is doing a bit better, now that she has that amulet.
I like honey. And mead. Mead!
By the gods, that smells awful!
It is a good day to fish!
Damnit, woman! Why must you be so loud?
The festival's brought many new faces into Windhelm. I like it!
Over here! We need to speak quickly.
I'm waiting for Idesa to finish a piece for my betrothed, but she needs to concentrate on her work. She's been a little too preoccupied with that Dark Elf noble, if you know what I mean.
The beach is littered with bodies.
Eyeballs are soft and oh so delicious!
Why can I no longer sense my sister? What evil has befallen her?
Maybe I just need some new bait.
There's so many expensive things here!
For the Veiled Queen!
Giron and Ralden used to be such good friends.
Damn House Hlaalu!
These refugees don't make our work any easier.
Die!
Sorry. I don't take requests.
If lumber shipments don't start flowing soon, I'll never get the manor roof fixed.
The sea has been kind to this one.
These aren't normal Goblins. I've fought Goblins before. They weren't like this.
For the knights of the king!
I just want this to be over!
Well fought, for a maggot.
That Tamien Sellan fellow turned out to be all right.
You don't belong down here.
I'm sorry, brother. So sorry!
Children of Lorkhaj! Begone!
Get away from me! I don't have anything for you!
Famazar wishes he had his wares. Even Worms need new clothes, yes?
You can't expect me to perform under these circumstances!
Don't give in, Hrolvir. Takes more than this to kill you!
In case no one else has said this, we really appreciate the help you gave us.
I thought those terrible Red Rooks were never going to leave.
Gonna fall on your face if you strike like that!
Those Heritance imposters were insults to the Thalmor tradition.
Die priests! And now … rise and fight!
Come now, friends! Have you seen Jurairia's latest shipment? Don't push, don't shove! She's got enough for everyone.
Hmm … the cycle of the two moons seems to be the key to dispersing the barrier.
Mmn.
The Stonefire Cult should have been here by now. Where are they?
The tents are on fire!
Get that lizard away from me!
What's Ranneth doing? Untying the mage's wife?
I hope we will not have to stay here long.
Ahhhh!
First this one needs more coin. Then this one pays debts!
This would go faster if you actually helped you know…
What is a sailor without a ship?
I'm a sailor, not a fisherman. I wish we never came here.
Is it true the Dominion has paid Altmer to come here? That's no good.
It's about time we had a real city in Valenwood.
I fear I will never be able to get all this sand out of my ears ….
We're blocking the wings off until we finish clearing the bodies away.\n\nWe can handle it from here. Valenwood thanks you, sincerely.
You're lucky we haven't hanged you. Yet.
Destroy the body, and the animus is cast into darkness. But the animus returns.
Augh! Stop biting me, lizard!
That's the fire I'm looking for! Stand back. I shall prepare the core.
Welcome back to the Boast!
Hail, Vestige.
You fight like Mezha-dro's mother scolds. Using all five claws.
That's all you can manage? I'll kill you myself!
This equipment is for heroes of the Dominion. Have you earned it?
My brother was in Longhaven when the mist set in. Thank the Divines you were there to get to the bottom of it.
Just enjoying some time alone. I'd rather keep it that way, thank you.
I was thinking of preparing something special tonight. Something to make the taste buds tingle. But I don't seem to have any kwama livers in the pantry.
What a mess. This is just awful.
I told you it would work! Let's find the others!
Let's go.
I've no idea how long things were cooking in those ruins, but it's boiled over into quite a mess. Quite a mess, indeed.
Taking stock of our supplies is a touch depressing. We've got less of a presence than our stores would suggest.\n\nIt feels wasteful. But, if reinforcements arrive, I suppose we're prepared.
I have, in my many years, traveled throughout Tamriel and … tasted nearly everything that could be brewed into a potion.\n\nYou may benefit from this experience: I know more of alchemy than most alive today.
What was your name again? Target practice?
This. All that's left of my research. I had it all when I came down here, but most of it's been burned. No matter, no matter.\n\nI'll be on top again. I'll set back into my position, and everything will be set right.
No! No! It is not just terrible, it is awful! This simply will not do!
Why does she look like me?
Weakling!
Baron Dorell is so … reckless. He needs to be more cautious, like the Countess.
Damn! We were almost there. Keep trying!
I feel safe enough in the Hollow City, but I don't think we should linger here too long.
I told you to keep your head down!
I cannot control my creations!
Fall!
I could kill you myself, but I have hungry souls to feed.
Been days since we've seen an ore wagon. Bah. A mine's just a hole in the ground if you can't trade what you chip out of it. \n\nBeen hauling red brittle just to make ends meet. That's how desperate it's gotten. Damned Iron Orcs ….
With the mine closed, we only have to work when we want to. That gives me much more time to work on my epic story!\n\nI'm going to be a famous storyteller, just like Veesk-Olan and Fjokki the Bard.
Plan to compete in the Arena? Well, mind the traps. A spike in the arse will kill you just as dead as a sword in the belly.
Death has not yet claimed you. That is good. Take the pledge, and we will see how the day ends.
It's done! Now hold that position and split your group to clear the other side!
What a strange place this Arena is. I'm sure it wasn't here when I visited the area a year ago.
Everyone's got a story to tell and I'm here to listen.
Orcs. What a fascinating people! If they were of one mind, I dare say they'd be unstoppable!\n\nBut I digress. What can I do for you?
You nearly missed the delivery. I'll try to send it out today, but no promises.
May I help you?
Fish and ale. That's what our clan is known for. The draugr? That's just a distraction.
Unless you are a trained gladiator, I would not suggest entering the arena.
You're going to need equipment. What do you say?
Thanks again for bringing me this book. I'm hoping if I show it to the magister, I can be apprenticed to someone else.
The Emperor summons his subjects!
Rise up, old bones!
If there is more work, then we need more thralls.
If you're looking for Captain Caudex, good luck. Like a ghost viper on a moonless night, that one. Turn over the wrong log and you're dead.
My collection of mortal parts shall grow this day.
What is this for? Oh right! Bounty.
Another tramp dirtying up my streets. Typical. Just pay the bounty and be on your way.
This is entirely your fault!
Stendarr's justice must be done.
There is a protocol that must be followed in these matters. It starts with you paying your bounty.
We can do this the pay-your-fine way or the tear-you-to-pieces way. Your pick.
Begone from my sight.
This should be easy!
Good decision. On your way now.
Very satisfactory.
Guards, to me!
I love it when they try to run!
This one thinks you ugly and stupid, like all muskarse criminals.
This one believes you should be punished, since you were stupid enough to get caught.
Then we work it out in battle!
Pay the bounty and get out of my way.
My tired feet thank you for cooperating.
You did good, pup.
No one ever wants to pay!
I think I have to kill you now!
Have it your way!
Hey! Yeah, you! I saw what you did. Pay the fine or face the consequences!
Next time you will not be so fortunate.
Master Otholug is our chieftain.
Help!
Do you think I care what you do?
Why would you do that?
Lorkhan's bloated belly, leave me out of this.
What savagery!
Don't even think about it.
Unbelievable. Guard!
There's a blood-drinker here!
In broad daylight?
My pleasure!
You can't escape, criminal.
Go. Lay aside your misdeeds.
Was the crime even worth the effort?
Hands off my valuables.
Keep your hands where I can see them and we'll have no trouble.
Bark and birth! Guards, come quick!
Please. Let me just drift away.
Where did it go? I just had it.
Very well, I'll barter with you. But I'll also keep a close eye on you.
You should've left long ago. Now I have to call the Guard.
You're fine. I won't talk.
Away from me, pickpocket.
What? Who? I'm going to scream.
Hey! That's not yours!
I won't say anything. Promise.
Stay back now.
You're a sharp one all right. I won't report you.
I can't believe you tried to rob me!
What're you up to?
If you want to talk, clear things up with the guards.
Hmm. Guess I need a tighter purse.
Take your murderous ways elsewhere.
Not 'til you've paid your bounty.
Do I look lonely to you? Then why are you still here?
Did that person just turn into a wolf?
Guards, help me.
Think you're clever? Think again!
Just go. Now.
It's none of my business, that's for sure.
Guard's on their way. Get out.
How could you? Someone, help!
Wolf! Werewolf!
You've got some nerve showing your face around here. Just do your business and move on.
Break it up, you!
I didn't see anything! Just leave me out of it.
Stay back!
I didn't see anything!
You're in trouble now, pickpocket.
Why would you take that without asking? Are you mad?
Pay the bounty and come back. We can talk then.
Step off, skeever!
Let's just forget the whole thing.
Halt, damn you.
Dumac take you, criminal scum!
Your name is cleared, so what can I get for you?
If you do that while I'm watching, I'm going to have to take action.
Whatever you're planning, you won't get away with it.
I asked nicely. Now the Guard can deal with you.
What do you think you're doing, s'wit?
The Guard knows how to deal with the likes of you.
Try that again and I'll stick your head on a pike.
Caught with your hand in the proverbial honey jar--again.
Bah. This one does not care.
Dark moons. There's a thief among us!
Where did that get to?
Stay away from me, you vile murderer!
Don't kill me. What will my senche-tigers do without me?
What did I do to deserve this?
You skeeving wretch!
Back on the bright moon's path, yes? This one is glad to hear it. What can I get you?
Don't let that dungy thief get away!
This one says stop!
Is that your hand in my pocket or are you just trying to rob me?
I see you have reformed. Good. Let's talk.
Glad to see you're reformed. What can I do for you?
I can't talk to you while there's a bounty on your head.
Blood makes this one sick.
This is not my problem. Do not involve me.
I have no stomach for suffering. Leave me be.
I saw what you did and I called the guard.
I keep my own counsel.
Shor's bones, where are the guards?
It's a mangy werewolf.
Kyne sees what you did.
I wonder if you'll be so bold when the guards arrive?
I'm glad you paid your bounty.
I knew you weren't a criminal. You're much too attractive.
Hey! No fighting here!
There's laws here. You break them, you pay.
You won't get my blood! Guard!
A vampire--get the damn guard!
Do I need to draw you a map? Get out of here.
That's just wrong.
Don't hurt me! I might look brave, but I'm actually a coward!
You had to ruin my fun? All right, go.
I'd expect that from filthy orphans, but not you!
You have innocent blood on your hands.
Do you ever get the feeling your goods aren't exactly safe?
Don't try it. I'm not a guard because of my winning personality.
Somebody ought to smash that thief's teeth in.
Guards! Vampire!
Now that that's cleared up, what can I do for you?
Leave me alone, you monster.
I saw that! Guards!
You're under surveillance, citizen.
Damn. Must have dropped it somewhere.
Touch me again and I'll have you in irons.
Mauloch's jawbone, what have you done?
That's the killer, right there!
Get your greedy fingers off me!
It's my duty to maintain order here.
Did someone just … no, must be imagining things.
Won't anyone help?
I found you!
What is that?
Stop at once!
Zeht's tears, help me!
Worthless gadabouts. Don't make me throw you on your arse.
By Ruptga! A thief!
I've no time for thieves and jackals. Make your purchase and begone.
Do what you must. I don't care.
You and I should just keep our distance.
I have nothing to say to you right now.
Aren't you a tall glass of mead! I hope you came to see me.
You Enforcers are great. I'm thinking about leaving the Guard and joining up!
Well, look at you! I hope you're here to see me, Enforcer.
I pay top coin for contraband. I wouldn't dream of shorting you and pocketing the difference.
Stop, criminal scum! Nobody breaks the law on my watch. Pay the fine, or I'll cut you open.
Cherish my mercy, citizen. It is a rare thing.
You there! Interested in hearing about something new?
No criminal has ever escaped my wrath. I'm just that good.
It's hard to earn a living when the Commander won't let me have a real weapon. Can't be too careful, he says. Not since the "mammoth trunk incident," he says.\n\nWho knew the sword was so sharp? You make one mistake and it follows you forever!
Finish me, scum. End this … this farce. If you don't, those skulking Imperial scouts will.
Don't matter what you say. I'll never tell you where the bodies are buried.
I guess you'd say I clean up messes. Make certain problems go away. I specialize in bloodstains, if you get my meaning.
I wish Lord Ethian would make a decision. If Lady Sovelle were here, we would be half way to Orsinium by now.
No! You no crush me!
Traitorous Orc! Accept Trinimac or die!
Don't you tell me how to drink my life!
I have to find this relic. Our future depends on it.
Mazgroth? Is that you?
A challenger approaches! Prepare the monstrosities!
Ha ha!
Got nothing to add to the wrack yet, <<1>>. Looks like you're having some luck, though.
Normally I only mix potions and salves for the clan's benefit, but since you've already interrupted me … is there something you need?
My clan-mates are … not enthusiastic about my work. You might see them spit on me or the equipment. All in good fun, though!
I'll stab you in the eye for that!
Impressive huh?
Mephala take you!
The Reach will not be kept from their lands for long. I will destroy all who stand in our way!
I'm just here until I can fix my wagon. I do have some fine armor if you're in the market.
This one does not accept barter of meat and bone. Gold, only.
Undaunted! Undaunted? Dauntlessly spend your money here, friend.
This one has many fabrics to offer. See how they glint. A true bargain.
Let's go find some treasure!
I almost left all this behind me. I was half-way up the boarding ramp to a ship bound for Highrock when I decided I wasn't done with Abah's Landing quite yet.\n\nI want to make the Iron Wheel pay for what they did to us—I want them to pay dearly.
Hurry, friends! The breach is near to breaking!
What'll I do?
Anything for the guild's finest.
I will feast upon your life!
I used to be the cook on the pirate ship Strong Wind, but I much prefer preparing food on dry land. If my pots and pans are going to spin around, I want it to be because I'm drunk and not because the sea is choppy.
This way! Hurry!
The guild coffers are really starting to fill up. Wait—don't repeat that … I'd better do another count.
The way you drove your blade home, that was a magnificent kill, Silencer. Artorius experienced the requisite amount of fear, anger, and pain just before you finished him off.\n\nGood job!
I'll have no trouble. The Red Sails guaranteed a safe haven to do business.
<The Kvatch bounty board is neatly organized, displaying odd jobs from private citizen in an orderly fashion.>
Don't kill me.
If you're looking for work, shove off. Got no room for unhinged adventurers on this boat. People like you bring nothing but trouble.
Your blood and water are mine.
Let that meat rest!
Dinner is served!
This won't take long.
Best lighten that purse before someone puts a hole in it. Let's make a deal!
I hate waiting around! I didn't march half-way across Cyrodiil to fight practice mannequins!\n\nIf we don't get to kill something soon, I might have to go pick a fight with the Blood Feathers!
They're off their leash and out for blood!
They're off their leash and out for blood!
It's you! It's really you! I hope to prove my worth by showing you something truly special today!
A reputation clings to a person like mud clings to a boot. Always make sure yours is a good one.
You're building something of a reputation, aren't you? Good for you! Now, what can I sell you for your home?
Finely engraved, solid and sturdy. Nice polish, too. Here's your fee.
<humming>
This doesn't look right.
Pay no heed to these Telvanni charlatans. Join the Mages Guild and learn from the true masters of the arcane arts!
I am not worthy to wallow in the mud of your greatness. Even so, I have something special for your home.
Ularra's a dangerous place, but you look like the type of warrior who can hold your own. You might just come out of these old ruins in one piece.
Why anyone would want to fight in the battlegrounds is beyond me. Who would want to waste their life in combat? I much prefer scientific debate.
Since the Pact ordered all slaves to be set free, everything has changed. Oh, I still work long hours and get told exactly what to do. But at least now I get paid for my efforts.\n\nThat makes all the difference.
One of them is overcharged!
It isn't that Serabhi wishes to steal from a god. She just needs to get by, like everyone else.
I'm glad an outlander such as yourself is taking interest in silt strider traveling. You'll find it far more reliable than your typical caravan.\n\nWhere would you like to go today?
Let the games begin!
That's a good showing!
Keep up the fight!
The battle shifts in our favor!
The taste of victory is sure to be sweet!
You make it look so easy!
Shields at the ready! Protect the relic!
Those milk-drinkers! They have the relic!
Somebody pick up the relic!
Such clumsiness! They've given up the relic!
The relic is dropped! An opportunity!
We seized the relic!
We have captured the relic!
Their lives are forfeit! They've taken the relic!
Our moons grow darker!
We can do better than this!
By the glory of claws most sharp! We've captured the point!
They could've at least put up a fight! We've taken the point!
They have secured the point!
They took the point!
We've got the ball! Sharpen your claws for another round!
For honor and blood! Defend that ball!
The ball is ours! Raise your swords to the sky!
Grab that ball, fast!
They only care about smarts up here. That's why I'm trying to educate myself.\n\n"Amelioration," the act of improving something. Word of the day, free of charge.
Before you ask, no, my packs aren't flame or acid resistant. They're just packs, for Mauloch's sake.
No requests coming through at the moment. Check back later.
What, are you afraid of Nanny finding out? You're an adult now!
Oh, my poor right arm. It's going to rust at this rate, what with all the steam! Quick, you'll find it in southern Bangkorai. Grab it before it's too late!
Ah, the pleasant sensation of Riften grass on my thigh. I'm tempted to leave my left leg there, but my gyroscope is calibrated for two lower limbs.
This fetching city ….
Resident in distress. Physical assault in progress.
<NO SOUND>
<NO SOUND>
On to the new capture point!
We must capture the new point!
Hammer and spit! On to the new point!
Rally to the new capture point!
Now, to crush Scalecaller or see her bow before me?
Some hero.
I'm the Dragonslayer! You're worms!
Thought you had me!
Tell me when to unleash Dawnbreaker's power!
Ah, another member of the disadvantaged masses, washing up on Summerset's shores. As Queen Ayrenn commands, so shall it be.\n\nI just hope you have gold. This is still a business, not a charity.
I never expected to live long enough to visit—let alone work—in the Alinor Mages Guild. The High Elves have a rich and ancient magical tradition. I hope to increase my knowledge while I'm here.\n\nIf I can find mages willing to share, that is.
Ah, a fellow egg-sibling now living among the haughty High Elves. Tell me, are they treating you all right? I have heard stories that make my scales go dry.\n\nStill, a practitioner of the arcane arts could find a worse place to wile away the time.
I'm from Daggerfall, so I don't care if you're a High Elf or the king of the Redguards. If you have the gold, you get the drink. Simple as that.
Glad to see a friendly face! Who knew there'd be so few of us on this island of arrogant High Elves.\n\nHey, if you're interested, some of us are getting together for a forest festival out at Archon's Grove. You're more than welcome to join us.
Oh, a High Elf. So special. Think your dung doesn't stink, do you? Smells like rainbows and moon-sugar, yes? Well, a pox on you!\n\nNow, what can this one help you with today?
Oh now that's a pretty jaw. I'll make something nice out of you.
You seem quite dedicated to your tasks. At least you're good for something, newcomer.
Ebon Stadmont may not exactly be bustling with business, but there's a fair amount of traffic along the outskirts of these woods.
Finally! Hircine's boon is mine!
The Kinlady is about to learn that it's hard to talk down to someone with your face in the dirt.
The Elf thinks she can talk down to me as long as she's smiling. But she's just showing me which teeth to knock out first.
Allow me to introduce Reefhammer, the bane of Ul'vor-Kus!
With a port city like Lillandril, you can expect the occasional Maormer attack. We don't get it nearly as rough as Sunhold, though. They're usually the first to be hit.
We'll draw up the plans immediately.
Fivefold venerations, Emperor. The winds of Cyrodiil speak of your deeds, but those winds do not blow in the Battlegrounds. I shall look forward to facing you.
The entertainment provided by outsiders must be placed under strict scrutiny, lest we allow corrupting influence to take hold in the isles.
An honor to see you, Emperor. How can my humble shop be of service to one as great as yourself?
It's not often a warrior of your esteem visits our camp. How can my humble shop be of service to your home?
An honor to see you, Emperor. How can my humble shop be of service to one as great as yourself?
Imbeciles. Despite explicit wording in the ordinance, I've still uncovered seven different crates of netch eggs. Do people not even read the statutes?
Am I ever happy to see you! I don't get a lot of customers out here.
Before you ask, yes I've been cleared by the Sapiarch of Oceanic Occurrences to fish. All my casts are perfectly legal. \n\nIf you're looking to fish, take it up with the College.
It seems several of the dockworkers prefer to work without shirts on. I believe I'll be spending more of my days down here.
For all their poise, you'd think the High Elves would have their house in order. But between strange geysers and sea-monsters, this island is as bad as the continent.\n\nSo I'm looking for new members. Interested in joining the Fighters Guild?
How dare you close Z'Maja's gate?
Our battle isn't done, Silaeda!
You'll pay for harming Falarielle!
Psijic Domino Pigs are quite intelligent. I've known some who could even count to ten! And they all recognize their name, given enough time.
When you reach the pinnacle of fame and fortune, commonplace items just won't do. Of course, my furnishings are far from commonplace.
I'll show you why I'm the one who runs this prison!
You'll threaten Vykosa's pack no longer!
Don't you see? You're the Hare now, hunter!
Guards! Empty the cells!
<Low, quiet snarling.>
Well done! We've found the indrik!
So many lovely dryskins coming into Lilmoth lately. It's unfortunate so many scorn a scaly touch. Ah, well.
A blessing from Lord Hircine! Fresh blood to hunt!
We can't allow Z'Maja's gateway to remain open! It must be collapsed from within.
Seems like every lizard in this swamp is whispering your name! And as such, I have quite the collection for you to peruse.
Though the Argonians may be obsessed with impermanence, I assure you my furniture is built to last.
I am curious … do the Daedric Anchors not come to Murkmire? Or do they simply sink into the swamp?
That's all I've got for you right now, but come around tomorrow and I'm sure there'll be something that needs doing.
Your blood gives me strength!
Your coin purse? It is I who found it. And so, it is now my coin purse.
We are touring Black Marsh, my lady. Black. Marsh! How could you not expect such things?
Kud-Mere tells me I am bossy, but this is not true. I simply know what I want, and I grasp it. Much like I wish to grasp your disreputable goods, walker.
Perfect time to rally with some companions and conquer some… random foe.
Why won't you just go away!
I've been having dreams lately, of a tower exploded and a city in ruins. Fine time.
When do I get to hit something?
The catapault cabbage can knock a full grown Saxhleel right onto their tail. If they cannot be avoided, it's best to move swiftly past them.
Hold on, hold on, watch where you're stepping. This is an anthropological site now. No place for tourists and hikers.\n\nAlthough, you have the look of an explorer about you. If you're with one of the expeditions, I suppose you could stay and observe.
Welcome to Seekhat Yol, ojel! See what the Hist provides.
You know, the Khajiit will do anything for a bit of gold. And I mean anything. It's never been so easy to recruit new test subjects!
I was first sent to Elsweyr to help fight the Knahaten Flu. At the height of that tragedy, we mages were regarded as saviors. Still are, actually.
This one's guild is nice, yes? But if another one would make a better offer of employment …. Well, that would be that.
Heading to the Abode of Ignominy? Then I'd advise some stronger armor. The dead swarm around that place like hungry skeevers, and your flesh is ripe cheese.
The Khajiit are the cleverest thieves in all of Tamriel, make no mistake. As well as the finest fences, of course.
Blood sport. Hmph. Frankly, I find the whole business repugnant. But then again, gold is gold, yes?\n\nPlease, cerum, feel free to browse.
You've underestimated me for the last time!
Simple ones. It's the Dragons you should be fighting.
Time for a well-deserved nap.
Shoo! Shoo, shoo!
No-one defies her!
Never have I met a race more proud of their unscrupulous ways than the Khajiit. It's as if they've found a sense of honor in being so damned dishonorable.
Over there! The queen wants them alive!
So much trouble, these Dragons. So much death around them.\n\nIf you want to help stop them from killing others, please check with me each day. I'm organizing Dragon hunts.
Euraxia has been defeated, but the Dragons remain. This one fears that our fighting may continue for many generations to come.
Spread out! The lightning is drawn to you!
Justice-AltF/B/Dragon
Justice-AltF/C/Necro
Gah! You contaminate us all, necromancer!
Justice-AltM/H/Necro
Belly to the mud, friend. A Dragon is near!
Only a fool meddles with the dead, dryskin.
Justice-ArgM/C/Dragon
Go back to your cave, creature!
Please, creature, just leave me alone!
Justice-DunM/D/Dragon
Kill it! Kill it! Before it eats someone!
Haven't we got enough problems without you provoking the dead?
Justice-KhaF/C/Necro
Justice-KhaM/F/Necro
Don't just stand there! There's a Dragon overhead!
Justice-NorF/D/Dragon
Shor's ghost! It's a necromancer!
You leave the dead be, necromancer!
Justice-OrcF/G/Dragon
Mauloch's fang! That's a ... that's a Dragon!
Tava, give me speed! A Dragon approaches!
Justice-RedF/H/Dragon
A beast such as you cannot be here.
Justice-RedM/D/Dragon
Do not wander too far from the village, rhook. This one has seen frightening shadows from the path to the Wall of Life. Spiders, as big as he.\n\nSurely the light plays tricks.
You're off to South Guard? Don't expect a warm welcome. The Black Gulls dug into that place like hoarvors—sucking the blood out of anyone who strays too close.\n\nShame. I hear it used to be beautiful.
The blight has you! Cleanse it quickly!
My dear priestess, I am not finished with you.
Go on and cradle your progeny! They grow up so fast.
What have you done? I've lost control of Selene!
You can't corner me.
You're owed that much.
Offer the Devourer their blood!
I've skinned many a Dragon. A cat will not be trouble.
Death to Azurah's litter.
Sure, the Dragonguard needs warriors. But what is a warrior without a good meal to strengthen their bones?
This one once had a life filled with forging horseshoes and bargaining with farmers. Now she can create weapons for the Dragonguard, the greatest adventurers Tamriel has ever known!\n\nQuite the improvement, wouldn't you say?
Most of these Khajiit would make better rugs than crew.
Stay out of the stock, unless you want to wind up like those other sap lickers.
Knew you were coming! Knew you were all coming for me!
You deal with the Dragon, I'll take care of the aegis!
I'm not sure what happened exactly, but Karthwatch was destroyed.
This should keep you busy.
Slaughter them!
The one who hired us? I hear even Kjalnar's scared of him!
Way I hear it, they buried something else down here. Something big.
Why wait, little fish? Come, face the shark.
Gragh na … pathetic.
Rest easy. I will put your corpses to good use.
Hah! You are rightly awed! Marvel at my creation!
Sing the void. Pull it out. Arrive.
Orkey's an interesting fellow, really, when you get to know him. We shouldn't hold a grudge about that mortality situation.
You're real, right? I'm not seeing things?\n\nOh, pardon, never mind. Strange and unsettling dreams plague me of late. The ones that leave you drained of all energy in the morning and questioning reality. I'll be fine soon, I'm sure.
Aren't the new bloodfiends adorable?
Has Sister Balra perfected the ritual yet?
You call yourself a warrior?
Those new to Solitude might find people here unwelcoming. My advice: listen and watch. And stop by if you start feeling isolated. You won't be the first to do so.
Move away. In fact, flee. Your kind is not welcome.
Pardon me.
Your facade hides something monstrous! Monstrous!
Go away! Or else!
I don't know what you are, and I don't want to find out.
You'll leave this place, or you'll taste my steel!
A beast such as you cannot be here.
Feh. Nords. Makes me sick to share blood with these weaklings.
A roaring fire sounds nice right now.
It's not so bad being a soldier. Regular meals. Not many responsibilities. But you've got to take orders. Go where you're told. Fight when you're told.\n\nDon't tell my captain, but part of me wants to wander and live off the land.
I never pictured myself in a place like this, but here I am!\n\nThere's a lot of work to be done, but I'm no stranger to hard labor. I did not come down here just for a purse full of coins.  Well … not entirely.
Welcome to Dusktown, stranger! You're new here too, right?\n\nAs for me, I'm not here to mine or uncover whatever trinkets are buried out there. I'm setting up a simple shop for the laborers to pick up goods they might need.
Ach! If you know anyone that needs a reliable place to sleep, send 'em my way. Might be on the floor, but safe is safe.
Keep a few alive. Captain has plans for them.
Continue the offerings!
Thank you … you saved my life.
This one is glad that is over.
The beast breathes no more.
Summon the bloodknights
You had little hope before. Now, you are truly lost.
We need more catgut for our bows.
Rise up and grind them to dust!
Deal with this problem and you will be rewarded. The vaults of Markarth are full and we have gold to spare. The Stonehands pay their debts.
Looks like he had quite the set up down here.
Ho ho! That second dose was a good idea!
They locked up a new batch in the basement yesterday.
Oh, I am so disorganized! I could use an assistant to help me catalog all my books and letters.\n\nAny chance you're avail—no, no, forget I mentioned it.
Ah, perhaps this shall please my lord.
Good! That should slow the effects!
Markarth takes some getting used to. My family came through by way of Cyrodiil during the Longhouse times. Glad I'm here and not in the middle of that war.
I love the exhaustion that comes when you've put in a hard day's work. \n\nEven better? Waking up the next day with that bone-deep ache.
Good work.
No! I must not fail!
Strike them down!
You completed the training? That's … wonderful. I'm still not qualified for most fieldwork. Oh, I have the requisite knowledge. It's the courage that's lacking.\n\nYou can measure my bravery with a small spoon and still have room for pudding.
Glory to the flame!
The Gray Host has finally been vanquished. Thanks to you. You are a remarkable individual, champion. All of Skyrim owes you a debt. I won't forget that.
Milksop this, milksop that. Turuk's claws are sharp, but his head is full of soggy bread.
Honestly, I thought this Ard Caddach wouldn't care if we went in and studied the Dwarven ruins here. But they wouldn't even let us into the first room!
This is no time to mourn your pet. The Gray Host demands your service.
Can you feel the power humming through here?
You hear that? No. Wait. What's that?
I guess it's your time!
Join me in glorious battle!
Aha! Battle is joined!
Do you trust your eyes?
I can't believe the boss banished Freyleth to the Deep Tombs.
I don't get why we don't slaughter those Ravenwatch sympathizers. No, no, I'm not questioning our leader.
It seems he mocks your feeble blows.
What to take first? An arm? An eye?
I still need more souls to summon the soul trap! Keep at it!
[Goblin happily babbling about his pet bear]
You there! I challenge you!
I'm back. Where to now?
All these slaves and yet no one brings us our meals.
Take a look at this new glyph I discovered.
Caught you!
Be careful out there, friend. More than one adventurer has underestimated the dangers of Blackwood.
I think you really angered the brute.
Try to dodge these, guar kissers!
I know my way around a weapon both by craft and by battle. Trust me, you won't find better anywhere in Blackwood.
Oh, sera. You look depressed! You know what always makes me feel better? Reckless spending!
Well done!
You broke loose!
Looks like the ruin just sunk into the ground here.
Stay alert. The master demands it.
A recruit who doesn't ask questions is a recruit who doesn't need answers. Do these socialites know anything about our doctrines?
Argonians? Wood elves? Assassins? Is there no end to this rabble?
Be ready to dodge out of the way if you're heading into battle! Gear up, too. I can help with the latter.
What do you think you're doing here?
The high priest wants them found!
I want to break mortal bones and rend mortal flesh!
Guard these halls with your very existence.
I don't trust anything made by Elves. Especially Wild Elves.
Blackwood has some lovely poisons, if you know where to look.
Mortals have no place in the Deadlands.
You're better off not asking a lot of questions of the people around here. Just a bit of friendly advice. It might save you a few bruises … or fingers.
Well, that sounds ominous. Is something bothering you?
What constitutes as mead around here is a vile insult to all Nords. What do they do to their bees? Feed them moon sugar?
You'll occasionally find the camps of Daedric cultists out in the marsh. I tend to avoid them. I had a run-in with Sheogorath once, and that was more than enough for me.
Our tribe of late feels so divided. I hope we can come back together, but I've hoped that for a while now.
Until I met you my life was tedious and uneventful. But now I feel the inexplicable need to endanger myself. Isn't that strange?
Oh, hello there! What are you?
That device belonged to the master!
I came all the way to Leyawiin to compete. I know I didn't have to, but these local teams need to see the majesty of a Nord in action!
You dare interfere with our work?
Don't save your strength.
Dagon notice my prowess.
Give me your life or I'll take it.
Bahsei's plans draw us ever closer to the Lord of Blood and Flames.
You need to keep moving!
There's my little friend!
Here, let's combine strengths!
Talk about evenly matched!
Can never have enough of that.
Did I ever tell you I found a piece of that Ayleid whatchawhoozit lodged in the seat of my britches after we delivered it? Hope the client didn't need it.
Experience the thaumaturgical prowess of a master!
A thousand apologies.
Not now.
Can you feel it? The palpable dread?
Scintillating, isn't it?
You seem familiar. Have we met before, little mortal? Yes, I think we have.\n\nMust I be burdened with yet another torture in this despicable tower of lies?
Be careful about what you touch in here. \n\nThe Witchmothers aren't very forthcoming about their possessions. If you're not sure about something, I'd suggest leaving it alone.
I'm ready to face anything.
The Prior's Divine work gives me chills. Imagine, dethroning the feared Princes of Oblivion!
I'd rather be a bearer than a shaper, but I won't complain either way.
The Prior had entrusted us with this duty. Live up to his expectations.
M'aiq once believed that living in a single dwelling would lack variety. But now that he has seen this one, M'aiq thinks that perhaps he was wrong.
I could use a strong cup of tea. Maybe with a dash of Daggerfall brandy.\n\nOn second thought, I'm on holiday! Skip the tea. I'll just have the brandy.
You've always had a special place of loathing in my heart, Cyronin.
The Prior demands your death!
Please, no!
Why would you behave so recklessly? I insist that you remedy this.
Hold there, scum!
Choose your next actions carefully if you value your throat, mortal.
You have made yourself a personal inconvenience.
Ungrateful maggots! All of you!
This place stinks something awful. But there is … potential. Opportunities, of a sort.
The Unmaker seems hungry. Who do you think we should give it?
Soon destruction will reign!
What? I'm working here!
Skein Row belongs to the Invisible Web.
What do you think happens to us? After all the disasters, I mean?
There you are! Prepare to be unmade!
A Daedric merchant's wealth is not measured in gold, but in favors and debts. Property is a means to power—and power is all they desire.\n\nRemember this when you do business with them, or you will find yourself paddling upstream on trouble river.
You think you stand a chance?
Little mortal? Well, well, well. A new suite of possibilities just opened up in Coldharbour.
My parents taught me to sew from the time I was old enough to thread a needle. Whether you're out on the sea or exploring the wilds, you'll want my fine stitchwork. Trust me.
Gloves off then, if that's how you want it.
You only prolong your suffering!
We'll bloody our teeth together!
Is this a spawning ground for those things? They just keep coming!
The Order will free us from all this nonsense.
I'll send you to the abyss!
Gut'em for the adders!
Feeling brave, are we?
One day we will ascend to stand at the master's side.
My will is not my own.
Death to enemies of the spire!
Our guardian hides its red heart ….
Don't drift off.
We've both got places to be, I'm sure. So, shuffle those cards and get on with it.
A pleasure to meet you. This one is called Nadari-dra. Rarely has she found herself in such a gathering of wealth. But then Nadari-dra's business ventures in the Systres are proving most profitable.
Do you hear that? That is the song of Y'ffre. He thanks us.
I said discreetly.
A day of hard work makes me very happy! Nothing beats a job well done!
Care to join me? I could use a partner.
I worry for the people of Gonfalon Bay. Too often are they captivated by the druids' woodland religion, charmed by its purported freedom. But Y'ffre pales before the true Divines.
So many dead things to choose from!
Always liked High Isle. Maybe I'll stay this time.
None have bested us!
Help? I don't feel so good.
You don't look so good!
We're fine. I don't really like getting into the sentimental stuff, so let's just leave it at that.
Ember the Sorcerer, reporting for duty!
I probably would have done the same thing.
I used to play games like these all the time. It's a great way to pass time, and maybe make some coin.
Nothing sweeter than the smell of treasure!
For Stendarr!
Ahh. Thanks for that!
This Magus character threatens the heart of my homeland. Honor demands we stop him.
Nope! I know it's just an illusion, but I don't like it, I don't want it. Uh uh.
I'm so glad we met the day of the tourney. And I very much hope you feel the same way.
I'm at your service.
Took that one in the tusks.
B'vek ….
Ha! That's just what I needed!
Good playing. Winner buys the loser a drink, right?
Rarely catch anything up here, but I love the watch the ships come in.
How sad. Rigurt's sack of Nord gifts is empty. I must return to Windhelm and fill it with all sorts of wonderments. \n\nSoon. After dinner. Or breakfast.
Voices and hooves. Fight. Fight!
Fishing here would be great if not for the ornaugs. And mountain rumbles. And pirates. And … why do I bother?
I need better ink than this watered-down shimmery nonsense from that merchant-thief. Yes, it's pretty, but I can't see it at night! Probably made from ornaug piss.
No sun can reach you in the deep.
Archdruid Michiel will claim glory for the Firesong.
Those from the mainland are a plague.
It would be wise for the nobility to stay out of our way.
Too long have we waited. No more.
Ah, yours is a comfortingly familiar face. Galen could use your help again if you're available.
Now that the chaos has subsided, a dear friend of mine proposed. To me. Seems my next wedding gown order will be my own.
The children that play in the market trust Arzalaya so this one made sure to protect them when the fighting started.
Trying to play hero? Not with our catch you're not!
The Dream of Kasorayn will come to pass.
Keep your scales wet and no one will hear you coming.
These are some dark days, aren't they? \n\nOr maybe it's just dark in here. I should go outside.
Admirable!
Greetings, my friend! Are you ready? There could be outstanding rewards in here, let's see!
I was so near when it happened. I didn't run. Great pieces of the cathedral fell into the water, and the waves lapped at my feet, and I could do nothing but watch.
I came to study how the Stonelore and Eldertide coexist. Never expected the Eldertide to be so offended by my presence though.
All those people in the cathedral … I just can't believe it.
I'm lucky to be alive after the Dreadsail attack. But how am I ever going to sort out these manifests now?
If you're looking to spar, I'm your man. It'll cost you a pint or two at the tavern though, I'm not about to get bruised for free.
I wonder how old this tree is. I've been trying to get an idea based on the size but even for Galen, this is a big one!
Up and at them, Gilded Blades!
Worms. Worms in the ground. They swim through the earth like fish. \n\nThey're everywhere. The lizards dance inside them.
<<1>> is wound too tight. He doesn't let anyone near his precious strongbox with keys to the pantry and storeroom, and he loses his crackers at the first sight of trouble.
Were you in town when the giant attacked?
Charge!
Smithing is an art, comrade. Sometimes you miss your mark. Happens to the best of us.
The stars bind this one! Their order is his prison!
Ogrim dung!
What, like a Nord bathing?
Could they have really …?
No, you don't! That's my leg, there!
I was worried about having the Dark Elves here, given what I heard about the Llodos plague. But they all seem healthy enough.
Give me a mace any day.
Please, get back up onto the path!
Too bad it's just the two of us. We could use more hands.
Stay out of each others' way! Don't panic!
How about another mug of mead?
Just walk away. Just walk away.
I drank a mug of beer big as my head! Amazing!
No, just no. Go find some cubs to fight first.
Have you tried the candied nectar bread? A High Elf gift to the people—and that is the truth.
Are you going to cry? I wish you would. You're pathetic!
No enemies in range, captain, but we're taking on water!
Ah! What is that?
What are you standing here for? Deal with the situation!
This one is lost. The kitchen. It is just through here?
We just need to get this last batch of sugar to the cave.
This is my hiding place. Find your own!
I feel better with these Covenant soldiers here. I hope they stick around for a while.
Why are the shipments from Mathiisen so slow? It is so near to Skywatch.
Of course! The natural quick wit and woodlands lore of the Bosmer will be welcome in our ranks.
Don't worry about the tests they gave you. We're starting fresh, with new training.
You'll not leave this tomb alive!
Bright moons keep you safe.
I'll just keep working. Mining. Digging. Mining. Digging. Best not to stop.
My blade will cut you so deep, it'll kill your whole family!
You must have been in that sea for a while.
Svalkmar is so angry. It's a good thing Sees-All-Colors is missing.
Watch your footing, Keep your ballance. One slip on the battlefield and you're good as dead.
Fire! Get water!
I hear rumors that all is not well with the Khajiit.
Satakal eats himself, and the spirits move to the Far Shores.
I could have sworn I heard something.
A moment of silence, for the departed.
As uncivilized backwaters go, you could do worse than Woodhearth. The treethane is respectable, at least.
He said if I didn't break the code, he'd kill my friends in front of me.
Don't you get tired of me constantly outdoing you?
Let us fight!
Y'ffre's beard, the bags those Northmen carry are heinous. They stink of old mammoth cheese and sour mead.\n\nI can guarantee you nothing I am intending to sell you will smell like this. You must simply trust me on that.
Even with its troubles, Summerset Isle is peaceful compared to what we've suffered here.\n\nIf you hunger or need rest, my home is yours.
We put the magic in magic-user!
You can look, but my equipment's only for battlefield warriors.
So this is life in cities free of the ash. The air is so clean here.
I have family working the mines near Gnisis. I wonder how things are back home?
We've been lied to!
Be cautious. Frost trolls await the unwary within the site.
Doing my job.
Tired of the old, boring troll fights? New management at Hadran's Caravan has pulled out all the stops!
Please—release me from this wretched body.
A sword of quality should be capable of shearing through your enemies' armor, as well as your enemies.\n\nIf it cannot do so then it's hardly quality, is it?
Satuhaz wagers, if one were to bring a pack of armored trolls to break into our vault, our trolls would be the victors in that scenario.\n\nWhy, you might ask? This one has the answer: Our trolls are vampires.
When studying magic, one must simply accept that certain factors of magicka will elude one perpetually.\n\nFortunately, for those times there are individuals like myself—willing and able to guide others toward understanding.
This one wonders … are they building our embassy in our style of construction but of stone? It would be perhaps cold, yes.
I don't have anything for you to take. Please don't hurt me.
I wish I could fight. If I could, I'd clear the trash out of the Middens. All the trash that people let pile up in here.\n\nYou know the type. Trash that fights back.
My babies are starving! Please!
<Person gasps loudly.>
Must be careful. Don't want to harm them.
If Sabibi were to climb the inside of this tree, do you suppose the Bosmer would take issue? It is just a climb, after all. This one merely wishes to have a better look at the apex of this chamber, where the tree meets the tree.
Is this the tallest tree in all of Tamriel? Probably all of Nirn, come to think of it.
One of my favourite things about Grahtwood is the way the stars look through the tree canopy. It really is quite lovely.\n\nBut I'm letting myself grow distracted! How may I help you?
I used to love the weather around here, but now I just find it very gloomy.
Surely, there is a way.
You're going the wrong way.
Do you often root through stranger's belongings?
Hungry, eh? I know the feeling. Mushrooms and bugs may be enough for these Dark Elves, but a Nord needs meat!
You said we'd be safe! This is not safe!
Frozen sands await you!
Did you figure that out for yourself?
The magistrate has no honor.
We'll eat well tonight.
My nan always said that a starving bear will eat itself. \n\nI say it's better to eat someone else. Am I right?
You wandered into the wrong ruin, friends.
Use this one's enchanting table as you see fit. The moons know the Orcs seem to have little interest in it.
Soft, little Bretons! All they do is moan and complain about the cold.\n\nHa! They should come to the Pale in springtime. And don't get me started about our winters!
I plan to head north during the thaw and trade for echatere meat with the Shatul clan.
The Orcs need tools to dig out all this stone, and Ak'saz is just the one to provide them!
How do I get out of here?
One death at a time!
The Abomination doesn't know his own strength!
Perhaps you can talk some sense into that stubborn ass, Pollius. He certainly won't listen to me, a mere citizen. We need to take this fight to the streets!
Anxious to get back in the fight, eh? Best to let these traitors sweat for a while. Let them think long and hard about their treachery before we slaughter them.
Once it's over, the Daedra will leave, and the city will be ours.
Dig in the ground and you'll find even more of these vermin.
An anchor broken from its mooring? Reinforce the heart of the device and launch another anchor!
You are a criminal. You owe a bounty. Pay me and perhaps your deplorable condition will improve.
I did not want it to come to this!
I'm not a judge or a jury. I'm just here to collect your bounty.
Now I'm angry!
Another bounty paid in quick fashion.
Wouldn't it be great to just start over with a clean slate? All you have to do is give up the gold.
In accordance with the law, your bounty has been paid.
You're not going anywhere!
Brave! Stupid, but brave.
You defied the law for the last time!
Bounty? Sure, we can call it that.
You're dead!
Worthless scum.
My feet hurt, villain. Pay and be about your business.
I love dealing with the criminal element. Will you pay your bounty and clear your record?
I hope you fight better than you smell.
Wrong answer!
Remit the bounty for your transgressions immediately.
I heard a commotion coming from the Arena District. I might just have to sneak over there and see what's going on.
Get out of here, fleabag!
Just stay away from me.
A criminal! Someone, do something!
I saw blood, save us.
I promise I won't say a word.
You must clear your name with the guards first.
I'll tell the guards I didn't see it.
Crime in progress, call a guard!
It's no use. You'll never get away with that.
I didn't see anything. Nothing at all.
You aren't very good at this, are you?
Stop what you're doing. Now.
I'd run if I were you.
I require aid.
Werewolf. A monstrous sight.
Please stop.
Someone stop that killer.
The tree knows when the leaves are disturbed.
The peaceful pond harms no one.
I can't shake the feeling I've misplaced something.
I don't believe it, a werewolf.
You're a bit heavy-handed for that.
Stop that. Now.
You waver from the path of lawfulness.
I'm not talking because I like the sound of my voice. Leave.
Pay your bounty and then come back to see me.
I don't believe it, a vampire.
My scales dry to see what you are doing.
Ahem. Thanks, but no thanks.
Go rob someone else.
Best not linger where you don't belong.
Make yourself scarce. If the captain finds out I let you go--
That was an ugly thing to do. You'll pay.
A killer--someone call the guard!
Guard, there's a fight!
Think you're really clever, eh?
Y'ffre's bones--a werewolf!
Don't even think about it.
Heh. Nice work.
Just go. I won't stop you.
You just go wherever you please, don't you?
There's a killer on the loose!
Y'ffre's luxuriant beard! What do you think you're doing?
A vampire! Guards, kill it!
Guards, a little help over here.
Don't worry, I have trouble remembering my own name.
They just attacked an innocent person!
I would prefer if you put your hand in your own pocket.
It's lost, oh gods, it's lost!
Keep those hands to yourself, you rogue.
Leave me alone!
Get your hand out of my pocket.
Mara help me! A werewolf!
I didn't see a thing. Nothing at all.
I saw who started it. Guard!
I suppose I'll have to tell the Guard.
Try to cut my purse will you?
Arkay's beard--a vampire!
Help! Please, someone!
No problem. Mistakes happen.
I don't want to die!
Get away, you sticky-fingered miscreant!
Please, I prefer my blood stay inside my body.
Those claws, how terrifying.
Calm the guards. We can talk after.
Pickpockets are parasites!
Has anyone seen my property?
Guards! There's been a murder!
Vivec condemns you. As does the law!
I'm not part of this. I mind my own business.
Vivec save us. A vampire!
You're not welcome. Nothing personal.
Dumac take you, thief!
Are you sick …? Oh no, a vampire!
I'm not part of this. I mind my own business.
Justice knows no sleep. You will pay for what you've done.
This one saw a murder!
Pay your bounty, then we can talk.
This one thinks you are acting very suspicious.
We have a no-good sneak-thief on our paws.
I have no problem with you.
What do you think you're doing?
By the Dark Moons, you'll pay for that.
This one requires aid.
I think the guard wants to talk to you first.
Guards! Stop that criminal.
Get out. You don't want what comes next.
Who would commit such an awful crime?
The guard is looking for you.
Stop that, you bloodthirsty skeever.
Guards, I spotted a thieving milk-drinker.
I like a criminal with a large bounty.
It's none of my business, I know ….
How would you like it if I stole from you?
Just leave me out of this.
You want to commit a crime, that's none of my concern.
I should put you down, you dog.
Please, I don't want to be involved.
There is no bottom to the wickedness of some.
By the horn of Stuhn, you'll pay for that.
Go away and I won't say a word.
I'll tell the guards what you did.
You have no business being there.
I have to ask you to leave.
We got a howler! Guards!
Guards! There's a killer on the loose.
I didn't see anything, I swear!
Go ahead. I dare you.
You'll sing a different tune when the Guard arrives.
You'll have to try harder if you want to steal from me!
You're drawing too much attention from the guards.
I don't deal with criminals.
Perhaps, now that you're in the clear, we could maybe get together …?
I'm tracking every move you make.
Warn the guards!
Just stay back, all right?
This is a private location.
I wonder how long it'll take the Guard to respond to my call?
You can't hide from justice.
You would be wise to engage in another activity.
Guards! Where are you?
Go away.
I have larger concerns than the fate of a criminal.
Leave me alone. I've done nothing to you.
I must have misplaced it.
I fail to see how your actions affect me in any way.
If that's what you want, I think it's an excellent idea.
I have larger concerns than the fate of a criminal.
Leave me alone. I've done nothing to you.
I fail to see how your actions affect me in any way.
If that's what you want, I think it's an excellent idea.
You are making a fool of yourself.
Try that again and I'll cut you.
Must be a hole in my pocket.
You're not leaving? This should be fun.
Sound the alarm!
That does not belong to you.
Why do I keep losing things?
Damn the war. Good for business, bad for everything else.
Where else can you get rid of ill-gotten goods around here? Nowhere! So let's deal.
Is there something I can do for you, Enforcer?
You'd drink too, if you had to put up with all these Enforcers.
Wouldn't I like to bash a few criminals over the skull, like you do. Must be nice, emptying their pockets.
All those criminals you kill … it must weigh on you Enforcers.\n\nI, uh, I didn't mean anything by that. Do you have any contraband?
You look like you've picked up more than one Dark Den Remembrance Pillow in your day. I'm sure I recognize you. I never forget a face—especially one as attractive as yours.\n\nHave we shared a moment or two. If not … well, we could start now.
It takes a deft hand to read magical clues left behind by evildoers, but I've been studying the aftermath of magical events my whole life.
Bal take you, backstabber.
Please, Yisraza, just go away!
I should never have come to this miserable place. So cold, so cold ….
This architecture is astounding. A mix of old and new—and some of it truly inspired!
Another customer? I can barely keep up!\n\nWhat can I do for you?
Don't let that happen again!
Bend, slave! Grant me your strength!
This one grew accustomed to the stench. Imperial diets must have included beef. A lot of beef.
Enchanting is a far grander trade than smithing, don't you think? Please don't tell anyone I said that.
Mmm … those smells coming from <<1>>'s kitchen!
You shall fry in your own skin!
Mortals! So predictable!
Supplies are now reaching the city on a regular basis. Maybe now our basic city functions will get repaired.
Shouldn't have stocked that much armor. Busted the wagon on my way in. Care to lighten the load?
A fine night, to drink, or dance, or spend a tidy sum on only the very finest of things.
I'm sorry I was late, but a bat … made off … with the baby. How do you tell someone that? Hoo, I could go for some skooma!
We try to be … accommodating to our clientele.
Come any closer and I will break you.
Burn!
No questions, only gold and wares.
I am the chosen of Akatosh and you are nothing.
Calm down. We're here to help.
My first thought when I arrived in Anvil was, "the Fighters Guild can fix this city."\n\nNow? I think, "whose arse do I have to kiss to get a posting in a more civilized location?"
Ever since Anvil's new governor declared the Gold Coast to be a free and independent state, life has gotten progressively worse here in Kvatch. I really wish Count Carolus would just do something about that dreadful woman!
I'm not used to being ashore. All this stability makes me queasy.
Silencer! Well look at you! I figured Tanek or Mirabelle would achieve that rank first, but there's no denying you deserve it.\n\nJust don't expect me to bow or anything.
Damn it, Alexia. Where have you gotten off to?
Not so fast, sweetmeat!
That's finished here.
This one is happy that so many have fled Dragonstar. Azzaril has the whole mine to himself. Harder work, but a bigger share, yes?
Some friendly advice. In the Arena, keep your menders safe. If you take out your opponent's healer while protecting yours, you'll be one step closer to victory.\n\nHealers are useful that way.
Interlopers! Trespassers! Your lives are forfeit!
The Redorans are skeevers, every one of them! And I'll fight anyone who tries to tell me different!
A word of advice. If you ever decide to open a mystic shop, do it in a town that isn't exclusively the domain of grubby-handed miners.
Potion and poison, it all looks the same to me. Here's your fee.
Did you look at the book? A true dungeon delver would have gotten it right on the first try.
What kind of vines throb and bleed?
For the Hunt-Father!
The Forge is my heart!
Do not worry about Red Mountain. Vivec always protects us and our homes. Truly, your purchase will not be regretted.
Word of advice? If you don't want to be put to work, avoid Foreman Mevel. It's much more fun to fight inside the quarry than gather stone all day.
Sometimes I just want to chuck it all and return to Wrothgar. Then I remember how the stronghold Orcs treat their women and I say tusk that! I'll stay right here, if you please!
Take courage!
May victory be ours!
Have they given up?
Not much longer now!
Tales will be told of your deeds.
Your actions bring great honor!
Yes! We got the relic!
Snatch the relic back, quickly!
Pick up the relic, now!
We need to get that relic!
They dropped the relic!
By Ysgramor! The relic is ours!
We captured the relic!
Almalexia save us! They've taken the relic!
Try discharging that energy at the automatons!
Be careful. We need to get these right.
Wow! A sweet roll!
They're going to win!
It's not over yet! Keep at them!
Strike back before it's too late!
By Stendarr! The point is ours!
Ysgramor damn them! They've captured the point!
They have seized the point!
We've got the ball! Praise the Hist!
Defend that ball!
They've got the ball! The moons grow dark!
Get that ball! Go, go!
Temper me in fire! It makes no difference!
I wouldn't advise purchasing furniture without a home to put it in, but who am I to tell you how to live your life? Feel free to browse my wares.
Your flames will flicker and die.
Do you think the Wellspring will ever have another harvest? Without Lector Naril, how can they possibly grow more plants? Just thinking about it has made me a nervous wreck!
What could you possibly wish to speak of? I assure you, I have nothing worth talking about. Well, nothing that you would understand, in any case.
I grew up with tales of the Hist, but have I never seen it. It does not concern me, though. How can I regret the loss of that which I have never known?
I didn't travel all the way to this mechanical bemusement simply to see the sights. I have a mission to perform!\n\nIf you'll excuse me, I'm much too busy to talk to you.
Carved up like fat Nords!
I am designed to serve.
Sniveling Gascone. He can't hide from us.
Ah, you've come to the right place for fun and excitement! But you need to purchase a crate first.
By Sithis! The point has moved!
There goes the capture point!
By Vivec! The capture point's moved!
If you seek membership in the Fighters Guild, you are talking to the wrong cat! Go see the Hall Steward for all the particulars.
You'll laugh at us no more!
Feel my blessing! Let it spread!
My girl Holi is the sweetest little Wood Elf you ever did meet. Make sure to treat her with respect, you hear? I'll have no disrespect in my inn.
The work of our High Elven forge-masters is without peer. You, my friend, deserve nothing less.
And so your hunt has ended.
Nothing like a good pledge to get your blood pumping!
Finally, a chance to defeat this resistance, once and for all!
Some strange happenings going on at Cey-Tarn Keep, if my contacts are telling the truth. Grisly business.
Alinor is just full of pockets ripe for the picking. Need to offload some items?
Have you heard the news from Tor-Hame-Khard? Nasty folk seem to be making their home there. I'd suggest a purchase or two if you're planning to travel there.
She's summoning her shadow tendrils! Watch out!
Per laj nogh to!
My gryphon shall tear you asunder!
Why, I've seen twelve performances this week alone! Each one a masterpiece. Not surprising. Everyone in Summerset knows that Rellenthil is the place for plays.
Didn't I see you with the Divine Prosecution? How can I be of service?
We've collected all sorts of source material in order to best research these cursed relics. Poetry, journals, even plays.\n\nJust read the plaques on the display cases if you want to learn more.
Now that you've gained a reputation, why not show off a little? My furnishings can help you do just that.
Feast upon that one first, my pack!
If magic won't do, how about fang and claw?
I used to sell more local cuisine, until the dryskins started to kick up a fuss. They run from strangeness as the mouse runs from the serpent.
I'll strike you down!
Gather, my servants! Crush all who oppose me!
You cannot fathom Meridia's power.
My sister Famia needs more supplies for Cyrodilic Collections' operations in Murkmire. If you could spare the time, talk to Jee-Lar. He's coordinating the efforts to equip our next expedition.
I'm the lookout, see! Got to make sure none of them scaly guards get in.
Though the guards of Lilmoth are hired by the various merchants in town, I've still found them to be extremely vigilant in their duties.
You will never defeat us!
That xanmeer belongs to the Blackguards!
The mud dries on my scales while we sit around and do nothing!
Get out of my way, kuuda.
The teeba-enoo court is a popular destination for the neighboring tribes. Just don't ask me to explain the game. I wouldn't even know where to begin.
Don't mind me. I haven't got any attachments to this place. If you find anything of value. Just keep it.
We will never forget the sacrifice that Xukas made so that our new village can prosper. Always will he be remembered, and always will he be honored.
Have you come to watch the torchbugs too? You are welcome to join me as long as you like!
Plenty of customers have made their way to Predator Mesa to prove themselves as great warriors. \n\nThe ones that don't buy the good stuff don't come back.
Off you go, walker. Swiftly, now! Quick work brings quicker pay, yes?
The blue will cover the world.
Her power courses through me!
To the dungheap with Euraxia and her dock-tailed collaborators!\n\nWhen the revolution comes, we will remember who stood with the Mane, and who did not. Count on it.
Have you been to the Sugar Bowl? I simply can't recommend it enough. The food is delicious and the entertainment doubly so. \n\nI'd recommend speaking to Zadazi if you're up for a night you won't soon forget.
The other races allow pride to blind them when it comes to combat. They enter battles they cannot win, and refuse to retreat when all hope is lost.\n\nBut we Khajiit? We would rather live to see another day than die some heroic death.
New to Rimmen, are you? Well, allow me to explain the rules.\n\nThe Jovial Lambasters help this refuge run nice and smooth. And for such services, all we demand is a little respect. Preferably in the form of gold and portable jewelry, of course.
Riverhold offers a variety of fresh food from our many farms. You'll often find the herders of Anequina pass through the market. \n\nOf course, we'll never be as large or bustling as Rimmen.
There's only so much you can learn by dueling old man Vek-Drassi. If I'm ever to become a skilled warrior, I need to get out there!\n\nYou're a traveler, right? You get it. The only way I'm going to get stronger is by leaving this place behind.
I'll stoop to your level, but it won't save you.
And thus ends this session of the wisdom of Abnur Tharn. Call upon me again when you want to continue your education.
Kra, a Dragon! I must … report this!
You look as though you've prospered, walker. Do not forget to offer Rajhin his cut for your good fortune.
Die for Alkosh!
Justice-AltF/G/Dragon
Xuth! The dead return!
Justice-BosF/A/Necro
Back! Back, you horrid beast!
Shapeshifter! Blasphemer! Curse your kind!
Dragon! Dragon! Hide!
By Arkay's beard, you must stop casting that now!
Justice-BreM/H/Necro
Do you want restless dead? Because that's how you get them!
For all that's merciful, just don't conjure my late mother-in-law.
Don't kill me! Whatever you are!
Take that filth to the Ashlands, necromancer!
Dragon attack! Run for your lives!
Hircine take you, foul beast!
Justice-RedF/H/Dragon
Justice-RedM/E/Dragon
Do you not see the Dragon? Run, you fool! Run!
Get this trash out of my way!
The Khajiit aren't that fond of Argonians. That's what I always heard, though they've been kind enough to me since I left Black Marsh.
Though Dragons flame their foes away, some fight against them holding sway. With armor thick and weapons high, we should force them to say goodbye.
I spend more in Senchal than anywhere else. I'm not a big fan of the general, though. He doesn't appreciate my time-honored profession.
You should try looking somewhere else.
Grr! That burns me up! Your turn.
You going to make me wait?
You'll follow Renald to your death!
Slaughter these cattle!
Join us in the azure world!
No more hunts today, walker. More's the pity.\n\nMany of these beasts remain alive. Too many. We resume the fight tomorrow.
Tusk them up, Iron Orcs!
Sure, I skim a little off the top. But you'd better keep that to yourself!
Just let those slaves try to escape. This one could use the target practice.
Come on! Someone sing us a tune! Too damned quiet around here.
The only joy greater than stories is sharing those tales with others.\n\nThis one has gathered many tales while traveling the breadth of Elsweyr. Perhaps you would like to hear a story about Khunzar-ri?
Come and accept death, mortals!
Ra'khajin revealed the path. Now we must walk it.
This one shall know the New Moons' secrets! He must know!
Tried a nip of the last batch. It'll take the wind out of your sails.
I fear no Dragons, for the Dragons are my allies ….
We shall tear the old Pellitine apart, stone by stone.
Even in death, there is no escape!
Go fetch, mongrels!
Drive them back to the sea!
You better not have stolen my blanket. I already warned you once.
Rip them to shreds!
Lonely? I'll gather some friends!
Might want to wait a moment between drinking those. They react poorly.
Simpletons! Can't you tell this is futile? I am invincible!
I hope you didn't come from the Eastern kingdoms of the Nords. If you did, you might consider keeping that to yourself. To say the Nords of Solitude disdain Jorunn is an understatement.
They call that a storm?
How many more tombs like this you figure we'll find in Blackreach?
The guards are looking for you.
Just-just stay back!
I'll stuff you full of arrows, you horrid beast!
I don't like the looks of you.
That thing's so ugly it's criminal!
Not interested.
I've got better things to do.
Mess with me, and I'll skin your hide to make a coat!
I won't tell a soul. Please, just go!
You will do well in my machine.
Pit Daemons are doing well, but then they've always been great on defense. I'd like to see the offense pick it up a little.\n\nThey're still the best, though. Dollinith doesn't know what she's talking about.
I'm tired of living down here. I feel like I can't breathe.
It'll be harrowstorms as far as the eye can see soon.
Sometimes I like to lick the blood off my blades.
Thought no one would find them in this wasteland. Thought wrong. Heh.
We must not let defeat halt our plans.
I'm talking to you, milk drinker! Fight me!
Working with these fools is impossible!
Sharing, yes?
My savior. Thank you for your help.
A second one? You will suffer the same fate.
This one will die like the first.
Come to me morsel!
What inferior taste!
Wither!
Whatever he's doing is getting to me! Shut him up!
I can produce this counter agent all day!
Something about Argonian blood tastes off to me.
Your death shall not be quiet!
You dare! You will reap what you've sewn here today!
Did you know that the Stranglehollow clan, now deceased, used to toast each other with a drink mixed using the fingerbone of an ancestor?
I can't abide people who fill their days with a sour temper. Like burrs, their manners catch on to all in their path. Bad for business, that is.
These hills make the craggy paths of Wrothgar look like an Imperial rose garden. You'll need what I'm selling to survive. Believe me.
Sometimes when you work yourself into a sweat, you just need to pause and breathe.\n\nIn those moments, savor your life.
Dark Heart, why do you remain silent?
Khajiit beverages are among the finest in the land. You will find nothing more satisfying than a glass of plum brandy or a snifter of Dark Moons spiced whiskey.\n\nUnless you are a vampire like Adusa. Then nothing tastes better than fresh blood.
I say we regroup and attack again!
I don't see why we can't have a little sport before we plant them. Right?
This land … I can't believe we need something in this place.
For blood and glory!
I've never been more grateful to be numb to the cold.
[proud Goblin declaring strength]
Reachmen aren't so different from Orcs. Gotta fight for everything we have.
The peace of destruction.
It's not over! Just need to stay strong!
To be honest, I prefer whittling keepsakes and furnishings. But weapons of war have a certain beauty too, I suppose.\n\nCome, show me your passion!
<Rapid Angry snorts>
Anxious to weigh anchor and find solace for a broken heart out on the open sea? I know I am!\n\nWhere to, my friend?
Well done! Now faster!
I'm not trying to be a bother, but I could really use some assistance here!
Your frailty betrays you, mortal.
Yes, more, more!
Why does Lalais insist we guard every chamber? Is she expecting unwelcome guests?
The lord of bloodshed will rule over all existence!
Foolish birds, they take Her love for granted.
Are you lost?
Can you feel it? The roots cling to your scales.
As Lord Dagon commands, so shall it be!
Can you believe that some Nibenese make a hobby out of arranging marriages? You heard me correctly. A hobby, not a paid profession.\n\nThe only thing worse is planning weddings! Who would volunteer for that?
Fine, I will kill them myself!
New strategy, eh?
I keep finding burnt fish in the waters around here. It's very odd. Either someone's playing an elaborate joke on me, or there's something very wrong going on in Gideon.
Sometimes, at night, the glow of the stars here shifts slightly. Or perhaps that's just my sorrow at the plight of our people.
Life was made for good friends and great adventures.
I hope you're not offended. Physical relationships aren't something I take lightly.
Keep them on the defensive!
I will cut out your heart and eat it raw!
A merchant recently visited, seeking unusual items to purchase. I offered her some water. She looked confused.\n\nI told her the water here is unusual to those who live elsewhere. I don't think she took me seriously after that.
Something's wrong. I shouldn't be here.
The Hist sent me out to spearfish in every puddle of water between Lilmoth and Leyawiin.\n\nI am unsure of the purpose of this, but I am attached to no outcome.
End this farce and I will take less pleasure in watching you burn.
I saw all the cultists I cared to in Deepscorn Hollow. Yet here we are, dealing with cultists again.
Look here! A stranger's loss might be our gain.
Careful, now. For a duelist, death can be a professional hazard.
You mess with the swordsman, you'll get the point!
Grandmother! You should be resting, not wandering about in the minds of others.
Help! I'm … help!
If you're planning to boss me around. Forget it. I'm neither your servant, nor your friend.
If you've got something on your mind, you can just come out with it.
As far as I'm concerned, all snakes are poisonous!
If you're trying to introduce me to your family, I have no interest in your siblings!
Dare I say, I think you're being a good influence on me.
I was telling the maids and fellow manservants the other day how much I appreciate the clear directions and stern punishments that Lady Laurent hands out. I would be lost without her guidance.
Is this the best Dagon can throw at us?
Enjoy your time off when you get it.
Asked her name and had to set Chrysanthemum to music. Never again.
Took my beloved to watch the sunset the other night. Highly recommend it.
Mortal blood to spill!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
How much more power must we lend you?
Well, what in Oblivion have we got here? Something for everyone!
I'd say it's coming down like cats and dogs, but it's not!
I still think about Martus's final moments. They hang over me. Affects me more than he deserved.\n\nHis death was justified, but sometimes I regret taking it upon myself to deliver it.
You dare attack the Silver Rose?
The slaves of Oblivion come for us!
Something's coming? Ack!
Think you can steal from me?
They'll have your hands for that.
Oho! Got good friends, eh?
Standing in front of these orbs is supposed to rid you of your aches.
Hold your tongue and don't complain. Laws do not change overnight.
Who can I sacrifice to Lord Dagon today?
Issata, are you quite finished yet?
Studying magic was not supposed to be impossible!
Come to look at the crystals?
No! I will not be bested. Not by you!
How? How are you so strong? How can you do this to me?
Fight bravely, mortal. It will be over soon.
You will burn!
Do not falter! Stand strong!
No!
The Lord of Devastation sends his regards!
Why do we sit here like blisters on an Ogrim's arse? Is there no realm nearby that we can hurl down into ruin?
I wonder if Mehrunes Dagon ever gambles. He strikes me as a sore loser, though. Probably hit me with a flood or an earthquake if I happened to beat him, right?
You choose to flee? Ha! You will find few comforts in the Deadlands.
I use only the finest fabrics, blessed by Stonelore druids. It can't hurt, right?
Help! Before they touch me with their … claws.
Did the others make it out all right?
Get a move on! I said get!
Don't sit next to the alchemist. Fumes, you know. Took the hair right off my head.\n\nNow, how can I help you?
This one needs another perch!
Let's see those Tribute cards, runt. I'll go easy on you, I promise.
We must bring more into the spire's service.
We serve the spire. As is right.
The coral will feed on your life!
The Order is my life. I don't know where I'd be without it.
The Tamsfolk must be taught respect. And fear.
Amenos Station may not be as grand and exciting as High Isle, but I like it here. There's plenty of work to keep my hands busy!
I miss the mountains. Even the volcano is barely the size of a hill back home.
I was only supposed to be here for a few days, but I'm not sure I want to leave. It's not the prettiest place I've ever been, or the nicest … but it does have a certain tranquility to it, doesn't it?
Someone had the audacity to suggest I read one of those … Investigator Vale stories the other day. The author surely has some talent, but I like to think I have more decorum than that. The few excerpts I've read are practically bawdy!
Please tell me you're the sailmaker's representative. And that you've got enough canvas to fill three masts in a wagon that's already on its way here.\n\nWe're behind, and I need those sails!
If you're going to be barging your way through the rest of Dreadsail Reef, I could use your assistance. I'll make it worth your while.
I had so much to live for … but not like this. I barely remember the sight of the sea.
Mutineers and traitors! You're all mutineers and traitors!
Try to keep moving!
Watch your magicka, that stuff's important!
Did I ever tell you about the time I accidentally filled Huldressa's room with snails? I don't remember what I was trying to do, but the end result was hilarious! Took her weeks to get the slime off the windows. Maybe she wasn't wrong about me.
Scores all around us, and only our valor to carry the day. What a tale!
Stendarr is with you. I can feel it.
I think Aurelia's finally learned her lesson. And we've cleared my family name, as best we can. Now we can focus on more important things: candied banana bread and exploring ancient ruins.
If I'm stuck here much longer, they're liable to forget about my bounty entirely.
You did it! Now, I'll close this fissure.
Not much point in worrying about the volcano. It's going to do what it's going to do. When it settles down, just rebuild somewhere else. That's how we do it in Vvardenfell, anyway.\n\nWhat do you need?
You wish to see my wares? Really? At a time like this?\n\nI know some people hope the volcano will just quiet down. They're carrying on as best they can until it does. But I wouldn't be here if I had anywhere else to go.
Rigurt loves this place! My eyes are round with wonderment! What fine examples of cultural bric-a-brac! Rigurt is hugely impressed!
My bestest friend! No one knows the depths of Rigurt's heart like you. What? \n\nNo, Rigurt needs no help right now. Can't one friend express affection for another? I will most likely need help later. Rigurt will let you know.
You won't make it out of this!
Look, Laurel. Your last hope dies at my feet.
Healer Roslenn insists this treatment will work.
Let the one who stole my steel pay the Blood Price.
I understand that you have obligations to your friends in the Dark Brotherhood. If I might ask a favor? \n\nAllow me to step away when you're engaged in such activities. My honor makes it hard to reconcile our friendship and your actions.
I can't take your gold. My reasons are my own. Please, move along.
No one respects stable hands. It's backbreaking work. What would these streets look like without us?
Hey, it beats playing Tribute.
Mind your coin. You wouldn't be the first visitor to have their purse stolen as they tour our docks.
Y'ffre knows only one thing will heal my wounds. Revenge.
No matter how many times Javolia explains it, I just can't get this spell right.
Thank you for your assistance. Now, make sure you enlist some assistance of your own. The creatures you will face will be most formidable.
I have room for you aboard my ship, but considering all that's happened, I'm sure it won't last long. \n\nWhat's our heading?
So what if some of my stock comes from shipwrecks? They're not planning on using it anytime soon.
I hope the Firesong can find a better outlet for their chaotic magics. I am certain there is good to be had from a second chance.
Careful where you leave your gear. The children around here like to make games of traveler's belongings.
Fire is mine to command!
She just smiled at me. Maybe I have a chance.
I don't think they went this way.
With the blood sacrifice made, the volcano spirit has been awakened.
Feel the power of my flame!
I thought the Dreadsails would kill us for certain. Then the other Sea Elf appeared out of nowhere and struck down the Dreadsails who took us prisoner.\n\nWhat is going on here?
Sometimes, I read books so miserable that they make me want to get up and walk into the sea! I wish I had someone to talk about them with.
I've lived in Vastyr all my life, and I've never seen anything like that collapse. Is it still safe here? I don't want to leave. I can't leave.
I've heard people saying Vastyr's such a gloomy city. I say it's only as gloomy as we let it be!
Tall Papa will guide those we lost. Each star in the night sky will lead them … none will be lost.
Birds always get quieter when a beast is nearby. Always keep an eye on the forest line and an ear to the sky.
Oh, don't tell me. You're a hero who has come to save us from the destruction some villain or another plans to inflict on us all.\n\nI do mean it when I say don't tell me.
Little enough is known of Vaermina, yet scholars claim they know more than they do. Before you ask, no, I'm not a Vaermina cultist, but I do pay attention to what sleep brings me, as should you.\n\nAnd now, I'll pay attention to what you bring me.
I'll take just about anything and secure it away from the law and the lawless alike. But not for righteous arses. Don't be a righteous arse, and we're good.
I don't like this. Where did the Firesong come from?
Blood in the water. The sharks feast today!
I can't eat any more seeds and scraps. Last time I did I broke a tooth on a pebble. What I wouldn't do for some warm bread!
I can feel the spores on my fingertips. Can't wipe them off. Have to cut them off.\n\nSomeone give me a knife. Please!
You think Naldyn's murder is what they mean by "Blood for the Pact?"
How dare you defy the Order of the Black Worm, slave!
Farvild, some of us are trying to think!
Where's the captain? And the first mate?
It's an honor to carry such a weapon.
No more dereliction of duty!
I'm getting out of here!
No Wood Orcs sighted within town!
What is the average flight velocity of a sparrow?
The disappearances have put everyone on edge.
It's not Camlorn, but it's not so bad here.
I surrender! Please, just let me go!
What you are up to now? Trouble, yes?
Would you like to hear something a little bawdy?
Thank you for rescuing me. They killed so many people…
Intolerable! The servants are afraid to go out after dark!
If I wasn't so drunk already, this would probably hurt a whole lot more.
Well, I'm not so sure.
I've got half a mind to take one of these Red Rooks and—oh, who am I kidding? I'm not a fighter.
You can do better than that!
You don't look like a Worm Cultist, so welcome to Riften.
Bring them before her!
Listen. Listen. Hear that?
The Skeevers are going to make a nice meal out of you.
More fodder for the lions.
No! I won't give in!
What's the constable doing? I know people on that ship!
Take him to the warehouse! Give him to the slavers!
You're not like us … but you are at the same time. What are you doing here?
Please, I don't … ? Oh. You're not one of them?
Don't let me die in here!
Huzzah!
That's worth considering.
Think I'm not looking? Think again.
Wine, please. I need a pleasant scent under my nose.
Everyone's dead … everyone.
You think you stand a chance against my men?
May your road stretch, sun blessed, before you.
I hate that Shagrod. Damn his soul to Oblivion!
If you have legitimate business on these premises, talk to the banker.
Don't be shy! You want what we're offering, don't you? Then talk to Huthak about the secret ingredient that makes his brews so devastating!
Stay out, pal!
I'll slit you from ear to ear and bathe in your blood!
Eh.
S'rendarr's mercy, <<1>>! Where is your son?
Much like our home of Cyrodiil is the heart of Tamriel, so now do we have Eyevea. The heart of the Guild.
One more flourish, <<1>> and I'll have you running the camp with <<2>>.
Kuna's Delve is doomed! Leave now!
We're never going to be ready if you keep taking breaks!
Good luck, dearie. I'll wait here. I'm too old to play with snakes.
You came a long way to die, stranger!
Pluck its eyes for staring brandy. A gift for the Madgod!
The Mother is merficul to her children, but against her enemies, her rage is boundless!
Only one remains!
I have heard that the fields of Cyrodiil are lush. What would they want this place for?
Contempible creature.
Oath of Ebonheart!
Both guilds ended up scattered all over Coldharbour. We lost some good people when that happened.
M'aiq wonders. Are the skeletons in minotaur graveyards half-Man or half-bull?
M'aiq wants nothing to do with Daedra. He hears they can make trees burn forever. How can they do that?
M'aiq thinks the maddest thing about the Vaults of Madness is their location.
Meddler! Interloper!
You're not going anywhere!
Burned and blasted. The most exquisite kind of corpse.
Why that strange High Elf is so eager to purchase red brittle is beyond me. But I'm sure you have more important business to discuss with me.
If you're Stone-Fish material, then I'm the king of Shornhelm. Move along and don't look back, sour tart!
Make yourself at home, then talk to Kerennia when you're ready to go to work.
Fall in a lake and die, you overgrown campfire!
….
Dagon's flame ignite!
You look like you traveled far to visit our fair city. Beautiful, isn't it?\n\nHow can I help you today?
Clan Shatul runs these stables now—it's a damn good thing, too. These locals can't tell a mare from a gelding!
Yes, over there is fine. I'll have it packed up before long.
Just kill me if you're going to. I've nothing left to live for.
You're a true hero, friend! This medicine's going to do a world of good. Trust me.
I cannot stay here!
This one sees spiders everywhere. Perhaps there is no escape.
This delightful new strain of hoarvor will fight on the front lines soon.
These soldiers cower here while their corrupted brothers and sisters walk the streets. It's insufferable.
Consume them. You must grow larger if you are to serve in the war.
Something is wrong with my eyes. Everything seems so blue.
Thought is weakness. Obedience is the true power.
They'll give them cast-off weapons, and make them kill each other.
Capture the strongest, slaughter the rest. Go!
The kyn does not deserve such treatment.
Don't wait for me. I'm just catching my breath here for a bit. You go on ahead.
Once this war is over, we'll rebuild our homes better than they were before!
Could I possibly convince you to do the right thing and pay your fine? Please?
Don't give me any trouble. If you pay your bounty, you'll walk free.
You aren't clever! The law found you and demands its due. Pay your fine or face the consequences.
You have a bounty to pay. Are you listening? Uh, I'll try to speak up.
The law says I have to stop you, but that's it. Just give me the money and you can keep walking.
The spirits of the mortals are easily maniplated.
Guards, help! A notorious criminal!
Bloody-minded fiend. Guard!
Do you always act like this?
The guards won't get anything out of me, I assure you.
Is that how your mother raised you?
Crime? What crime?
You can't just kill people like that.
Hist mother protect us from turmoil.
I am not your enemy.
I can't believe they just killed a person.
You really shouldn't be doing that.
I'll forget this if you'll let me.
I can't just stand by!
Z'en's Price! That'll get you a big bounty.
To strike someone down like that--you're a monster!
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Better not be planning anything stupid.
That's a bad idea if I ever saw one.
I can't believe you did that. Guard!
So what's the fine for a crime like that? I imagine it's huge.
Someone stop this gorbellied lout!
Get me out of here!
I'll not stand in your way. Not worth it.
You're a festering boil on the lip of society. Guard!
There was no need for that.
A crime in progress. Oh, whatever shall I do?
By Vivec, how awful!
I can't believe you just murdered that person.
I don't want to die.
By Vivec, how awful!
You'll pay, villain!
You're a murderer.
Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.
Murderers like you make this one's fur stand on end.
How could you do such a thing?
This one witnessed a murder.
Do what you like, I won't tell.
You think because I'm Khajiit I won't mind you stealing?
I wish someone would put a stop to these petty crimes.
Do not let that thief get away!
Stay away from me.
All crimes must be punished, no matter how small.
If you've seen one crime, you've seen them all.
Don't you touch me!
Here come the guards.
Leave me alone. Don't hurt me!
Trolls spit upon you, criminal!
By Ysmir's beard! There's a quite a bounty on that one.
What did I do to deserve this?
I saw nothing. Let me be!
Some criminals are really sneaky, but not you.
You can't do that. Not here!
Malacath's nethers!
Not a smart thing to do in public.
Mauloch's arse, I don't care what you did.
Knock it off, you thug!
Are you looking to make trouble?
Leave me be and you won't regret it.
Not so fast. Guards!
Hey! The lawbreaker's getting away!
Way to rattle the cages, comrade. Let us handle things for a while. These grunts need the exercise.\n\nFeel free to check in from time to time. We may need you again soon.
I think you have this well in hand, so I'll stand back and give you room to work!
I saw an Orc trying to repair a water wheel the other day, but no matter how hard he punched it, the darn thing refused to turn.
Please, when you're done using the tables, clean up after yourself.
Taking a pounding!
Some Dremora tied a severed hand to the dog's collar. I think it was its owner's.
Hardwood's tough to come by out here on the coast, but I've got plenty of other goods. What do you need?
Ah, it's the Dwarf-junk slayer! Good riddance, eh? What can I get you?
We may not act the part, but Orcs are natural mages. I've barely passed my first tests and I've already learned so much!
Yar gor garag!
I'll turn you to soot and cinders!
I don't care who takes over the guild, as long as they supply me with components and let me build things that go boom.\n\nI've been working on a mechanical bird with an explosive inside. Impractical? Probably. Dramatic and flashy? Most definitely!
Gold for a miserable wrack. No, that's wrong. Wreck? Wretch?\n\nOh I give up! Why do I even bother? I'm the worst beggar ever to walk the streets of Abah's Landing! Whatever shall I do?
Tomb robbers. There is no lower form of thief.
As the Iron Wheel turns, justice prevails.
"Herein lie the countless damned, their worth measured only by the weight of the gold that condemned them. Select your meal and devour it whole."
Watch where you step. I haven't finished mopping.
Xal-Nur make you spit blood!
Have you come to hear the will of our Night Mother?
Sow fear, Silencer.
Something you needed, Silencer?
There are plenty more jobs waiting, so finish your current contract.
Hoisting crab-pots isn't as glamorous as hoisting the black flag, but honestly, what is?
Don't even bother with that chapel! Nothing but faithless hypocrites in there.\n\nBack in my day, a silken shawl over a single breast was considered modest! Now? Feh. Wooden pews and sky-high collars. It's a disgrace!
Time for the main course!
Why that strange High Elf is so eager to purchase red brittle is beyond me. But I'm sure you have more important business to discuss with me.
I once spent five days drinking mead with Thane Jeggi at a fishing hole in Eastmarch. We had a fabulous time!\n\nBut never try to match Jeggi mead for mead. The man drinks like a thirsty mammoth!
Keep walking, you infidel dog! The Blood-Feathers care nothing for pleasantries—only for the banter delivered by the blades of our swords.
The Captain really thinks we can bring Imperial Law to this backwards region? That'll be the day! When pigs fly, I say.
My forge may sputter and spit like Red Mountain, but it gets the job done. Feel free to try it yourself, if you're so inclined.
You're an adventurer, aren't you? I knew it! What an exciting life you must lead. You absolutely need to tell me all about it. Are you free later? I can meet you after the shop closes for the day.
Hammer and steel! Now that the end of the world isn't quite so imminent, I'm busier than a bull-netch surrounded by a herd of excited betties!\n\nStill, if there's something you need, just speak up and I'll get to you in a moment.
Ah, the hero of the Dominion! I have something special I just know you can't do without!
A little fame can be dangerous, but at least we can do business.
Ah, the hero of the Pact graces my shop. This one is unworthy, but let me show you what I selected especially for your home.
Think you're tough? I've dealt with dozens that are tougher. It's my business to provide for people like you. So, are we ready to do business?
Something special for someone extraordinary? You've come to the right place, champion.
Select your crate and we can begin. Most crates contain four rewards, but sometimes you will get a special fifth reward!
You are today's top player, my friend! You should feel very fortunate!
<cough>
Should I offer him the land at a ridiculous price?
All these Telvanni mages can do is boast and brag. I'd bet hard gold that if they had to face off against one of our fellow Guild members ….\n\nSuffice it to say, there's more to the craft than mere bravado.
Who's safe from these Reach-dogs? Only Falkreath's walls, surely. We'll go there.
Oh, hello. We seem to be, ah, adrift.
Critical fault detected in sweep sequence. <<1>> proceed to restoration alcove for analysis.
The Master personally selected me for this mission.
Many depend on our services for travel. We're far more reliable than your typical caravan, that's for sure. Not many creatures wish to face off against a silt strider.\n\nWould you like to journey with us?
Heard about an egg-mine with singing kwama in it. They're so good the miners can't even work! They just keep clapping! Imagine that.\n\nDo you need something?
Nothing worse than sand in your armor. You would think Alik'r would have prepared me, but the surrounding wasteland here seems endless.
Currency and personal goods can be stored within our bank.
You're scared. We can feel it.
Direct hit! Slay the abomination!
Merchandise can be bought for currency!
Gentle night, show me your darkness.
Shall we try again?
The High Elves aren't so bad. At least, not most of them, anyway. I came to this land with the shirt on my back and a dream of running a profitable stable. Now I have two shirts and a busy stable.\n\nAm I profitable? Depends on you, I suppose.
Sleek and fragrant! This one drools at the sight of you, my dearest five-claw! Marakar knows a place where we can zuub-zuub until our tails fall off. Very secluded.\n\nBut business before pleasure, you understand. This pack matches your eyes .…
I saw an absolutely amazing rendition of the Bard of Black Marsh performed by the House of Reveries. It's not as grand as your High Elf operas, but I enjoyed it.\n\nChanging the subject, did you see who entered the palace today. Um, just curious.
My shield! How dare you fools make me drop it!
Insubstantial and insignificant.
What is that approaching? Some strange sea beast? Prepare to be boarded, mates!
Truthfully, at this point, you should just ignore most of what Master Rolis says. He's rather an odd duck.
Cloudrest has already fallen. And so too shall you.
As per my contract, I'm obliged to tell you about the wonderful items I have for sale.
You'll all burn beneath my flames!
You dare attack my mistress? Heathens!
Newcomers continue to enter the city in droves. How are we to keep track of them all?
I like this spot. The gentle babbling of a nearby waterfall, the shade of this beautiful tree. If you ever need a quiet moment, feel free to join me.
When allies enter your house, you want them to know of your great deeds in the Battlegrounds. These wares can help.
You've proven yourself on the Battlegrounds, and now it's time to remind others of your great deeds.
Most don't like to eat indriks. Say it feels unpure. Me though? I just see them as deer with a little bit of extra magic, is all.
Just the other day I saw a member of the Mages Guild take a trimming from one of my plants. The monster! The aesthetic value was tarnished, and for what? Alchemical experiments?
Looking for the best furnishings to show off your accomplishments? Well, you have certainly come to the right shop.
Still alive? Well, Vykosa simply must do something about that.
Tender flesh. Warm, delicious flesh. Oh, yes.
<High pitched whining.>
I'm in the business of heroes. Not training them or nothing, but rather rewarding them. The more deeds you accomplish, the more furniture will become available to you.
No, no!
You think you can trap me?
When you are remade, you will wonder why you resisted.
Supplicants, you will serve for all time.
Suppose I'll have to get used to seeing you around. Unless this work finally gets you, too.\n\nGot a job if you're willing.
When I was young, hatchlings emerged from their shells with a spear in one hand and a sword in the other. Now? Well, see for yourself.\n\nNot one of them will survive the Path.
The ritual is in danger!
We're ready to move against those weakling Bright-Throats.
Don't look now, but I think that dryskin is staring at your tail.
The Prowl's full of dangerous creatures if you're looking for big game. Me? I get my thrills on the open road.\n\nBut look at me, prattling on. How can I help you?
This blood-brew is potent. Trolls taste vile, but you will never feel more alive.
Dro'zakar will taste your blood before the Dragon's. He is always hungry.
You're boring me, mortals.
This was deserved.
The Dragons are endlessly fascinating, wouldn't you agree? How do they fly, given their prodigious size? How do they breathe fire? So many questions!
It's hammering time!
Sezdi's children ask her, "Why did we come here? What is there to find?"\n\nShe tells them, "Look at the ashes, the crumbling stone. Know once that this was a place of healing, of peace. And know how easily it was destroyed."
Soon, you will be nothing but a stain beneath my feet.
There's nothing here! We're just wasting our time.
You slump under the weight of all your goods and coin, yes? Barter with J'darji. He will lighten your load.
So says Abnur Tharn, overlord of Nibenay, Chancellor of the Elder Council, and battlemage extraordinaire.
I love talking to customers, but you're probably here to speak to the Impresario. She's right over there!
Ziss! As if a back-breaking workload weren't enough, this Dragon shows up?
Turn the elements against themselves!
Only those who survive a Dragon can later tell the tale! Thus, this one flees!
Ah, no, this one prefers not to tangle with surprise Dragons!
Justice-AltF/C/Necro
Trinimac defend us from such as you!
Abomination against Y'ffre! Leave my presence!
Justice-AltM/C/Dragon
I'll stuff you full of arrows, you horrid beast!
Please, someone save us! There's a Dragon coming!
My eyes aren't too good, but I could swear that's a Dragon. I'm right, right?
Not me! Take the n'wahs!
Necromancy! S'rendarr preserve us!
If you're looking for something to eat, I've got nothing for you!
Justice-NorM/B/Necro
You ever realize how big this inn is? The other day I found another level I didn't even know existed. But, oh, you probably want to buy something, yes?
This one may have a few things for you now, though you are yet young in your fame and feats.
I don't care to know where or how our clients get their gold or precious items. All I care about is making sure they remain locked up until the client needs them.
Red diamond, red diamond … dah dah dah dah …. Ugh! Sorry, just can't get that song out of my head!\n\nYou need something, right? How can I help?
Sometimes I just sweep the dust under a bench or table. No one notices because this place is so big and dusty all the time anyway. Soldiers and their dirty boots. The bane of my existence.
You almost had it! Maybe?
Draw your weapons. Make them bleed!
Whet your appetite, Devourer!
Don't hang about too long. Your target's certainly not going to.
And bring me some rum while you're out. I get bleary after a while and a tipple helps clear the fog.
That giant's going to break loose eventually. Just you wait.
Ziss'vo! Little is worse than unexpected Dragons.
Just a little longer! I'm nearly finished with the aegis!
You again? Get out of here before I call the guards.
Another day, another robbery.
I'll tear you apart and leave your pieces for the Giants.
Gaze into the abyss!
Spare a few for the laboratory!
I hope you fight well, blood is so much tastier when terrified.
I recommend everyone travel Tamriel for a few years. Otherwise, you become close-minded and isolated. I learned more in a month as a sailor than I have in a year in Solitude, and trust me, I've tried my best here.
You know, I've never been that far outside Solitude. Sounds like the rest of the world is falling apart. Why would I want to go out in that?
I'd avoid Morthal. They're solitary, rude, and think they know best. Try to tell them how to do something better, and they'll push back so hard your neck will ache from the whiplash.
You'll soon wish the storm had swept away your soul.
You shall not claim the gray reliquary. Oblivion will take you first!
I've heard some unsettling rumors, as if there are any other kind out here.
If you want to store goods within our safe —\n\nThat's it. I'm shaving my head. Why do people even grow hair here? The insects seem to seek it out! The biting is incessant! It's not just me, is it?
You seen one barrow, you seen'em all.
Hoo, don't take a whiff out of one of those jars.
I hear that some warriors learn to dance to help them with their battle training. Perhaps I should seek them out and leave this stall to my sister.
Seek not pies or cakes or lesser pastries! No, only the splendor of the sweetroll is worthy of your reverence.\n\nYou don't want nasty tummy aches, do you? Because too many of those lesser baked goods lead to them! The sweetroll does not!
Start herding the harrowed. They'll make for good foodstock.
The Pit Daemons' color scheme is just fabulous, isn't it? This shade of green is perfect for inspiring terror in our opponents. And scaring off any giants!\n\nMuch better than the pumpkin and eggplant colors of the other teams. Hear that, Dollinith?
We have the honor of being the first to break ground down here, that's not nothing.
This place is full of nightmares. We never should have come down here.
Rations are in short supply here. Some nights we eat nothing but watered broth and a hunk of bread for dinner. After a long day of work, it's a bit disheartening.\n\nStill, this is my duty. I'm not here for luxury.
It's a trying time for the Orcs of Mor Khazgur. The crisis in the mine is putting everyone on edge, and our leadership needs my services.\n\nOff with you now. I must return to my work.
What are they chanting?
Nobody beats Rolstag … always win.
How do we get out of here?
Kill anything that comes out of a portal!
How do you like that, you pale freak?
How pathetic!
It is dead, yes? Perhaps someone should check.
Let's make this one suffer.
Kill this fool!
You will not live to regret that.
I suppose I could use another break.
Ard Caddach is a generous host when he wants to be. Just mind that glint in his eye—means he's playing several games at once.
I hear that people outside the Reach fear our witches. I pity them deeply. Seems to me that being fearful and close-minded is no way to live.
Gwendis suggested we hire a bard to sing your song, five-claw. The hero of Western Skyrim and the Reach. The slayer of Rada al-Saran. Unless you are too modest to accept such praise?\n\nJust know Adusa appreciates your efforts. We all do.
I know. I'll recommend you as an Undaunted Trailblazer. That way, when you scurry away from a battle like a startled skeever, you can just call it scouting.
I don't like Caddach, I don't like Markarth. I don't even like the ale they serve at the inn.
This power belongs to the True-Sworn.
I'm coming to like it here in these old ruins. Stay here and reinforce the defenses, I say.
How I longed for this day. Soon all that we have given up will be repaid twofold.
The skies are full of dark clouds lately. I don't like it.
What's all these scratches in the dirt? Some sort of ritual?
I am about to summon the soul trap! Get ready!
[Goblin gibberish bragging about the size of her sword]
You! Stand and fight!
Another banquet for King Boar!
Both a beginning and an end that we bring about.
I might have need of you in about four hundred and thirty-three of your years. It's a minor scheme that I have been working on, but you would be perfect for it, and of course I would reward you. Do you think you could avoid dying until then?
No one could see this shot coming!
We don't need to be confident to get started. We need to get started to be confident.
The Argonian way is to do more with less. Believe me when I say that bag is … very Argonian.\n\nWhy not stretch a little?
<low rumbling growl>
I always get my cut.
Plenty of scheming going on down here, friend. We're up to our eyeballs in schemes!\n\nSpeaking of schemes, let's see the fruits of yours, eh?
It feels odd not to have a place to offer you if you need rest. But then, much is odd about Stonewastes right now. My own potions saved my hide.\n\nI have more for sale. Hopefully the funds can help us rebuild.
The Nibenese and Argonians might claim these lands, but by the blessings of the Moons, only the Khajiit can truly live upon this soil.\n\nAnd with those same blessings, shall we haggle over prices?
I've little time for talk.
You will die for that. I will make your last moments agony.
Good! Remember how you did that!
Try to run! Just try!
The wines of Leyawiin are worthy to use as toasts to the victories of my team.\n\nGo, Fire Drakes!
Why is it my hands always seem to be cold?
I wonder how long this rain will last?
I don't fear dark places so much as the things that lurk in them.
Right behind you, partner.
Your time on this plane has ended, spirit. The Far Shores call you. Go from this place and never return.
Worms find you before your grave! I will pluck out your eyes for this.
Why must you ruin my fun?
Who can I kill for the Prince of Destruction?
I heard the Bursio child has a broken leg. Probably tried to climb that damned tree again.
With so much to rebuild, even my claws are tired.
This damnable weather makes my bones ache.
I am so bored!
The last traveler to come through here brought a needed supply of new books. You have not.
Hmm. You don't look all that worse for wear. I take it the job went well?
I already told you about the work that's available. Well? The Saraathu Tong pay for results, not chit-chat.
You're not even going to try your indescribable horrors? Such ingratitude!
Dance in this destruction, children of the Deadlands!
Only the proudest champions of the Blackfeather Court rise to knighthood. What I need is a quest. Yes! A grand adventure! What should I seek? An ogre's eye? A Hagraven's mole-hair? No, no, those won't do.\n\nWait! I have it! A pewter spoon! Yes!
Is someone there …? Won't someone end this …?
I know what you're here for. My magic weapons and jewelry are the most potent available in this area. Let's get this transaction sorted quickly. There are matters I must attend to.
Disaster take you, mortal!
Psh, amateur. Be less suspicious!
Fool! Move away from me now.
The guards here will not be as gentle as the ones you are used to.
Fargrave needs more useful soil and fewer watchers. Their eyes are unsettling.
Why have the mortals come to Skein Row?
Have you stood before Lord Dagon yet? He's very … big.
Let the flames consume you!
I'm not looking forward to slowing down after my studies. I hope the Psijic Order can keep me busy.
I am Count Damard! I am the Ascendant Magus!
The poorest sailors and wealthiest nobles alike seek out my culinary delights. Try one, and you'll see why. In fact, you'll be begging for more!
The secret's safe now.
One good storm could wash this whole place away.
The sea is calm. The sky is clear. You're standing there. Now buy from here!
Fancy a game of Tribute? I promise, you won't find a player more eager to play and more likely to lose.
If you think you're ready to face my full power, by all means, give chase.
I would die for the master.
This isn't the right way.
Bretons have a natural aptitude for card games. Don't believe me? Well, have a seat then, and I'll show you!
I am one with Satakal.
I'll take a glass of wine, thank you.\n\nOh, my mistake. At first glance I thought you to be one of the servants. Deepest apologies.
This cat needs a nap after that!
You've made my life way more exciting. I hope I can return the favor!
This is my favorite part!
Recover your magicka, if you can!
I offered you my blade hardly knowing anything about you. You've been so kind to me ever since.
D-don't trust the sea! It'll betray you f-for the Fleet Queen and you'll end up like m-me!
They're hurting the Spirit of Stone!
I'll let my magic deal with you.
It's an honor to wear this armor!
I know your wounds hurt, little one. Nearly done with the poultice.
Please hurry. Galen is relying on you to prevent utter catastrophe.
Now, I don't know the first thing about Sea Elves or Dreadsails or what have you.\n\nWhat I do know is how to kick back and enjoy a brew. You should try it.
There's nothing like drinking a fresh brew and letting the sea breeze through your hair.\n\nGive it a try, the weather is great.
I once had a mentor who advised licking the wood before you worked it. Swore he could taste the shape it would take.\n\nI for one won't be risking the splinters.
Many new faces in Vastyr these days. It certainly gives me a feeling. I'm sure you feel it too.
Careful where you point all your sharp bits and hard edges. Everything in here is very delicate. Well, everything save for myself.
I love a good pair of gloves, no, wait, a belt! Yes, a good belt, or perhaps boots? Yes, big, thick boots. No, no. Belt. That's my final answer.
You can't defeat me!
How sleek! How delightful!
Select your crate and we can begin. Most crates contain four rewards, but sometimes you will get a special fifth reward!
Sometimes the sunrise over the water makes me believe I've seen Tava's red feathers splayed out across the very sky.
Ah, you poor creature. I can sense the bloodthirst within you. If you have need, I will gladly put you out of your misery. Just say the word.
What an unholy stink! It's horrible!
Still a bit too hot, I'm afraid. I can't put the blade in just yet.
How can you do this? You're one of us, aren't you?
Do you want to get sick? Get out of here.
Knowing secrets is like slowly freezing to death. Painful. Numbing.
I found a nice silver ring! Maybe?
The Arm of Trinimac bears arms against our enemies, shielding us in our darkest hour.
My mother told me not to go to sea!
What? What is it?
It burns! My skin … it's on fire!
I think it's time to pack up and move to Daggerfall. That should be safer than Crosswych, I imagine.
We've got the bastards on the run now!
Why can't I find my home? This is maddening. I've been looking for so long.
More food for my little ones.
Meddlesome wretch!
Nobody disturbs the masters!
Mathiisen steel is the best in Auridon. Perhaps the best in the south. Well worth the trip, most days.
The Guild requests your help!
Mara's heart, this place is lovely. Might have to bring my sweetie here someday.
… putting enemies off guard!
This one hears that Colovian mages were summoning Elven ghosts to aid them at Senalana.
The Withered Hand comes with Satakal's blessing.
I'll make <<1>> proud.
I need more time. Don't let those creatures get past you!
Glad you're here. I have another mission for you.
My light shall lead the way.
Molag Bal's slime imbues it. Scrub it with our blades!
Curtain! Curtain! Let the show begin!
That might have been a fair fight if there were three of you!
Where are you, Osgrikh? You can't hide forever!
The Pact, and glory!
Sahalu is full of big ideas! \n\nInstead of digging through the rock, we should dig underneath! No one listens to Sahalu, though. "We'll get crushed," they say. Feh. Ziss on them. I dig my hole anyway.
The Learned One did not create this realm for you. Leave, or be destroyed.
Die!
Akatosh be praised—a fighter with Guild stripes. We've got work to do, comrade.
It's a shame everyone who doesn't want to fight just can't get up and leave the field of battle. Imagine how much better wars would be if the only participants actually wanted to be there.
Writhe in fire!
This one knows how you die.
Come! Do your trading here!
If you see General Nedras, please do not tell him you have seen this one.
This one is still here, as you see. No fresh air for Tapak.\n\nNot that the air of Imperial City is too fresh anyways ….
Intruders! Crush them!
You interrupt me once again, wretch?
I'd keep that weapon in hand if I were you. As soon as you step into the sewers, you'll need it. \n\nWe have made very little progress in making the sewers more secure.
Beware the catacombs, stranger. There are things far more dangerous than Legion Zero soldiers down there.
Anitir! Tsabinna! Come back, don't leave me here! Noooo!
Smash those rifts or be overwhelmed!
White-Gold Tower is now the gravestone of the Empire!
Let me see ... so that is the crime you committed? I was hoping for someone a little more notorious.
I've got a great epitaph for your tombstone. 'Did not pay bounty.' Has a nice ring to it.
Please, please ... refuse to pay. I haven't smashed a felon in a tree's age.
I'll never understand criminals. You all get caught, eventually.
You've reached the crossroads of fate, my friend. Pay in gold or pay in blood.
This one loves justice. And gold. Lucky me, I will claim both!
All right, lawbreaker, time to pay for your crimes. You are going to pay, right?
You know what? You're such a good sort that I think I'll pay your bounty for you. That was a joke.
Great! Another criminal who hasn't paid the bounty! This is your chance to settle up, troll-breath!
I have my own worries to deal with.
Save me from that criminal.
Guards, there's been a crime!
You are not being very subtle.
I have done nothing wrong.
You make my skin dry, criminal.
As long as you leave me be, I don't care what you do.
By the Egg! Someone's been killled!
I saw a murder, right in front of my eyes.
An innocent creature slaughtered. You will pay.
You poached from another's nest. I saw.
Thief. Oh yes, I saw.
I hate to call the guards, but I will if you make me.
I saw that. It was murder, plain and simple.
Quit it, you sneaky viper!
No need to worry about me, I'm scared of my own shadow.
It's almost a crime to call that a crime.
Of all the outrageous--Guard!
The wicked never prosper, you wretch!
Don't try to run, you cad!
Stay away! I mean it!
Did you really think you'd get away with it? You won't!
Please don't hurt me. I'll be quiet.
Trust me, you don't want this. Back off!
Back! Back I said!
I want no part of this!
The guards can be here in a matter of seconds.
Dumac take you, you … you killer!
Why won't the guards do something?
Does it look like I care?
Sleek. Keep up the good work, walker.
Ha! I caught you!
You are acting very suspiciously, walker.
Please, no trouble! This one's tail is quite delicate!
This one hopes you are not planning to do anything foolish.
You are acting very suspiciously, walker.
Someone signal the guards.
This one knows a law has been broken.
Look, a thief!
Who's totally obvious, guilty as sin, and drinks milk? Three guesses.
Shor's bones!
You're making a fool of yourself.
I'm friends with the guard, just so you know.
I wish people would just abide by the law.
Don't drag me into this. I don't want to get hurt.
Someone stop that person.
I'll call the guard if you do anything rash.
You think you're tough, attacking me?
What exactly do you think you're doing?
You just got yourself a bounty, thief.
You don't see me, and I don't see you.
Are you really going to try that? You'll get caught.
I won't beat your lawbreaking hide. That's the Guard's job.
I don't have time for this.
Yeah--I see you.
Don't let the criminal escape.
Murder! There's been a murder!
I'm calling the Guard, Goblin-spawn.
Criminals are so unoriginal these days.
On my honor, you'll pay for your crimes. Guard!
I'd never make your crimes known.
I'd never make your crimes known.
Guards! There's a criminal here!
I will call the guard if I must. Move on.
Falx Maraennius.
You've ruined my livelihood! What will I do without my herd?
I'm not going to work in this inn forever. That's my father's dream, not mine.\n\nMe? I plan to travel. See the world. Go out and make a name for myself. Just like King Kurog did.
Trinimac blesses us all, but he has a special gift for his favorite Orcs.
If I'm to fight in a stinking cesspool, I'd rather be assigned to Shadowfen.
Attack, durzog, attack!
Quite a view, eh? Alas, there's no time to enjoy it. A merchant's work is never done.\n\nSpeaking of which, what can I do for you?
Become ashes and dust!
I'm afraid the chill can't numb shame.
Come, my lovelies! It's dinner time.
Please behave yourself around the Caravan Company guards. They're more ornery than usual, what with all the Iron Orc trouble and everything.
Must you? Really, must you?
Fame is fleeting, but a home is forever. So if I were you, I'd stock up now while you still have the chance.
Ah! Ooooh!
Browse the best wares the Telvanni have to offer!
Ah, Redoran, most noble of the Great Houses!
We'll walk the length and breadth of Vvardenfell to find Omellian if we have to.
To me, wretch.
Keep away from the urns, wretch!
The next Dark Elf that tells me I missed a spot is going to regret it.
I meet the most interesting people during my travels. And the most attractive, of course. Now, what would you like to buy?
I'm glad you want to help, but don't work yourself sick. Take a break.
Slaves to Orryn. Now is your time!
Hears-the-Winding is different from the other apostles. She's even offered to teach me how to read. My egg-sister must have gone through much hardship to have grown such kindness.
Integral components compromised.
Integrity compromised. Ceasing all functions.
My only pulse is lightning. How it burns!
Do any of these crates smell lucky to you?
Ooooh.
Our research will continue! You can't stop us!
My friend, behind my shield!
This island, this world, it shall all be ours!
To me, my shadow warriors! To me!
Did you truly think you could stop the mighty Maormer?
A valiant effort, though useless none the less.
Rip that one apart first!
There's always something more to do. Jee-Lar only needs to discover where to concentrate next.
The way some of these Argonian mages talk about their magic is … frustrating, to say the least. "A smidgen of this root, a pinch of that. Feel the wind! Let the earth move you!"\n\nReally, how can one practice under such uncontrolled conditions?
The Root-Whisper tribe continues to grow, but our resources do not. Will you lend your aid once more, Rootmender?
I don't buy Sulahkeesh's sweet granny act for one second. Once a Shadowscale, always a Shadowscale. That's why I pay my respects when I see her.\n\nYou'd best do so too, unless you want to end up face down in the swamp with a slit throat.
Lilmoth is known as the festering jewel of Murkmire. And we, beeko? We're the decay.
The tree takes in its nourishment, no matter the source it comes from. So too do I accept that which you have acquired.
Touch my stuff, I break your hand.
You know what makes up for these disgusting living conditions? The equally disgusting food.
Predictable, Quintus.
Can't you feel the call of Maarselok?
Be gone from her domain!
Had another run in with Sugar-Slinger the other day. Nothing I hate more than a stuck up smuggler.
Curs! I'll burn you out of existence.
My shield will protect you!
Your army is an embarrassment.
Be decisive. Be bold. Anything less is a disservice to your own state of being.
Dark Moons, Dragons are bad for crops, for animals, and for me! Others can handle this!
When facing a Dragon, sound tactics dictate more forces than are present. Retreat!
This Dragon business is beyond me!
There is no moisture in those bones, or in your actions.

You would do this to our ancestors? Honorless dog!
You faithless coward! Let the dead rest in peace!
Death by a thousand fangs!
I'm blessed in that I have now worked with wood local to Senchal and Elsweyr, so I know more than I did before arriving here.
Reman had to be both. So will I.
You earned a rest. Besides, I don't have anything else for you today. Come back tomorrow, eh?
Scatter them to the winds, Gohlla!
I'll claim you all for Maarselok!
You are pirates, yes? Khajiit can learn to sail, if you just untie this one!
Mask-bearer! Call upon my might!
I'll do my best to at least feed and shelter these people. Times like these, helping is more important than profit.
You're pretty good! I guess it's time to call in the muscle.
Ah, you're the first one back today. Hopefully not the only one. Walk me through your findings, if you'd be so kind?
The Coterie's work can be dangerous, but such is the price of enlightenment. Just think of the work that your findings might inspire!\n\nSpeaking of … if you haven't, you should speak with the author of the study straightaway!
I'm hoping you earn your reward. Mostly, so I can earn my commission.
I have all the time in the world. What I lack is patience.
I need a volunteer! You!
If you're interested in our legendary instrument, and the … minor division of the College these last few years, I can tell you this.\n\nI would have expected Hrofgen to side with me, but I suppose Thaezara already had her claws in him.
Hey, some of my best friends are werewolves.
This place isn't worth the trouble!
I'm too old for this.
You'll find I've improved the Dwarven designs.
I need hardy adventurers to assist me in helping the clans of the Reach. I'm willing to pay, if you can complete the task at hand.
I shall receive my Lady's blessing!
Lend me a hand here!
Like most Nords, I am an accomplished warrior. Of course, I have yet to prove myself in an actual battle. My father won't allow it.\n\nStill, if you ever get to see me fight, you'll immediately notice how good I am.
It's just clouds! A little rain won't hurt you!
I ventured into a mortal city recently and encountered—oh, what were they called again?—ah, mimes, that was it. I encountered mimes for the first time. They are absolutely horrifying. Well done.
Glad I brought plenty of arrows!
You have more shinies than you know what to do with, am I right? Here, let me help relieve you of some of them.
Ugh!
We have kept the twins safe, as the emperor commanded.
I need a healer!
Seeks once smuggled me onto a pirate ship in an orange barrel. Unfortunately, they loaded me on the bottom of the stack. Could have been worse. I didn't get scurvy and the citrus scent was pleasant enough—for the first few days.
[confused Goblin gibbering as though caught unawares by an enemy]
Focus on Cyronin! I won't let this thing near you.
Make this financial transaction with as little outward speech as possible. Your mortal tongue offends my ears.
Here, goat. Here, goat. Got some nice tasty garbage for you.
You'd think I'd have all the time in the world down here to keep my ledgers in shape, but no. \n\nDeposit or withdrawal?
Thieving? Bold, but foolish.
Sins require penance, mortal.
I can't believe you just did that! Someone help!
Innocent blood, my favorite.
Do you wish to sell your goods? Proceed when ready.\n\nPlease note that all exchange rates conform to observed market trends and are not negotiable.
Hezehk needs minions to command. Underlings to oppress. Something smaller and weaker that can wait on my every whim! Is that so much to ask?
Ember has seen much in her young life, not all of it good. Yet she retains an enthusiasm for learning. It's rather admirable for one of her circumstances.
Think you're the best Tribute player around? Shuffle those cards and prove it.
Phew! Thanks for keeping me alive!
Tell your dark master who sent you!
It could not be avoided.
This will serve, I think ….
You won't make it past me.
Root rot. Burn it out. Out, out!
Y'ffre bless your passing!
I need no large beast to end you.
Such a pitiful attempt.
Shh, listen, you can hear it buzzing around, can't you?
Triangles. They taste like silver. Like water. I never knew.
Sometimes the wind brings noises over the trees. Chanting. Screams.
Wood Orcs and Redguards … working together?
I know every tract in the Temple. I've read every prayer. And still I don't understand why good things happen to Argonians.
Festival of Defiance. The finest days to be in Skywatch, truly.
These Breton warriors think they are better because they call themselves 'knights.' When the Covenant is called to battle, they will see Redguard valor and they will know the truth.
Do you think the nobles would notice if I slipped out for a brew?
Hail, wayfarer! Enjoy your time at the heart of the guild.
What have we done?
Keep just the works of the people that your holy light of truth may shine across Tamriel.
You picked the wrong side, stranger.
Why does Hircine shun us? The Valenwood needs him!
The Hollow City is a strange place. I wonder how long it's been here.
M'aiq thinks those with the most wine can never truly be pleased. This is why he drinks water.
Honest merchant! Trust this one!
We've never been a large clan. We stick to ourselves, mind our own business. That's served us well, both when my father was chief and under the current chief of the clan.
Something's wrong.
The Lord Warden grants you another chance at life! Now kill the intruders!
This is no longer a place for mortals, maggot!
Don't try to run from me. Because I'll ... I'll chase you. Just pay the bounty, all right?
Pay your bounty or I start ripping the heads off of pony guars. And when I run out of pony guars ....
I'm sure you've done this before so you know the drill. Pay your bounty and you're free to go.
This one hopes your purse is deep. The price for a life of crime is high indeed.
All right, you broke the law so now ... uhm .... Oh right, now you gotta pay the bounty!
You are on notice, lawbreaker. Pay your bounty or face the wrath of justice!
Gold, or a beating. You choose.
Nirn preserve us!
You thieving scum!
By the firmament, I want no part of this.
Don't test me or I'll call the Guard.
All this blood …. It's ... Oomph!
Don't you touch me!
How could anyone be so wicked?
That bounty will follow you to Oblivion.
You will pay for that. I promise.
Hey! That crossed the line!
Thief! Caught with a hand in the biscuit jar too.
Oh, you're in for it now.
I'm not kidding around. Stay back!
Laws are High Elf inventions, so what do I care?
There's no leaves off my branch if you commit a crime.
The mark of a criminal is upon you.
Ugh. What is the world coming to? Guard!
The Guard didn't notice? Oh well.
We don't make laws so louts like you can break them.
Just another day in this rat-hole town ….
Please! I want no part of this!
I didn't see that. No, sure didn't.
I suggest you leave. Now.
What's the meaning of this? Don't make me call the guard.
No crime is too petty. You'll pay.
Go away and I won't call the guards.
You're a wretched fiend!
By the Three! What a terrible thing!
Not here you don't! You'll pay for that!
This one just wants to be left alone.
Jone and Jode … how could this happen?
Don't let the lawbreaker get away!
What are you doing over there?
Guards! That's the criminal!
This one saw what you did.
You will pay for your crimes, monster!
I might call a guard, but not until I finish my mead.
Did you actually think you could get away with that?
Secret, what secret? I don't know and I don't care.
I'm going! I'm going! Shor's bones ….
Stop that skeeving you … you skeever!
I'm warning you!
Shor take you and leave me be.
This used to be such a safe place.
I know better than to step in other people's … dung.
Stay away!
No need to concern yourself, I've forgotten you already.
Guards! Catch that thief!
Sound the alarm and protect your valuables.
Someone needs to deal with this dog.
You see? All is not lost!
Ha ha ha!
It's not your fault you weren't born an Orc. Trinimac blesses you anyway.
Hail and well met, friend Orc! Have you listened to the powerful words of Malacath recently?
Death is your only escape.
A most satisfying sound, the clink of coin. More satisfying to sleep on it. Pains the neck, though.
Your judgment will be swift!
Oh, let me get that, you've got enough on your shoulders. They are nice shoulders, by the way.
This one wishes you great luck!
You killed so many of my followers, but they still serve.
Minor larceny committed on storage compartment.

You may outrun the snake, but never the venom.
In my opinion, stolen wine always tastes better.
That cargo is just begging for us to steal it!
Can we start telling each other when a trap is set? I almost lost my damn paw this morning!
Auri-El's hand, my fate seems grim!
A Dragon? I erect the spine of profound terror.

Hrmm. Do I smell … cowardice?
If your hands are blistered, you're doing it right!
There! Glad that worked. Now get him!
Have you heard about the Dragon sightings? I don't know what the fuss is all about. How tough could they be if the lot of them were mostly killed off centuries ago? Reachfolk have been warring with Nords for a lot longer and we're still kicking!
Hmm. I seem to be going through ingredients more quickly than I anticipated.\n\nIs five soups a day too many soups? No, of course not! What a ridiculous question.
How could I know that I'd need my special minotaur-killing arrows?
You will pay for disrupting our work!
You think you're powerful? Don't make me laugh.
Mom and dad give their best.
You can't imagine what the Waking Flame has accomplished here, with me. Maybe I'll let you live long enough to see it.
Right in front of a guard? That's bold, mortal.
Come, mortals. Face me!
You can get back on your feet, come on!
Look, I like adventuring with you, but I don't have the attention span for this. I was born without it.
Do you think Maj noticed us returning to the enclave? I hope she did.
I'm not going to go looking. I was just curious.
You will need to purchase a crate from the store to continue, my friend.
I've long admired Druid Laurel. Even as children, she was always the more fearless of the two of us. She wasn't shy about chastising me for my soft, noble ways, either. I developed quite a tough skin from her teasing, I like to think.
Are those gold coins I see?
Look up, at that lighthouse. Quite a sight. Hope my Moroth is safe.
Come here and let me show you the pointy end of my sword.
In Daggerfall, packs of these horrible monsters roam the streets at night and prey upon the unwary!
Liar!
Dirt and sea will become gestating earth and primordial surf.
Be a darling and burn for me!
"Do not look to the day's end, lest it come and your work remain unfinished."
Your kind works so hard to survive. Why?
Cease and desist in your actions, villain! I require your payment!
There's a bounty on your head and I'll see it paid in full. Might even bring a smile to my face.
I don't hold your malformed sense of morality against you, but I'm afraid you must pay a fine.
No sudden moves. Pay the bounty.
I may be ineb … intox … I may be drunk, but I am no criminal. I don't think. Now pay up!
You break the law, you pay the fine. Simple.
The next person that even mentions the name Trinimac finds out why I call my walking stick "Head-Cracker."
I can't help you. Just leave me alone.
Hand over the pig and nobody gets hurt!
I thought the horned raiders were just rumors … I should have listened.
We'll purge it all. Wipe it clean.
Feel our blessing! Oozing! Pulsing!
Do you truly think you can stand against my shadows?
You're safe with the pack. Calm down, calm down. You're safe.
Keep to the shadows.
<Loud snarling.>
<Proud Goblin gibberish.>
Who will weep for you?
I command the power of death!
Xulunaht voss!
Trade with Khajiit, hmm?
That noise … No! This one is too old for this!
She hopes the next batch is safe. Even sugar-tooths won't buy skooma that drives you mad.
Ever had moon-sugarcane cider? So sticky sweet it coats your tongue and the little bubbles tickle your throat. Like Jone and Jode showering you with kisses. Ah, but it sours too quickly. You only find it brewed on sugar farms.
We sent them packing!
Can't wait to see what happens after a swift kick between the legs with these.
You're looking especially strong lately, I like it!
Ugh, fish creep me out. Their weird little eyes and mouths ... I hate looking at them.
That was way more fun than squire training.
Nice place this, eh chum? So, where do they keep the Tribute cards? I just like to examine other people's collections. Professional curiosity, you understand.
Really ought to get a boat for this sort of thing.
Another earthquake, huh? Wanna place bets on the damage?
It's hotter than a Dragon's innards! Let's cool it down some.
What did these cruel bandits hope to find here? Did they want our fish?
Wrong answer!
Who did that?
I have orders to collect your bounty. Save your protests for someone who cares.
There are many paths through the forest of life. For you? I think your best option is to pay your fine.
If it were up to me, I'd put you in a cell and throw away the key.
The law demands recompense for your criminal acts.
Well now. Neither of us wants to be here. Sooner you pay, sooner we can go.
My back hurts and my eyes are tired, but justice will be served.
Too much gold weighing you down? Shall we unburden you?
Hangman coming.
Come to deliver our little 'private contract'?
Your actions are not allowed within the Fortress.
Exceptional!
I must check my webs. Perhaps some prey has been caught.
Rub fins? You aren't good enough to polish my scales!
That's the plan? And how many of us do you expect to survive?
Error. Dreaming …. Missing Location Information.
I once met a Nord who asked if I would make a soup with mead. By the Egg, I thought them mad. But once I perfected the recipe, it turned out delicious.\n\nNow, don't go getting any ideas. I still hate taking requests.
There's a difference between killing in battle and killing in cold blood. I think you've forgotten that.
I think I'm bleeding!
Perhaps I should develop a hobby. Tailoring? No, too much like sewing the tears in Lady Laurent's undergarments. Beekeeper? No, I'm dreadfully afraid of the stings.\n\nI shall need to ponder further.
People always ask me what weapon I favor. Truth is, I favor anything within arm's reach that's heavier than a pillow.\n\nI tried to fend off a rival with a pillow once. Ah, that was adorable.
Isobel Veloise, at your service.
Do you like stinky fish? Rigurt loves stinky fish! The fishmonger in Lower Yorgrim sells the stinkiest!
You would like the sands, I think.
I will drive Men and Mer from Nirn.
I cannot be seen like this! Avert your eyes!
Did you come here to be processed, mortal? We will indulge you!
You haven't paid for your crimes. Hand over you bounty so I can get back to the tavern.
What a catch! I'll certainly have a story to tell tomorrow at muster! Now, about that bounty ....
The book of laws is clear--pay your bounty or your punishment will be more than you can bear.
It's not this one's place to judge, only to collect the bounty that is owed.
Let's see. So that's what you did, huh? Why am I not surprised? Just pay your bounty and you can go.
Shh! Don't tell anyone I was drinking on duty. Just ... just pay your bounty and be on your way.
No no no! Now, from the back! Rush!
I am not your bodyguard, but I will deliver custody to your next of kin.
That's odd, I could have sworn I heard something.
The pain. The darkness. It keeps me alive.
The mystery of the unflipped cards is Pacrooti's favorite part!
The Abyssal Cabal claims Summerset for the Sea Sload!
Don't tell Madam Whim, but I found a way to shave eons from my debt. By the time I finish, she will owe me. And oh, she'll hop and run at Hezehk's command! That is the dream!
Ha! I knew you missed me.
They'll be missing that.
Can I give you a bit of friendly advice before you get too involved with the cards? You have a tell. It's subtle, but I can see it. The trick is to always imagine your opponent as the most boring person alive. \n\nLike, you know, the opposite of me.
Privateers are often confused with pirates, but there's a world of difference. Privateers have permission to take your stuff. And we're usually more polite about it.
Your pathetic attempts to save this world amuse me.
Ah, it's my unwitting tool. Return to my realm and serve me.
The master demands your death. I hear and obey.
The fire and light take you.
Looks about right, there. Don't see too many of these lately. My contact will be so pleased to find so many intact.
Well fought … but now things get serious!
And the challenger is the clear victor!
Return soon, my sleek friend. This one is always pleased to see  you!
Stupendous!
Great, now I'm hearing things.
Can you feel my cold touch, mortals?
Should we kill them quickly, or do we have time to play?
At last, a fight worth watching!
Enough with the books already! Even a scholar must exercise his other muscles occasionally.\n\nHmm, this one wonders what Tara the Nimble is up to right now.
When he was my age, my father, Jorunn the Skald-King, was adventuring around the world with the Pack of Bards. But can I step outside the Palace of Kings without a dozen royal guards snapping at my heels?\n\nNot in this lifetime.
I have to admit, I miss the fires. Mehrunes Dagon rituals always had lots of fires. I loved staring into the dancing flames.
Let's go!
Nothing is too big or too bad for us to handle!
Every day I feel like I understand more about magic than I did before.
Stendarr is with you. I can feel it.
Varen's gambit nearly handed the empire to Mannimarco—and Nirn to me.
Look around. Sanctum Ophidia will be your grave!
I demand restoration!
Valga Crassus.
You've done well so far! Now, however….
Many thanks, and may you come safely to your journey's end.
A suitable reward.
Mmmmmmm.
Strongbox protocols engaged.
Let's get started!
This one wonders what your next crate holds.
Oh how you amuse me, my dear, dear mortal!
People call us Daedra! Can you imagine? Daedra … feh. Like the Blackfeather Court has anything in common with that rabble! Do those ugly, toddler-sized Banekin have knights and ladies? I think not!
M'aiq is called the Liar, yet not a word this one utters is untrue.\n\nAlas, seeds of truth can bear strange fruits in overly fertile minds.
As a vampire hunter, I must keep my own council about my travels. My comings and goings, therefore, may be sporadic. Secretive. This is a necessity of my calling.
I, Akatosh, will smite thee!
Be gone.
If I have to wait around anyway, the least you could do is bring me a pillow.
Defeated? Oh how little you understand, mortal flea!
Meet at the ship and we'll divide the plunder.
(Goblin GIbberish 11)
The trouble with the mortal realm is that it's full of mortals. I would almost like the place if it weren't so crowded with so many of your kind. No offense.
They can't lock us up like this!
I surrender to nothing, except a notarized certificate of deposit.
A suitable reward.
Lord Silvelle taught me that a good horse is smarter than his rider, but under no circumstances should the horse be allowed to know this.
Being a squire is hard work. We polish our knights' talons, organize their piles of shinies ….\n\nWhen I finally earn my knighthood, I'll treat my ward with nothing but respect. Until they step out of line. Then I'll really let them have it!
A solid pick.
Dreaming …. Fish pond. Skipping stone.
If we burn all their cities, where would we raid?
Let's ride!
I shall commend your name when I deliver these.
There are reports of bandits on the roads. All rumors, I say. Your delivery shall be safe enough.
The brush of a thief's fingers can open my heart, but emptiness will be their only reward.
This could be good!
Hobbies? Fighting, drinking, carousing. Caterwauling. That's rather fun. \n\nAnd fighting. Did I mention I like to fight?
Let me know if you sell those at market. My cousin could use a set.
A day with Narsis Dren is an exciting day indeed!
Oh, I know that I complain about mortals and their habits, but you shouldn't take it personally. \n\nHezehk doesn't like anybody. Mortal, Daedra, or whatever.
I've been at this a long time, but I wager you could teach me a thing or two. What are you thinking?
I'm gonna show off a little!
I'm right beside you. Let's get out there.
When you destroy the next, this one will have returned.
ah!
This is most enjoyable.
I can't say I miss the Emperor—I never even knew him—but it feels wrong for the alliances to be fighting over the Empire's scraps.\n\nSay what you will, the Empire kept chaos at bay. It was good for that, at least.
This one will ensure your shipment reaches Cyrodiil. Thank you for your efforts!
It won't surprise me if your shipment ends up in Cyrodiil. Most things do, these days.
Solved the mystery, huh? That one really warped the mind.\n\nYou must be sharp. The reward is yours.
Squeak! Squeaker squeakums squeak, squeak!\n\nAh, it is pointless. One cannot explain visions of conquest in rat-speak.
I have a bad reputation for eating my enemies. It's so unfair! I don't eat everyone I defeat in battle. Only the tasty ones.
The plan is in place. You are but an inconvenience.
That's right. Grind them into the dirt.
Unlocking the mysteries of the universe? Is that what you do? It sure seems like it, stranger. I'm just glad the conundrum has been solved. A few coins, for your trouble.
"For the dog that barks, the gate is never open, but the dog that digs runs free."
Reflecting …. Reflecting ….
<yawn 2>
Why do they have to lock everything? It just slows down our progress.
My magic will destroy you!
May Seht's divine clockworks protect you, resident.
No one minds me roosting here, do they? I think this place has a lot to teach me. Such as how best to bother someone.\n\nIf I can annoy a hero of your stature, for example, harassing simple bumpkins should be as easy as plump-liver pie!
Feh. Hezehk had higher hopes for the mortal realm. Surely, I thought, there must be something on Nirn that Hezehk would find interesting. Alas ….\n\nPresent location notwithstanding!
Some folks say killing a bear's just like killing a man, but harder. Know what happens to them? They get eaten by bears.\n\nEvery fight's different, so be prepared.
Never let them go. Never, ever let them go.
First the waves, then the endless darkness!
The Sea Sloads are patient. We know we will win in the end.
The surest path to knighthood is the performance of great deeds. You are a doer of such deeds, correct? Maybe you can train me to kill a Dragon.\n\nHow hard can it be? You wingless peasants do it all the time, right?
For Stendarr!
The greatest knights have lords and ladies to woo. Woo! I tried to earn the affections of Lady Corngizzard, but she said she would only consider it if I was the last crow on Nirn.\n\nDo you suppose she wants me to murder everyone? Ambitious!
The crows of Tamriel are a peculiar bunch. They just stare, and stare, and stare. Why do they not speak? Speak!\n\nI'm not sure what they're plotting, but the Blackfeather Court is not easily outwitted!
I take no pleasure in killing. But I'm glad we're alive and they're not.
Anyone else?
To battle!
<Yelling.>
Get back, fiends!
All is not well.
Hm?
Ah, you again!
Ah, you again!
I wish *I* was off adventuring.
Ah, you again.
Attack!
Cheers!
Do I know you?
Get ready!
Greetings.
Ah, you again.
The deepest waters make the least noise.
Help!
No.
The gods have abandoned me.
Ah, you again!
Am I...dying?
Hm?
I eat well and stay fit, but I'll die anyway.
I eat well and stay fit, but I'll die anyway.
Well?
Please, accept my thanks.
If I may be of service?
It's good to see you!
Help me out, will you?
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
Yes?
Yes?
<Groan>
I'll be alright. I've had worse.
What is it?
You didn't forget me!
<Snore>
If I may be of service?
Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
What is it?
What is it?
You again?
Take care.
There's trouble afoot.
What?
Nice to see you again!
I beg your pardon...
I must finish this.
Let me out!
Please, will you help me?
<Snore>
Welcome!
What?
Why, look who it is.
<Groan>

This is...unbearable.

Never trust an elf. Pointy-eared back stabbers!
Keep it down. You'll wake the dead!
I lost it somewhere...along with my dignity, ha ha!

Bring me a hollowed-out skull.
The ritual has begun. Prepare the sacrifice.

I didn't do anything!
Don't I know you?

I'm still here...for now.
Let's go!
Back again?
Now what?
It's more than I can bear.
I'm miserable. Just...miserable.
Hm?

Back again?

Hail.
Back again?
Thank you.
What can I do for you?

It'll take a lot more than that to kill me.
What is it?
How may I be of assistance?
Help me...I have nothing.
Help me...I have nothing.
You've caught me at a busy time.
Wait for my signal!
I've done nothing wrong!
I've done nothing wrong!
Hello.
Well, what do we have here?
There's a familiar sight.
<Groan>
I must find some help.
I don't deserve this.
I can't feel my limbs.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
How may I be of assistance?
What is it?
I'm down...but not out.
This...this is bad.
I just need a coin or two.

I'll be at this awhile.

There's no proof! None!
Hello there.
<Groan>
Wounded...need help...
What?
Welcome, again!
I'm fading fast...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
You've come to the right place!
The only fish that go with the river's flow are the dead ones.
What?
I can't remember her name. The pretty one with the beard.
Are you going to add to my problems?
You've returned!
You're getting quite a reputation!
Thirsty?
Just a small donation.
Just a small donation.
<Groan>
<Groan>
What hope is there for me?
Need...help...

By Mauloch, what now?
Jone and Jode preserve us!
Well?
Hm?
Aid for a poor wretch?
A familiar face.

Hm?

Surprise me. Say something intelligent.
Help me!

No.
Fate mocks me.
A familiar face!
<Snore>
<sigh> Again?
A familiar face.

<sigh> Again?
I'm alright...I'm up.
What do you want?
Good to see you!
Yes?
I've little time for talk.
Have you come to free me?
Have you come to free me?
Have you come to free me?
Help!
Hear me out...please!
Yes?
Good to see you!
When this watch is over, it's the cornerclub for me.
What do you want?
Woe and misery!
I'm...pretty bad off.
<Nightmare mumble>
I thought I was done for.
Good to see you!
Yes?
What do you want?
What do you want now?

I'm well enough to fight.
I've never known fear like this.

<sigh> I could use a break.
Let me out, curse you!
Just hear my side of the story!
Good to see you again!
Speak...very...slowly.
Hello.

Hello.
I must be cursed.

Hello.
Something I can do for you?
Do not add to my problems.
So, you're back.
Please...somebody...come to my aid!
<Groan>
<Groan>
So, you've returned!
I'm weakening...
Buy something, will you?
The Thalmor commands!
Did you see his new bow? That must have cost him.
Did you see his new bow? That must have cost him.
Please! I was once like you!
P-please...please!

I broke six lock picks opening an empty chest.
The ritual needs fresh blood!
I must warn you, I'm in a foul mood.

Back for more, are you?
Ah, it's you.
Ah, it's you.
Help me...please!
Help me...please!
I'd hoped to be better by your return.
Hope is a joke.
Is this...the end?
<Nightmare mumble>
Hm?
Greetings.
<sigh> Again?

All hope seems lost.
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
Aldmeri grandeur!
Yes?
What do you want now?

We should keep moving.
What are you waiting for?
My courage has fled.
How about a coin or two?
How about a coin or two?
Let me go!
My captivity is undeserved.
It's you!
Some drink to forget. I drink to remember!
Is there no hope?
It's you. Well, well.
What?
Hey, what's a little extortion among friends?
What?
What?

Welcome back!
Well, well!
You have returned!
I'm so hungry.
Why won't anyone listen to me?
Welcome back!

A few coins would suffice.

I wish *I* was off adventuring.
Hey! I didn't do it!
A grave miscarriage of justice!
Hm?
Don't you owe me money?
<Groan>
Hm?
Ah, you again.
Head out!
The gods have abandoned me.
Ah, you again!
Am I...dying?
I'm no better than before.

Blood for the Pact!
Ah, you again.
Well?
Now what?

Well?
Now what?
Now what?
Don't worry about me...
It's good to see you!
Now here's a likely one.
Help me out, will you?
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
I'm not the one!
I'd share but...I don't want to.
It's good to see you.
<Groan>
<Groan>
Yes?
You didn't forget me!
Indeed not.
What is it?
Honor and service!
Yes?
You again?
What is it?

Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
There's trouble afoot.
Let's keep it short, shall we?
It's been awhile!
I beg your pardon...
<Groan>
<Groan>
I...can't stop shaking.
<Snore>
<Snore>
Welcome!
What do you need?
Still among the living, I see.
I try not to be superstitous. That brings bad luck.
Don't trifle with me.
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
You can't keep me like this!
Will no one believe my story?
<Groan>
Losing my strength...
You're back!
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
I've got the experience you need.
Let's sharpen those skills, shall we?
The Thalmor commands!
Pride of the Lion!
Must you bother me?
<Groan>
Why go on?
It costs you nothing to look.
<Groan>

Our next job better bring a lot of gold.

Are you not afraid?

I've done nothing wrong!
Hello.

Tell me what you need.
What is it?
That's what he said!
That's what she said!

I'm wounded...but I'll be alright.
Travel well.

This...this is bad.
Are you going to add to my problems?
Don't cross me.
Are you going to add to my problems?
Look who's here!
Safe travels, I hope!
Your custom is welcome here!

Listen up and learn something.
Listen well, I can teach you.
Can I interest you in something?

Two steps forward, two steps back.

Blade and bone! The pain!

Help!
I shouldn't be here!
Hear me out...please!
Hey, have one with me!
Good to see you.

At least I'm still alive.
Good to see you!

Life has become a burden.
Can't last much longer...

You've caught me at a busy time.
There's a familiar sight.
Wait for my signal!
I've done nothing wrong!
Yes?
You return! Drink with me!
Hello.
There's a familiar sight.
<Groan>
Onward!
You again?
You're back! I didn't think I'd make it.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
Yes?
How can I meet your needs?
What is it?
What is it?
Your purse, if you please.
<Scream>
This...this is bad.
Welcome, again!
You need something, no?
You need something, no?
Won't you help me?

Hello there.
You bring me business?
You've returned.

Need...help...
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
What is it?
Pride of the Lion!
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
I hope you're not bringing more trouble.
Take pity on me...
Why must I suffer so?
Why must I suffer so?
Too weak to move...

Death awaits me.

So much to do, so little time.
I've little time for talk.
Good to see you.
Help!
Hear me out...please!
I shouldn't be here!
I didn't do it, I tell you!
Hear me out...please!

Good to see you!
How might I be of assistance?
Come to do some business?
Come to do some business?
How might I be of assistance?

I cannot complain, but that does not seem to stop me.
There's no time to waste!
I've never known fear like this.

Help out a poor soul?

<sigh> I could use a break.

Let me out, curse you!
Oh, lookee here...
I know that face.
Can anyone assist me?
I feel so weak...
I'm...badly hurt...
I must be cursed.
I must be cursed.
I feel so weak...
<Snore>
To serve is my privilege.
Loyalty and service!
To serve is my privilege.
Gold may be the root of evil, but we all need roots.
What is it?
I've been hit!
<Scream>
My patience is wearing thin.
So, you've returned!
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
So, you've returned!
I'm weakening...

<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Do you wish to sharpen your skills?
What do you want?
I can't remember her name. The pretty one.
Please! I was once like you!
<Groan>
<Groan>
What is to become of me?
What is to become of me?
Care to bargain?
This one broke six lock picks opening an empty chest.
You'd better be worth my time.
Help me!

Open your heart...and your purse.
You've got the wrong one!
Hm?
And you are?
Defend yourself!
Hm?
Ah, it's you.
<sigh> Again?
Evil moons rule my fate.
I am cursed by Sithis.
<Nightmare mumble>
Hm?
Ah, it's you!
Well?

Hello again!
Customers are always welcome!
I don't belong here!
Yes?
I don't know you. Do I know you?
Hail.
Can you lend a hand?
Don't think...I'm going to make it.
Is that...really you?
Can you do anything to help me?
Hello again!
All hope seems lost.
Yes?
Hello again!
We must hurry!
How about a coin or two?
Let me go!
Hello there.
It's you!
This is the life, eh?
Hello there.
I bet you can take care of yourself without any help.
Diplomacy is the art of lying for your alliance.
I need your help.
It'll take more than this to kill me.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
May this one be of service?
It *is* you.
Nothing is certain until it happens.
Do you mind?
And what can I get for you?
There's always more to do.
Why won't anyone listen to me?
Well, well!
Somebody!
Well, well!
Things have never looked worse.
<Snore>
What next?
<Groan>
Whatever shall I do?

Don't you know I'm innocent?
Greetings.
Hm?
Help!
Help!
I'm glad you're back. I grow weak.
Help!
Greetings.
Ah, you again!
Now what?
I am dry with despair.
<Snore>
Greetings.
May I help you?
May I help you?
Well?
Now what?
I'm filled with dread...
Yes?
It's good to see you!
Help me out, will you?
Take pride in your work, I always say.
I thought I'd been abandoned.
I need help!
Hello.
I hope you've come to drink!
Weren't you just here?
Hello.
<Groan>
How long can I last like this?
What is it?
You again?
Does no one care?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Not a moment too soon.
It's good to see you!
Divulge your needs to this one!
Honor and service!
That one has voices in his head.
What is it?
He hears voices in his head. Don't worry, they're good people.
What is it?
<Scream>
There's trouble afoot.
What?
You should buy me a drink, I think.
<Groan>
Not a moment too soon!
Not a moment too soon!
Such pain...
I...can't stop shaking.
It's been awhile!
Welcome!
What?
What?
This one is livid!
This one is livid!
I've lost everything...
This is taking longer than I'd planned.
Why, look who it is.
Will no one come to my aid?
You can't keep me like this!
Why, look who it is.
<Groan>
Why, look who it is!
This is...unbearable.
You're back!
<Groan>
Must you bother me?
There's no end in sight.
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Why go on?
<Snore>
<Groan>
<Groan>
That coin-pouch getting heavy?
If someone would only help...
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
Are you not afraid?
Back again?
I'll be at this awhile.
Free me!
Here's the thing. I...I forget the thing.
Had a few while you were gone.
I need help!
I need help!
I'm still alive...for the moment.
I'm still alive...for the moment.

Hm?
What do you want?
Now what?

What do you want?
Give me a minute...
<Scream>
What is it?
You again?
There's a familiar sight!
Help me...I have nothing.
Help me...I have nothing.
This work never ends.
I need help!
Hello.
There's a familiar sight!
<Groan>
<Groan>
Yes?
You're back! I feared I wouldn't last.
There's a familiar sight!
Yes?
I can't feel my limbs.
<Nightmare mumble>
There's a familiar sight.
How can I meet your needs?
There's a familiar sight.
What is it?
What is it?
Well that's going to leave a scar.
Xuth!
This...this is bad.
I just need a coin or two.
I'll be at this awhile.
Safe travels, I hope.
There's no proof! None!
Someone will pay for this.
<Groan>
Will you help me?
Hello there.
My heart is heavy.
My heart is heavy.
<Groan>
<Nightmare mumble>
Hello there.
What do you want?
What do you want?
High Rock and Hammerfell!
What?
You'll have to make do with out me...
Just a small donation.
Just a small donation.
You've got it all wrong!
You've got it all wrong!
You must see that I don't belong here.
You've got it all wrong!
You've returned.
Need...help...
What hope is there for me?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
The Pact, and glory!
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
You're going to brave my wrath?
<Groan>
Too weak to move...
Looking for a bargain?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Groan>
Care to have a look?
<Groan>
<Groan>
<Snore>
<Groan>
Well?
A familiar face!

Hm?

Am I glad to see you!
You look...taller. Have you gotten taller?
I was just wondering about you...
Greetings.
A familiar face.
No.
No.
Greetings.
Hm?
A familiar face!
Curse this frail flesh.
<Nightmare mumble>
At last! I'm free!
Well?
Don't count me out just yet.
What do you want now?
Yes?
Don't look away.
Don't look away.
Don't look away.
Help!
Good to see you!
Good to see you.
<Groan>
Are you here to help?
Why this one? Why?
Will this torment never cease?
Good to see you!
Can't last much longer...
<Snore>
Yes?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want now?
Alkosh curse you!
Akatosh curse you!
Lets see what you've got there.
I've never known fear like this.
Ah, you're back!
<sigh> I could use a break.
Just hear my side of the story!
Let me out, curse you!
Oh, lookee here...
I know that face.
Ah, you're back.
Don't chase trouble or it will chase you.
Can anybody help me!
I'm...badly hurt...
I must be cursed.
I know that face!

<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
Hello.
How may I serve?
Oath of Ebonheart!
Good to see you again.
What is it?
Gold may be the root of evil, but we all need roots.
My patience is wearing thin.
I'm desperate...
I can't seem to get ahead here.
Over here! Hurry!
Someone's going to be sorry.
So, you've returned.
So, you've returned!
<Snore>
The dryskin fool saw me taking daril, so I gave him some. It's poison to their kind! Ha!
I can't remember her name. The pretty one.
Khajiit's family died when the plague spread through Senchal.
Please! I was once like you!
Please! I was once like you!
Please! I was once like you!
P-please...please!
Is it knowledge that you seek?
I must warn you, I'm in a foul mood.
<Groan>

Ah, it's you!

I'm a miserable sight, aren't I?

Ah, it's you.
Help me...please!
Hm?
My troubles overwhelm me.
My troubles overwhelm me.
I can't believe it...free!
<sigh> Again?
Ah, it's you.
Do not let yesterday's regrets become today's worries.
<sigh> Again?
You will give Khajiit some moon sugar, yes?
Curse you!
Hello again!
Have pity...
Help!
I don't belong here!
I forgot what I'm drinking to.
I forgot what I'm drinking to.
It's you! I always liked you.
Yes?
Yes?
Where words fail, claws flail!
Can you lend some help?
Can you do anything to help me?
What do you want now?
Don't think...I'm going to make it.
Hello again.
Customers are always welcome!
No sudden moves, now.
Hello again.
What do you want now?

Luck is not with you this day.
My courage has fled.
What annoyance is this?
Doesn't seem like I'm getting much done here.
Doesn't seem like I'm getting much done here.
Please...release me.
It's you. Well, well.
My captivity is undeserved.
Let me go!
Hello there.
What?
What?
May this one be of service?
It *is* you.
May this one be of service?
What?
Let me...catch my breath...
I'm so hungry.
There's always more to do.
This is all just a big misunderstanding!
This isn't right!
Why won't anyone listen to me?
<Groan>
<Groan>

You'd better not be another bother.
Quench yourself here.
<Groan>
<Snore>
This one will recite the invocation.
I'm just...livid!
Is it true what they say about the size of a Nord's...ego?

Need to lighten your load?
We serve the master, Molag Bal.

I have the ingredients you requested.
I've finished the job.
Ah, you again!
Ah, you again!
I wish *I* was off adventuring.

A grave miscarriage of justice!

Care to join me for another?

Ah, you again.

Hello.
It's good to see you!
I know what you need...a drink!
Yes?
It's good to see you.
I need help!
Welcome back! I'm...no better.
How can anything hurt so badly?
It's good to see you!
Does no one care?

How long can I last like this?
Welcome back! I'm...no better.
<Nightmare mumble>
<Snore>
<Snore>
Yes?
It's good to see you.
My thanks.
Yes?
Now here's a likely one.
Bah. Morality is a fool's game.
You again?
What is it?
What is it?
You again?
That was close.
There's trouble afoot.
What?
If it's not worth my time, keep moving.
I beg your pardon...
I must finish this.
Quickly now...
The injustice of it all...
This is the life, isn't it?
What're you looking at?
<Groan>
<Groan>
Still among the living, I see.
It's been awhile.
Must I suffer so?
I...can't stop shaking.
<Nightmare mumble>

<Snore>
It's been awhile.
Nice to see you again!
What do you need?

Did you hear something?
Wait, please...
I've had it, I tell you.
I've lost everything...
Somebody...please!
<Groan>
<Groan>

Why, look who it is!
Keep it down. You'll wake the dead!
I can't remember her name. The pretty one with the beard.
Spare a coin?

Why go on?
<Snore>
You'd better not be bringing more trouble.
Help!
<Groan>
<Snore>
That coin-pouch getting heavy?

Now what?
What can I do for you?
I'm in the middle of something.
Can't you see I'm innocent?
I didn't do anything wrong!
Back again?
Can anyone help me?
Now what?
Will this torment cease?
Will this torment cease?
<Nightmare mumble>
<Nightmare mumble>
I owe you my life.
What can I do for you?
Back again?
What do you want?
I'm well enough to carry on.
I'm so shaken!
What is it?
Help me...I have nothing.
Help me...I have nothing.
Yes?
You've caught me at a busy time.
I've done nothing wrong!
There's a familiar sight!
<Groan>
<Groan>
There's a familiar sight.
No, no...
I don't deserve this.
Tell me what you need.
<Nightmare mumble>
There's a familiar sight!

Need some assistance?
Yes, indeed.
You again?
What is it?
You again?
What is it?

Don't cross me.
Set me loose!
Safe travels, I hope.

You need something?
Your custom is welcome here!
Selling! Buying! Trading! Right here!

You've returned!
I've had just about enough of this.
Will nobody help?
You can't prove a thing!

Listen up and learn something.
Can I interest you in something?

Ysmir's beard! What is that terrible smell?
Only the dead will see an end to this war.
Take pity on me...

You desire enlightenment?
Looking for a bargain?
You've got some nerve...

I hate being afraid.
A coin to mention you in my prayers?

Absolutely not.
What do you want?
Hail.
I thought I was done for.
Good to see you!
Good to see you!
What do you want?
Go on...I'll pull through.
To Oblivion with you!
Good to see you again!
Ah, you're back!
<sigh> I could use a break.
Just hear my side of the story!
I'm injured! How it hurts...
I must be cursed.
Something I can do for you?
<Snore>
What brings you?
You wish to suffer my wrath?
Over here! I need help!
They've got no proof!
Well, look who's back.
Nobody cares at all.
So, you're back!
Have you come to barter?

The flesh fails me at last...
Well?
Alas for me!
Fate does not smile upon me.
I won't last the day...

Ah, it's you.
Thank you.
Ah, it's you.
Well?

Oh, this is bad. Bad!
It's been awhile!
Must I suffer so?
<Nightmare mumble>
Did you hear something?

Quench your thirst here!
I've lost everything...
Nothing to do but keep at it.
This is...unbearable.
Losing my strength...

Will you help me?

Look who's here!
<Snore>

You've returned.
Can I interest you in something?
What is it?
Pride of the Lion!
You're going to brave my wrath?

Instead, you expend a Magicka Charge. The crystals located at the top of the Antiquarian's Eye display your remaining charges. You can replenish these Magicka Charges by claiming Foci.

The ritual circle takes the restless spirits.
The Time Breach surges with power!
Move along, vagabond. Unless you've got an invitation?\n\nDidn't think so.
That's a fine how do you do! Do you make a habit of barging into a person's house?\n\nYou're lucky. If I weren't so exhausted, I'd knock you over the head with my broomstick.
If that Captain Thayer comes around here again, someone's going to get hurt! That wench called me a coward because I prefer to work here rather than join the Shornhelm Guard. \n\nSense of duty? Pfft! That's a pile of guar-dung!
I know I'm a long way from home, but I figure as long as I do my job, my life is nice and quiet.\n\nI do miss the forest, though.
A friendly face in our little village? That's a good omen!\n\nDon't mind the others. Many are distraught over the loss of our horses. I know the Herd Mother will look after us, as she always has.
Truly, I cannot thank you enough. You've saved my life.
This one begs your pardon, but Mister Munier tells me when he is expecting guests.\n\nIf you would kindly leave the premises, this would be most appreciated.
Greetings, traveler.
My children and my people suffer.\n\nThe Planemeld continues … but that's not why I'm restless.
This nightmare is neverending. All my choices have ended in death and destruction. The Daedra are everywhere now, poisoning my mind with their lies.\n\nYou must save the Daggerfall Covenant. Kill the Omen of Counting Stars!
You're the one who helped save our fields.\n\nListen—I may have discovered the source of Durak's affliction.
You! You look pretty dangerous. You're drafted. \n\nThere are Goblins here that need killing.
I did all that I could but there was just too many of them to fight off.
Never a dull day in Alcaire. These are thirsty times, my friend.
Being a dockworker has its benefits… the ocean breeze on my face, eating fresh fish for lunch and meeting new people every day.\n\nOn the downside, it stinks like rotten fish and I've gotten more splinters than I can count.
So many brave and injured knights. Some will not live to see tomorrow.
What's … where am I? Oh, gods, let me go!
The Daggerfall Covenant means nothing to me. It's political jousting, as far as I'm concerned. \n\nSo long as no one takes away my ale, the king can ally with whoever he wants.
One cannot simply swing a blade and expect success. Each novice here must forge a blade before learning to wield it.\n\nBy understanding what goes into making the blade, a novice can understand how it must be used.
I don't believe I've ever seen you at any of Hosni's parties.\n\nI'm sorry this one had to be your first.
My wife, Franara, wanted to move out to the country. So here we are, I guess.
Did my son send you, or are you just one of his feckless, doomed guests?
Eggs are such delicate, precious things. Such a thin shell!
Too busy, soldier. See Jeggord or Dar-Liurz.
This is a bleak homecoming.
Slavers attacking Koeglin Village? Doesn't make any sense.
You should be careful who you talk to around here.
Most of my provisions are needed for the soldiers. But I do have some things I can trade, if you've the coin.
Interested in a set of new clothes? Something in silk, perhaps? No one ever leaves my shop empty handed.
What are you doing here?
What're you doing back here? Come to give me some coin?
Thieves! Daggerfall is full of them! They steal anything that's not nailed down!\n\nThey even stole my livestock.
I've no time to answer questions. Whether the noble houses will be patient is the least of my worries.\n\nWe only have a brief opportunity, so we must attack. Our enemies grow stronger with each passing moment.
I'm tired of defending this backwater. There's work to be done in Camlorn and … oh, sorry. I thought you were one of my soldiers.
What a rousing speech! Makes you want to run out and join the Lion Guard!
I'm no warrior. I'm a chandler. Candles don't make very good weapons, you know.
Did Lord Diel send you? Well, there's nothing new to report, except that my brother is an idiot.\n\nArmel placed dozens of traps and he just realized something. Harpies don't walk! Now we're trying to figure out how to salvage the situation.
I can never decide. The market has so many choices.
I suffer eternal dishonor for failing my lady, the Emerald Princess. I am no longer worthy of the post I hold.
Sheathe your weapons. I am no wraith sent to drain your soul.
Yes? What is it?
To choose for oneself is simple. To choose for a nation is hard. The heaviest blade is as a feather compared to the trust of one's people.\n\nAbide with me and listen carefully.
Hearken, wayfarer! An opportunity for honor presents itself. Are you open to this challenge?
Before you speak, stranger, I would have words with you. For centuries, this cell has held me. You are not the first. Others tried to free me and failed.\n\nNo key will open this lock. No weapon will break these bonds.
I love having an isolated, quiet place for our studies, but I must admit, some of the alchemists and enchanters working here tend to be a bit … melodramatic.\n\nThat's often the result of seclusion and scholarly pursuits.
Crosswych isn't the best place to visit right now. If you do enter the town, try not to get noticed by the Red Rooks.\n\nIf you're good in a fight, though, you could join our resistance. We could really use the help.
When I heard the king was sending troops up here to fight that Reach-born bastard, I was ready to go within minutes.\n\nSay, this isn't your dog, is it?
Without your help, I would have been a meal for the jackals.
Be wary. We don't know what we're up against.
I just want to survive the night. That's all I ask.
The Hollow Wastes are unsettled right now. Difficult times for any traveler.
Why is my father still a prisoner? This wasn't his fault!\n\nPlease, you must tell the guard to release him.
Looking for fine wordcraft and fair prices? I've got what you need!
The sooner those unwanted guests leave, the better.
You did it! I heard you were headed here, so I rushed over to help, but you had already finished before I arrived.\n\nI never thought, when we were scouting the Imperials near here, that you would be the one to kick them out of the garrison. Amazing!
I'm not here to cause trouble. I've earned a living in the desert for the past twenty years. I know what you'll need. Would you like to see my wares?
I'm Holgunn, the Nord commander here in Davon's Watch. My men are the spine and strong arm of the Ebonheart Pact. \n\nI've heard good things about you. Let's see if they're true.
Welcome, traveler.
Vivec guide you, traveler.
I couldn't find him. Did you?
Why do you meddle in our affairs?
While you wait for the cure, my fine wares will keep you strong and healthy.
Begone! Your living breath pollutes our bone-dry air.
There you are, outsider. I came as quickly as I could.\n\nMadras and the others left for the ruins. They want to save our people but they're going to get themselves killed.
Rich times for some, not for all. Chee-Dooka and I have been … less than fortunate.\n\nBut, the sea brings new breeze each day. That is the saying, is it not?
Speak.
I purchase what I need from our allies.\n\nFor the Ebonheart Pact! Blood and glory!
Our curse is misunderstood by outsiders. We wish to remain here in peace, as we always have.
This plantation was built on suffering. It's only right that it should end in suffering.
Why won't Mournhold send reinforcements? This pass leads straight to the city.
Dolril came out of nowhere and saved me. I owe him my life!
Ha, what a sight! Ulawa thinks he's the best of the barrel, I suppose.\n\nA couple of rounds of cards and I'll win myself those pants right off him!
This is no place for the living, not anymore. If you're here to honor lost friends, you should come back next season.\n\nMaybe things will be better by then.
If you want to work on your technique, you can't be afraid to get burned. Come closer and I will show you.
We are allowing no one to approach the Hist, especially strangers claiming they wish to help us.\n\nWe just caught a Dark Elf trying to poison the tree.
I'm not captive anymore! And I'm still rich!
You've done a fine job here.
I am a merchant full of goodies.
These filthy pirates want to sell us all into slavery. Please, find a way to save us!
It has been a long time since I've made a sale.
Don't know why I even bother fishing. These damn crows snatch the blasted thing right off the line before you can pull it ashore.
Not so loud. You'll betray our position.
Lord Vivec, I was here when Belronen issued his challenge. He would still live if not for Fenila! She stoked the Telvanni's rage, urging him not to back away from an insult to his honor.\n\nShe called herself his friend. Curious way to show it.
Welcome to Shad Astula. I maintain the school's collection of manuscripts and books.
The son listened when cunning Boethiah whispered in his ear. He tried to steal an artifact from the Tribunal Temple—the hammer known as the Judgment of Veloth.\n\nMany of the Tribunal's faithful died gloriously that day!
How did you make it through the Daedra, stranger? \n\nWe're having a damned hard time just holding back the tide.
<The arbiter stands dormant. A loose panel slides open to reveal five empty sockets and five large pegs within its chest cavity.>\n\n<The panel bears a small but legible inscription.>
I knew I wasn't abandoned. The Three watch over you!
Vox is defeated and Veloth's Judgment returns to the Temple where it belongs. \n\nOur will prevails. Order shall be restored.
Well met, friend.
Come here. Quietly, please.
We want no trouble, outlander. My injury doesn't keep me from stringing a bow.
I've been beaten lower than a dock rat. What's it to you?
What are you doing here?\n\nNo matter. I have goods to trade. They're just trifles, except for that odd statue.
This one offers weapons to fit every hand!
Hmm. There's something about you.
Hello stranger, forgive me for not offering more hospitality but my family is in something of a crisis right now.
Hush, fool. Do you want to give my position away?
<Cough> Can you help me?
I'm so very tired of being kidnapped.
Hi, I'm an escape artist with amnesia. Can you help me?
Sinmur was the most frightening thing I'd ever seen. It stepped on the soldier right next to me, squashed him flat!
I need to go somewhere far from this chaos. Maybe I'll try Riften.
You see that thing? That's what's left of the Reachmen gathered at Vernim.
I didn't think we were going to make it out of there … Dajaheel. Belron.
Have you met my sister, Gabbi? I never understand what she's talking about, but she always seems to make a certain amount of sense.
I loved Tillrani, I really did, but I'm not going to let Trynhild run out of here lusting for revenge.\n\nI forbid it!
Can you see how wonderful this is? My prince has made all my dreams come true!
Thank you, Hero of Bleakrock. You're the Hero of Bal Foyen!
I am Nurnhilde, Queen of the Nords. I come to you from Sovngarde with an urgent demand.
The cool water flows and cleanses the mind. Stay a while and listen to the water, yes?
Damn that brother of mine. He went and got himself killed.\n\nAnd damn the Daggers, too. Every last one of them.
I'm a little busy at the moment. Come back later.
The time has come to crush Fildgor and the Stormfist Brigade once and for all.
We're out in the big world now. Tryn and I are going to get some real training.
I don't trust these guild mercenaries. Littrek may think they're heroes, but I know their type.\n\nShor's bones! If Darj hadn't proven himself worthy, I don't know where we would be.
Trynhild won't stop talking about these spell-slingers. It's all I can do to convince her not to join the Mages Guild.
My wretched cousin had me sold off to the Worm Cult as a sacrifice so he could steal my wife and my home.\n\nIf I ever get out of here….
What do you want?
Looks like you've been busy!
These are dangerous times to walk the roads alone, but one must make a living.
I'm not as strong or as fast as I used to be.
Mammoth tusks fetch a high price, but they aren't worth the risk. I'll stick to safer stock. Can I interest you in anything?
My stock isn't as plentiful as it once was, thanks to those thieving Drublog, but you're welcome to browse what remains.
Friend of the Silvenar, the Green Lady went by! The way is blocked to you, but I can clear it.\n\nShall I lend you my aid?
Nilara needs to get out and do more if she wants any respect.
We've done our part, now you do yours. Make sure the Reach do not return.
Did you find them? Is my family all right?
Boo! What, you've never seen a dead man before?
An outsider? Jaruk has not seen one in many years. Outsiders tend to be afraid of us.\n\nCome, pull up a seat. Let us entertain you. It's not like we're going anywhere, heh.
I found some new dresses amongst the Ra Gada's possessions. Hope some of them fit me.
Edherien and Elphiniel are always arguing. I come out here just to hear myself think!
I surprised a few of those Maormer bastards along the path up here. Now that we're all armed, we'll be fine.\n\nThank you for the assistance. May Auriel guide your blades in battle.
Bosmer drink strange things. I'm all for a well cooked steak. I'll even eat bugs! But throwing all that in a mammoth skin to rot for years on end?\n\nI'll stick with jagga.
Hello my excellent friend. Thank you for joining me on this auspicious occasion!
Back off! If you're with these monsters, I'll slice you open!
Why are you bothering me?\n\nI'll need to speak to my guards about letting every peasant disturb us.
My wife toils away in the mine while I stand here and wait for my stew to boil. What a life!
Greetings, Master Drenduf. As always, your memories are alive in me. How may I serve?
You did great work today. Thank you.
Have you seen all the Pact soldiers? Fort Amol is crawling with them!\n\nAnd do you know what that means? My till is full!
I really only know four chords, but no one seems to mind.
I find that quiet contemplation helps me prepare for battle.
Shor preserve us! Help!
If you need something, please talk to Master Benus. I have a lot of work to do today.
Fighting only hurts those that cannot defend themselves. And with the troubles the Houndsmen have brought about, I thought it was wise to prepare.\n\nI see now that I may have been … mistaken.
I've brought everything to the celebration! Well, what little the Hound didn't devour.
Did you bring the items I requested?
Z'en, have you abandoned us?
Which trial do you look forward to? I cannot wait to partake, and have my mind judged by the Hist.
Looking to hit something? Trust me, I understand.
Between the fumes and the berserk kwama, I didn't think I'd make it out of there.
I've never seen anything like it. The attackers used Dwarven spheres and spiders!
What are you looking at?
I'm hoping to find something for my nix hound, Anther, to eat.
I feel terrible, but I'm not worried. Vunden will take care of me.
Hey there, friend! Just looking for an ale? Or a chance at the trials?
Well met. You look a little lost. Are you looking for the kegs? Or the competition?
Such terrible things happen here.
Sanguine was here once. I saw him! He waved at me. Well, he told me to move along. What an honor!
I heard there was another stranger visiting the Vale. How tedious.
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who actually does any work around here.
My friends and I trained all our lives for this.\n\nA shame I was the only one who got selected. Maybe next season for them.
I don't know what's turned my stomach so horribly. True, this place is less than gourmet, but I thought a mug of mead would be safe!
Watch out! Some invaders made it inside!
Anther and I wanted to say thanks!
We help those who come to the Temple seeking aid. Often, we can deal with problems before they ever reach the Tribunal.
I don't know what's in this, but it tastes divine.
Jarakh came to find new trading opportunities, but all he found was danger.
Hmm … what? Go away … I'm trying to sleep.
Strangers seldom find peace in Stillrise. I suggest you leave while you can.
I'm sorry for the soldiers, but the rest of us have endured too much. It's time for this to end!
I feel like I'll never be safe again. \n\nFleeing the horrors of Camlorn, then taken in the night by cultist thugs. When will it all end?
We're just researchers. We don't stand a chance. The others are dead, or worse.
What is it?
The Mages Guild will never give up. No werewolf, undead or not, will harm the people of Glenumbra.\n\nWe'll find out how Faolchu fell and we'll put him right back in the grave.
<This man was killed by a massive club. He was stripped of all valuables, including his shirt.>
J'Eeja's wares are yours, friend, for a mere pittance.
I never thought much of the Wyrd, but the way they've taken us in shows they have good hearts.
This camp may not be what the survivors from the mill are used to, but it will have to do.
This would never happen in Summerset! Where is a justiciar when you need one?
Another fine night. Or is it day? Doesn't matter. The drinks are still coming.
I'm on a business visit from Vvardenfell. With the Argonians emancipated and Shadowfen open to the free market, there's plenty of money to be made.
I understand why we need Argonian and Dunmer vicecanons. But what do we need a Nord for? Drunken tie-breaker?
I've been studying at Shad Astula for two seasons now. I can't wait until I get my certificate and take my place as a Pact officer.
Halion is an unappreciated genius. Chorrol doesn't deserve him. Isn't he great?
What? My friend's looking for an heirloom that was put in the wrong coffin. Keep moving.
Hard to believe there aren't any beds available in town. I think it's anti-Orc racism!
We can't allow you to enter right now. My apologies.
Belosi's orders are very, very precise. She wants to get her caravan back on the road as soon as possible.
We make many decisions in life that we truly believe are correct when we make them.\n\nThis body, for example. It was a gift from the lord of this realm. He said it would grant me the power to topple the corruption of Glenumbra. He lied.
I don't know who you are, but I know you shouldn't be here.
I can do this. I really can. All I have to do is … oh, who am I kidding? I can't do this! There's no way!\n\nWhy did I ever think I could make it in the Fighters Guild?
Can't talk. I'm on duty. Last time I did, I got latrine cleaning for a month. Not going to make that mistake again.\n\nBloody Sovngarde, I'm doing it again!
This one doesn't understand the game the little Elf and the snake thing are playing, but we have something important to do! We need to get into this tower. The key to our victory, it's in there! I know this to be true!
Who are you and why are you here? Stop staring at me!
I'm in your debt. I will pray for Rupta to guide you in all your journeys.
This is madness. Why wasn't <<1>> around to stop these pirates?
Sharp. Pointed. Makes a clear statement to your enemies.\n\nNobody will make swords for you but Zhosh, so get them right here.
My food isn't anything to write home about, but it is hot and filling. Let me get you something.
Our Lady Almalexia has asked us to keep an eye on Vox's forces until her champion arrives.\n\nWe'll make our stand here if her troops attempt to leave this place. Though we may fall in battle, we do so in the name of our Lady.
Well, what'll it be? Don't waste my time.
If you find a hair in your drink, blame the dog. Mutt sheds like a dead pine.
Another time, friend.
Walk with courage.
An Argonian singing the praises of the Three? That's just not … right.
I never thought I'd see the day. An Argonian, walking free and worshiping the Tribunal. It's … inspiring.
Miraculous. To think that the Dwemer of old Volenfell settled as far as Stros M'Kai! \n\nMy brother and I have scoured the ruin's exterior for some time now, but we have never been able to get inside.
Take it from me: the best garments are the ones you make yourself. I've got some goods that might help, if you're interested.
That's a great inn, but I can't stay in there all day drinking. Sometimes, I need to step outside and get some air.
Good to see you again, friend. Any luck finding my goods?
I just moved here. I'd be more comfortable if I saw more Orcs in this neighborhood.\n\nEverything here is so peaceful. It drives me crazy.
Just waiting for my ship to come in.
I can't believe it. Trelan and Iriana were finally on their way off this rock!
I don't care about war. I just want to live my life in peace.
That buffoon is still behind me, isn't he? I suppose as long as I don't make any sudden moves, I'll be fine. \n\nI just want to finish my ale in peace.
If you're looking for that bastard Jakarn, he's at the tavern with a Redguard girl.
It's a wonderful day for a sailing trip, isn't it, friend? Especially if it gets me off this rock before Bhosek chops off my head.
Every night, I pray to Arkay to kill me in my sleep. Every morning, I wake up, still here. I hate this place. There's nothing to do, everything's always dirty, and I'm dressed in rags. Someday I'm going to beat Octavimus to death with this broom.
Hungry?
Blade's edge, we're setting sail with the famous Jakarn!\n\nElethien and I have a bet on who's going to bed him first.
My darling son's gone off on some fool errand. I hope he returns in one piece.
Don't bother Grubulash. She's obsessed when researching.
Leave me to my drink, stranger. If I can't remember what matters, might as well forget it all.
Ask anyone. If you want the best, you need to make it yourself.
<The captain doesn't seem to notice you. He's staring intently at something behind you.>
Hello there! Are you enjoying the festival?
There you are, Vestige. We must speak at once.
Greedy, ignorant, ugly, son of a mammoth's ass! That Diel can go leap in the river.
Welcome! What will you have?
I do hope you have both the thief and the egg with you. For everyone's sake.
Step back and wait your turn!
Good to meet you here, where the river runs to the sea.\n\nCan I get you something from guild stores?
Who's this, now? I bet you've got a wild tale or two to share.
You don't look wounded. What do you need?
Greetings, traveler! Blessings of Arkay upon you.
Did you see the way that one looked at me? They all look at me like that.\n\nDo you think it's the tusks?
The king, Ruptga's blessings be upon him, invites all his kinsmen to enjoy this garden.  \n\nWe need such tranquility in troubled times, is it not so?
This is not good. This is not good at all. These trees are unfamiliar. And there are spriggans and lurchers everywhere.
This one welcomes you to this humble Fighters Guild hall.
Just between you and me, my husband Beaubel and I are making a killing off these grunts.
Trouble in the woods? Send the Wood Elf. He can deal with it. Bah!\n\nWhy do people think all Bosmer have an affinity for nature? That's like saying all Nords love mead. Oh. Wait a moment ….
We're so busy because of the King's festival! It's almost enough to make me forget how terribly I miss Betra. Almost!
The Mages Guild is fortunate indeed! This Eyevea … the perfect place to practice spellwork and sell my leatherwork!
Heavy bags weigh down even the greatest Arch-Mage. Allow me to lighten your load?
You kept your head and did very well, my friend. The Fighters Guild owes you a debt.  \n\nBefore you go, you should take that crystal over there. I'm no scholar, but I bet it's a Light of Meridia. That's probably why Ifriz kept it behind the barrier.
Rum. Nothing but rum.\n\nWho do I have to gut for a flagon of wine around here?
These Redguards are slow to reopen their shops. Halinad is not slow, and has much to sell. Please look.
Shor's bones! Look what the jackals dragged in! Ha! I'm just yanking your helmet-horns. What'll you have?
Greetings! I sell the finest garments from Alik'r and beyond. You'll need a fresh tunic if you're heading off into the dunes.
Swords aloft, warriors! With the blessings of Onsi's bright blade, the Covenant banner marches forward. Are you ready to make war upon the enemies of the Alik'r?
Curse those Arbordawn idiots! I'll be bald for life!
Another traveler, by the looks of you. If you're heading north, you may want to explore the Sancre Tor ruins. It's a major historical site; many former emperors are buried there.\n\nI couldn't get close—too many undead. But you might.
Only in Bergama would the honored warriors of the Covenant be forced to train in a goat sty such as this. Accursed Crowns. I hope my writ of transfer comes soon.
Being an Orc in Bergama is miserable. Getting charity out of a Crown is like squeezing ale out of a skeever's arse.
Keep some distance from the beast. It is only my long exposure to it that allows me to tolerate the smell.
This is my favorite spot in the priory. Nature's beauty is spread before me, yet I can feel the warmth of Akatosh's presence at my back.
I'm afraid this one is about to die. I didn't realize how frail Bosmer were.
You … you cut my bindings?\n\nYou're not one of them, are you? I can tell. Please, get me out of here!
Everything we saw out there … it was maddening.\n\nThere's no way we can win this. There's just no way.
The Mages Guild and Fighters Guild, working together! I never thought I'd see the day!\n\nBut with you helping us, I'm sure that everything with turn out fine.
I'm curious to examine this plan that Vanus has come up with.
There is… an island. There is an island out there. I can feel it reaching. I can almost touch it.
Isn't <<1>> wonderful? He's been to every port between here and <<2>>!
If the beetles rush us, I will give my life to buy a few moments for the others to escape. \n\nMy son died in the fields, and I hold no fear in my heart at the thought that I might join him.
I have played in these fields since I was a child! I will not simply walk away!
The Fighters Guild is watching the situation here is Deshaan very closely.
I cannot lose him too. Elethlin is all I have left, but I fear he will leave me soon.
I am thinking you need more bags. Easier to hide things, yes?
Why, it's you. We do seem to meet in the strangest places.
<This Wood Orc's neck was snapped with incredible force. A blood trail leads off the edge of the cliff, and huge claw marks are gouged in the rock. It appears something tumbled off.>
I can't believe they dragged me out into the middle of nowhere. It's cold and wet and all my books are ruined!
I'm almost sorry to be stuck inside these walls. I'd love to get out there and get into the thick of the battle!
Finally, I can just relax in a nice, warm room. A glass of fine wine in my hand.\n\nI think I'll draw a nice hot bath to soothe my weary body. I just wish I had a servant or two to deal with these mundane tasks.
It's like stepping into the past. We're walking around in a piece of history! Look at the architecture!
Irrki's heart beats with a thousand sorrows! But if you wish to purchase a sword, this one will show you what she has.
Valenwood is a trove of rare ingredients.
The best woodcraft is both strong and flexible. Just like me, yes? Ha!
Mead from meat, wine from grapes … by the end of the night it all tastes the same.
Keep an eye peeled; this wood is full of the remnants of the Ayleid civilization.
Hmm? Oh, excuse me. I lost a bit of time for my studies with the Daedra and all.\n\nIt's imperative I show my family I deserve to leave this dump and return to Auridon. So, I hone my magics constantly. I'm sure you'll understand, I am, thus, busy.
My poor brother Thragaer. He's really looking for them.
Even for a well-traveled denizen of the planes such as myself, this place is way beyond my comfort level. I fear it won't get any easier from here on in.
Welcome to the Mages Guild enclave.
Another one who likes to stand around and watch work being done, eh? Well, this statue's not going to carve itself.
Even the fish here are foolish. No southern fish would bite at hooks in this cold. They would be sensibly buried in the mud, waiting for the weather to become liveable.
Looks like the previous owner took a fall off the rocks in back. Bad luck for him, good luck for me. This place is mine now; go find your own.
<This man is wearing the uniform of a Mages Guild acolyte. His face is contorted in fear and pain. However he died, it was sudden and unpleasant.>
And how can I help you, warrior?
Huh. Another soldier. You here to break things or buy something?
Fear no blade or arrow in my armor!
Fur in your food is just an added bonus, friend.
If it were up to me, I'd toss those mercenaries out of camp. They're nothing but spies who'll sell out to the highest bidder.
Enough. Enough! I'm ending this story now.
Those Reachmen—by St. Pelin's sacrifice, they're inhuman. I saw their faces beneath the rotten leathers. Black eyes … like a troll's eyes. Gods help us.
Don't suppose you saw a loose squirrel foot around here …?
Peer review and cooperative research is the root of all arcane development.\n\nThe Psijics formed for just such a purpose, did you know that? And from them came we, the Mages Guild.
This one makes soup. Tasty, fills your belly, keeps the plague away.
Hrmph. Not much left in stock, but if you see something you want, just let me know.
You can buy in Redfur. Or you can buy from me, to save some coin.
Thank you for helping Verandis. For helping me.\n\nIf it hadn't been for you, well, I … I don't want to think about it.
You want supplies? I have supplies. Fresh down the river today.
I can tell you're smarter than most of the unwashed masses that pass by our stall. Try my armor … special, just for you!
Arms for the war effort? I give you a special price. I wouldn't want you to think I profit from misfortune.
Frost trolls, in <<1>>? The world has gone mad.
There's no steel better than Orc steel. What more do you need to know?
Got sturdy shields and long-range weapons. Safety first, right?
You look a little dry, stranger. What can I get you?
The squalls haven't been kind so my stock's a little thin. But what I've got is fresh as milk and roses!
We boast a unique Mages Guild hall, nestled here in the great tree.
My wife told me that I need to move more product, so I took the shields out of a crate and put them in a barrel. I don't know how that's supposed to help our business, but she's always been the brains in the family.
I'm rather enjoying my stay in Fort Amol. Not every town I bring my wares to is so accommodating. Deldwine's Inn is very nice and there are lots of friendly soldiers.
Every port needs a gifted woodworker—especially if it's a proper naval yard. There's always work to be done, so let's make this quick, eh?
The city may fall, but the goblets must be saved. So says Shada.\n\nThe Yokudans will destroy everything if they gain this power.
Fresh flavors! Exotic spices! A queen's bounty of flavor for the discerning cook! Come, have a look!
Do you see something you like?
Well, well, well, look what the Khajiit dragged in. What do you need?
If I may be of assistance, do let me know. Otherwise, I shall be occupying myself with my own duties here.
Kelmen believes there is a fourth Atronach roaming Craglorn. Could this one have been created by the Serpent?
How did I fail to see this coming? It was my responsibility to protect them. The city was my responsibility.
This one has many accounts to settle before the Moons rise and fall. What do you need?
Fascinating creatures. Such uncomplicated lives. Kill or be killed. Consume or be consumed.
Thanks for the delivery.
I thought things would improve as the city neared completion, but what do we get? Rude and impatient hooligans running hither and yon!\n\nThis is why we can't have nice things. I hope a guard beats his head in.
There's a lot of uncertainty in Belkarth these days, but you can rest assured we'll take good care of your valuables here.
The water. Don't drink the water.\n\nIt turns your mind. The Nereids will control you. Shada will control you. She made us take Nahlia.
I can't believe Klause and the others would have done this. This is all because of the water?
It's strange, all these people pouring into Belkarth. We used to be such a quiet town. \n\nWell, maybe not quiet. Just anonymous.
You're not a Stone-Fish. State your business or move along, if you please.
I've had a lot of time to reflect on my actions in Shimmerene. To truly see how I let my prejudice blind me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still not pleased that we've opened our borders. But if my home is changing, then so must I.

The Lieutenant is dead. He died protecting Velyn Harbor and its militia.

In the heart of The Rift, just outside the lively, small town of Nimalten, you will find this sturdy wooden home, with a large hearth to keep you warm in the Skyrim winter, and a stone wall to keep out the trolls.
By tradition, the biggest mansion on the south side of Riften is always called Mistveil Manor. Since the death of old Thane Snelgar, the current Mistveil Estate has come available, including its impressive stone mansion with attached stable.
This charming abode was named after both the Prophet Veloth who founded the surrounding town of Narsis, and the Velothi Mountains that rise above the walled garden at its rear.
It may be small but it's solid, and it keeps the sandstorms out. The scenery is magnificent, but if you're in the mood for civilization, it's right outside the south gate of Hallin's Stand.
Stay moist in an underwater Xanmeer Manor with its own submerged picture windows! Gaze into the depths of a lush Murkmire lake from the sunken interior of this capacious Argonian edifice, where comfort mixes casually with the bizarre. Xuth!
Pit Fighting promoter Crottus "Thumbs-Down" Lycus built this private arena atop the haunted ruins of Molavar because the land was cheap, and what could go wrong? He vanished mysteriously some time ago, and now his unique Arena Home is back on the market.
By some miracle or simple chance, Lucky Cat Landing weathered the fires that ravaged Southern Elsweyr completely unsinged! Its spacious terrace frames a gorgeous view, and its proximity to Senchal makes it convenient for those who enjoy city living.

Did you hear some cultists found an old Daedric shrine in Fungal Grotto? Killed all the Dreugh just to get at it.
So you exposed Danus' little cannibal caravan, did you? Makes me sick to my gut just thinking about it.
I heard that someone entered the Black Forge and shut it down. That should slow down the Dark Lord's plans!
Lady Laurent sends her regards -- she still has that insufferable Stibbons with her.
Rumor is that Count Ravenwatch found something important in the Lorkrata Hills. Was it a weapon, maybe? Or an ancient artifact of incredible power?
High King Emeric's truly blessed. He's survived another attempt on his life!
I heard you convinced Martin Dathieu to enlist in the guard. I hope he's half the soldier his father was.
Did you hear? The entire wedding party vanished! But the groom and some stranger rescued them all from Oblivion!
I was relieved to hear that Voljar's Meadery has reopened. Good mead warms the soul!
You stood against the Daedra in Dune. Bright moons be praised!
I heard what happened at Moonmont, Hallowed. Moons be praised for your bravery.
The official word is that Vicereeve Pelidil used Prince Naemon for his own evil ends.
Don't believe the rumors. Prince Naemon died protecting the queen in the Orrery.
I hear you helped drive the damned Imperials out of Satakalaam. Long live the Covenant!
Someone told me that Gloria Fausta gave her life to cure Duke Sebastien of the werewolf's curse.
Did you hear? Someone stole Queen Nurnhilde's body from the Royal Tombs.
I heard someone gave Fildgor a warrior's death. Was that you?
Have you heard that King Lalorian has returned? He's going to lead the Fighters Guild now.
I heard you were there when Molag Grunda was defeated. Well done.
Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!
I hear you resolved the standoff at Alcaire Castle. I am glad no blood was shed.
Those witches helped at the Mill? That really surprises me.
I heard that Duke Sebastien was ill, but Gloria Fausta cured him. Royalty have all the luck!
Don't know why the Ashlanders attacked a holy order, but at least someone stopped them.
This one is not sure what to think about a Redguard leading the Fighters Guild. Strange times we live in.
I presume it was quick for the Silvernar's advisor, in the end. You have my sympathies.
Now that the giant threat is over, I'm going to start trading in Lower Yorgrim again.
Folks are saying that Count Ravenwatch discovered an Ayleid manuscript in the Lorkrata ruins. Good thing you were there to help him!
That Argonian traitor should have been put to the blade. Guildmaster at-Aswala is kinder than I'd have been!

It is unfortunate you must die.  The Throne has use for such sly agents.  Guards!
My parents? I... I have none. I live at our camp, with the other children. Mother Murk gives us everything we need. Wanna see?
You must mean Claude. He's out there, day and night, trying to tell the spirits something about his grandfather or something. If you ask me, he's not quite all there.
gra-Muzgob? During my time at the chapel, I ran her off a time or two. Orc witch, if I remember. Had a thing for dead bodies.\n\nThought she was dead. Probably wouldn't stop her. Her old house is south of here. Maybe you'll find something there.
Elsie cured my son of chills once.
The Lion Guard won't abide any witch.\n\nBut the Wyrd and Roch?  That story's more personal.  They took his son, you see.  No man can forgive that.
I gave the weapon to a second courier.  Her name is Katarin.  She took it to Aldcroft in Urvaius...\n\nI just wanted to return to my home in Glenumbra...
But sir... it's all I've ever wanted to do. You may be right, but... I'm not giving up. Next time I see a zombie, I'm hacking it to bits! Sir.
You want the sword too? Cursed thing! I don't have it anymore - it was bound for Aldcroft up north, so I gave it over to Katarin, a courier bound that way. Gods, I hope the Magis aren't after her too! Can you find her? \n\nBack to Glenumbra for me!
Thank you.
What do you want?  I have a long, grueling trial ahead of me, I cannot afford distraction.
But... you don't understand. She doesn't allow us to leave. The wolves will tear us to bits.
Collect three hearts of the spriggans that guard the Wyrd camp, and also some of the local Worm's Head Mushrooms.\n\nTake this catalyst, and put them in it.\n\nThen use the resulting potion on their tree.
Fine, help Eliana if you wish! I'll hire hunters to chase him down myself!
How can you say that? Virolynn's life is more important than revenge!
There is a ravine, an ancient alcove, cut into the earth, in the forest northeast of here. The ritual is taking place there. I will mark your map with its location.
Inquisitor Roche's men took the Howling Pipe from a sister of the Wyrd they... apprehended.\n\nYou can get close to him. We cannot. Take this powder and throw it in his face. It should stun him long enough for you to get the pipe back.
Those thieving little Murklings are known to do more than just steal. They aren't above cutting your throat should they catch you unawares.
The Magis are battlemages, defenders of Northmoor. They say they're our protectors, hunting hidden evils. They've become a legion of thugs, oppressing common folk at the slightest suspicion. Of course, to speak against them is proof of wrongdoing!
We Bretons have always fought. Daggerfall, Wayrest, Evermor-- we've shed all their blood, and them ours. Why, I can remember the last war agaisnt Shornhelm. Now we're sure to have another. May Stendarr's mercy be upon us all.
Close one, that. If you'd not arrived to warn us when you did, we'd all have been caught with our pants down. Can't say I'd raise a mug to Averos, but his choice in spies and messengers is beyond reproach. Head back and let Averos know we won.
It's the Chalice of Gwedrun you want? No one in Camlorn can be trusted, and I'll not part with it easily. Prove yourself to me by helping the Lion Guard with their patrols or by clearing the ruins of some troublesome wraiths, and I'll consider it.
Angof, no. I don't know the name.
The pack leader. He's responsible for the death of Camlorn. The spit dries in my mouth just saying his name.
I don't know about them running off, but one of those wee miscreants broke into my forge and stole tools and wrecked the place.  The children in this town act like none should, I tell you.
Once it was a beautiful landmark, something Bretons could be proud of.\n\nNow it's just like everything else here: ruined and overrun with undead horrors.\n\nIt's the high cemetery, you know! Very impressive.
The mines? Rabinna would never go there. It's much too dangerous.\n\nThis one fears for the safety of the miners.
There was a cave-in there last year, during the Second Seed.  \n\nMany miners perished. Now the place is thick with undead.\n\nI don't want to see their faces again.
There are those here who won't even speak his name out loud.\n\nThey're afraid he'll hear them.\n\nI'll say no more about the matter.
Our troops marched through Wrothgar on our way here. I saw his handiwork as we passed Cath Bedraud.\n\nHe has no tactics or strategy. He wants to poison everything here, scheming until all of Glenumbra has been corrupted.\n\nThat seems to be working.
To the west on the shore, a fool and his servant brave the harpies to catch fish.  Fish!  He should hope someone saves him, before the hunter becomes the prey, and well deserved!
They wished to destroy our blessed Crystal Tower. However the arrogant Maormer underestimated the power of the mages there, who were able to destroy the ship just short of its intended target.
This is the first conversation widget
Because the Beacon drove the Discarnates Rogue, which makes it permissible to slay them and harvest their Daedric Soul Gems. Why else?
Wow.... You really are an idiot
I knew it! Go get him!
Uhn... the altar's true name? It's... jakay-jhe. Speak that to banish the altar and its spell.\n\nThat's all I know. Please, don't hurt me anymore.
I know about Dabienne, but I've had no luck freeing her. The townspeople are agitated. If you know some way to free her, I'd welcome your help.\n\nConstable Sal's at the center of town. Convince him to release her, and I'll make sure she's protected.
Good to hear
It was full of water just a few days ago. Now, nothing but mud and dust!\n\nIt must be a curse! My father says it's the vampires, that they've brought a curse down on the entire kingdom!
He was, but there isn't much call for his services of late. Me? I take care of the miller's children every morning and then clean noble manors all afternoon.\n\nI'm wiped out!
He's a good son, but I fear he might try to avenge me for the insult of the … incident.
I'm a cattle wrangler. I ride around these parts, watching people's herds. I've been working for the Edralds for most of the last few years. \n\nI just came up here to track down a few bulls that had managed to wander off.
They say pirates killed the lighthouse keeper to keep the light from ever being relit. Who knows what horrors go on in the dark now?
You would have me disobey direct orders and turn against Sir Croix? You sound like that coward Sir Edmund.\n\nYou are an enemy to the order, and I will see you slain.
No. The cave has been opened recently by graverobbers seeking the wealth of the Four. They meet an untimely end I am afraid, and end up serving the Four...
Many methods exist to make them, but Breton fireworks are the best!\n\nMages lock magical power inside granular sand, then, imbed those vials inside flying sticks of wood. After launching, they explode in midair, creating a marvel of color and sound!
I'm not telling you anything.  Stop interfering, I'm warning you!
I saw the legions of Akaviri on our shores.\n\nThey came to destroy us and take the survivors as slaves to their far-off shores.\n\nThe flood came soon after. I did not survive, but I must know: were the Akaviri successful?
The Dres Ordinator came... they took my betrothed!  All of the papers and evidence she had built against House Dres... everything!\n\nPlease, you must help.  Find out where they took her.  I know you were helping her; promise me you'll do something!
Now what would you like to do?
My beloved died of his wounds from the attack on Camlorn. He wanted his ashes scattered at this bridge. \n\nI was attacked by wolves. I can't make it.\n\nPlease, help me honor my beloved's last request. Take Andre's ashes to the bridge and scatter them.
Now you threaten me?  Go!  Harass someone else!
The Ordinator Vusara fdevised the ritual to mitigate Akaviri's curse on these lands. \n\nIf the ritual isn't performed, thousands of Akaviri undead will arise.\n\nThey'll march across the lands of the living again.
What? Oh, my tea... of course, I'd forgotten what time it was.\n\nI suppose hiring my servant to kill me would be far too obvious. Well, it looks like I've survived another day!
If you could destroy some of those shadows and stop their leader, a creature called Veddergen, we could clear up the rest. Thin out their numbers, then speak to Commander Viskel, just beyond the gardens. He could use the help.
One of the witches has gone missing. Some are saying those cultists hauled her into a cave.
We were just standing here talking. He said you went in to talk to the countess, so we were waiting ….\n\nThen all of the sudden an arrow flew out of nowhere right into his chest. He was dead before he hit the ground.
Excellent! We need all the help we can get. \n\nThe ogre attacks have been relentless. Get ready for battle. We can expect an attack any minute now.
We need to free the sick captives. If you've heard any rumors about missing people or kidnappings, I've learned they are all true. They have several up there. Free them and then return to me.
A bunch of zombies have risen up, and are attacking anyone who comes near.  The patrol's been too busy to send anyone out to take care of them.  Perhaps you could help out and deal with them?
Whoever you are, I'm going to make sure you're well-rewarded for this.
It does. And by Maouloch, we need you! The ogres are about to make another big push, and I can only spare so many soldiers.\n\nWill you join Murtag clan in battle? We need you out on the battlefield right away.
Here is your ticket. You may enter the arena!
You are more intelligent than you appear.  A few days ago the guards brought a man and a woman in.  The man was bloodied and beaten.  The woman they took over to the Inn.  I hear she is getting quite the attention. She goes by the name Valoria.
There's lot of work to be done.  leave me be for now.
Oh? So you're going to kill me? Because … I don't have the money. Nothing to be done for it. I'm not going to run though. I'm a man of integrity, at least in this case. \n\nYou don't think S'rashi could give me a few more weeks?
Yes, it must have slipped from your pack. Luckily for you, I found it. \n\nI thought you might come back to look for it. Try not to lose it next time!
A swordsinger forges a shehai through training, meditation, and devotion.\n\nShehai are rare. Even Master Ahtah has not created one.
Dabienne is innocent. They did it. They did! My family is under attack. And my wife... my wife....\n\nThe constable won't believe me. \n\nHe won't listen to my daughter Ganise. She was always over at the Vanne's farm. She saw things, but he won't listen!
Not long after you left, an army of Daedra attacked us!
You stopped them from completing a summoning ritual.\n\nIf the Supernal Dreamers had been successful, they would have sent a Daedra to destroy Alcaire Castle.\n\nThis is the second time their cult has tried to summon a Daedra!
I'm afraid now is not a good time. Though we celebrate his return, Sir Hughes seems to have fallen ill. \n\nHe came into the keep a short time ago, muttering to himself about Duchess Lakana.
When one meddles in such dark practices, anything is possible.\n\nI suggest you proceed with care and make sure to enact the ritual properly.
Are you mad? Look at me! No armor. No weapons. The Imperials have blades, arrows, mages, and dogs.\n\nDo you know what they do to conspirators? Death would be a mercy. I don't like the Imperials, but I'm no fighter. Ask someone else, stranger.
You tried. Thank you. It's too late.\n\nThe Supernal Dreamers finished their ritual. The Omen is already here. It wants... in.\n\nDurak taught me to resist daedra. I can keep it out of me, but not for long.\n\nYou must kill me. Rob the Omen of its host.
If they possessed a grand soul, would they be here sucking up skooma and drooling on themselves?\n\nAs I said, they can't be blamed. They were born with less. We must expect no more of them … no more than we would from a guar, I'd say.
You have a five? Lucky. \n\nYou win... congrats, I guess.
Thank you! I feel a bit better already.\n\nJust give me a minute to catch my breath.\n\nYou have to save my mother before it's too late!
Excellent! I feel it working already.
I got one of them drunk and asked him about Daedra. He said they're terribly powerful beings, capable of anything. So I stole his map and told <<1>> this site was rich with Dwarven gold.\n\nI was a fool. He'll never trust me again after this.
The gods!\n\nWhile the rest of the world hatches, they wait. While the rest of the world is consumed, they wait.
I will light the incense and voice the petition. But first, I will coat my blade in the juice of the nightshade.\n\nWith it, you must stab the assembled corpse, as I speak the petition.
"For what does man know of the endless space of Time? \n\n"We know naught but what our meager eyes may show us, or perhaps only what our feeble minds may engender."
Those worthless curs kidnapped me with a shipment of fine art from <<1)>>. They took my art and were going to ransom me back to my family in Wayrest, but I managed to escape. \n\nOn top of it all, they... soiled... some of the paintings.
" … and later suffered under, their kingdom of vice. And long was her reign, and fruitful, for the Empress and her northern allies made good upon their union, and prosperity flowered in abundance."
<You've reached the final page.>\n\n"This brings us to the Dragon Break, which will be fully examined in my next manuscript, entitled Time, Towers, and the Staff of Chaos.\n\n-- Reginnus Vertantian, Historian of Hillborne"
I don't mean anything by it.\n\nIt's just, the count is different since he met that woman. But I don't ask questions. I suggest you don't either.
I don't mean anything by it.\n\nIt's just, the count is different since he met that woman. But I don't ask questions. I suggest you don't either.
Oh! Well then, I suppose you're an old friend of the countess's… I don't want to pry of course.\n\nBut, well, I am curious. What exactly is your relationship with her?
Well, I mean, I was curious, so, yes, I followed him. He hiked up into the woods north of town.\n\nKind of peculiar, honestly. So, can you tell me what this is all about? I'm dying to know.
Not much. For a knight, he sure doesn't know much about horses. \n\nAnd I've heard him talk a lot about honor, but he's not exactly out there slaying monsters and rescuing princesses, is he? Too busy begging the countess to marry him.
Where did you get those? Those are mine!\n\nNone may touch those save for me. That blade, that hilt, that pommel … to hold them again. Please, give them to me.
Smart and perceptive. I suppose this could be of use to you. There should be monuments in the ruins.\n\nHold this holy symbol and pray at any of the monuments and it should summon a fallen hero to fight at your side.
<This chest contains a myriad of noblewomen's clothing stained with what looks like dried blood.\n\n<You take along one of the blouses in case it has anything to do with Leila's death.>
No. Please. I'll tell you. Not like it's a really important secret or anything. Sir Hughes just takes himself a little too seriously.\n\nThe message was just that Dame Dabienne of the Knights of the Flame was coming to help with security.
Though my mind may not recall the favor you have done for me, my spirit will. And the river … the river never forgets.\n\nThis charm will keep me close. If we are parted, use it and I will come. When our task is done, tell <<1>> of my fate.
After the attempt on her life, that makes sense, but why go to her father? The Knights of the Flame are here to protect her. \n\nThat makes no sense. Why would he send an army here? The assassin's poison came from Alik'r—the duchess said so herself.
Clan Murtag offered us a choice. They left well-trained soldiers in our village to guard the Bretons. If we don't help them against the ogres, our families will pay.\n\nWe fight for the Orcs here to keep our children safe there.
Ha! They're as nervous as mares, startling over the littlest thing.\n\nTell Father that I'm fine. These ruins have sheltered me for more than a day, and I've fended off several cats myself. Soon, they'll all be gone.
I've never seen Arnoit Sidrey or his wife, but you're not the first to speak of him. It's an old tale. Him finding travelers, begging them to help.\n\nYou know what? No one even remembers his wife's name. She supposedly died here, in Ranser's war.
Good guess. Take this Midnight Union sigil with you. The guards will see it and let you pass unharmed.
It's a pity, but I can't trust anyone under his sway. They must die.\n\nGo to the mews and ensure they do not escape alive. I will have <<1>> meet you there.
We were sent to Shornhelm to assist House Tamrith against House Montclair. House Montclair must have known we were on the way. \n\nThey set up the perfect trap for us. They blocked our advance while using a pincer maneuver to cut off our retreat.
<This man has deep knife wounds on his back and sides. A viscous green ichor cakes the edges of the wounds.>
Look, I don't want any trouble. That's a phrase used by the King's intelligence network. It means someone's going to get killed. \n\nI don't want to know anything more. Just leave me out of this.
The rest of our soldiers went ahead to establish a camp at the <<1>>. I'll hobble my way there while you take care of the signal.\n\nMeet me there. May Kynareth exalt you over your enemies.
Dead? Rugged fellow, had a dog? That's Roy. Well, that was Roy. I'm sorry he's dead, but I'm not surprised. \n\nIf you figure out what Roy knew and who killed him, I'm sure someone will reward you. It's also a good way to get yourself killed.
Very good. I'll return to Aldcroft.\n\nMeet me there after you rescue this mysterious woman.
I sell the best fruits and vegetables in Daggerfall. Lots of people come by. I talk and I listen. Then I talk to my friends, like Roy.\n\nAs for other people? Maybe they should decide what they're going to do, now that they know so much.
With you? Yes, of course. But, please, keep your voice down.\n\nNo need to alarm anyone unnecessarily.
Someone brave and rash enough has to actually step through the door we opened. \n\nI'm too valuable to get lost in the past. And Bhagrun would probably change history with all his usual bumbling about. Ask Grahla what she thinks we should do.
That would help a lot. Bring them to Muriel at her shop as soon as you can. \n\nAnd Captain? Be careful out there.
I was with Wizard Benele at the nearby Merovec's Folly, looking for an important relic. \n\nWhen the undead attacked us, we were forced to retreat. But the mage swore she was close to finding something. She did some magic thing and vanished.
Good question. But how should I know? I'm just a former Lion Guard who decided to join the Wyrd. \n\nThe tree keeps me safe. That's good enough for me.
Gautier's retaken the camp? You must have led quite a charge. \n\nTell him I have almost a full company of soldiers in here. And we're ready to fight.
We're nomads who follow the ways of the Ansei. Redguard society shuns us because we do what they won't do: we strike down the undead. To them, we're honorless animals.\n\nThat doesn't matter. They need us, and they know it.
King Fahara'jad supported us, but quietly. He couldn't do so openly, as tradition says it's dishonorable to harm the dead, even when they're at your gates.\n\nWe defeated the army, and Marimah killed Suturah. I used to think the story ended there.
Our lordship defends Daggerfall. He will not let our proud history be forgotten. \n\nWe may be part of the Covenant, but it was he who insisted the Knights of the Dragon be maintained as a separate entity.
We train the ways of the ready sword and the sharp mind. Our martial tradition dates to the time of the Ra Gada, by Leki's blessed blade.\n\nEven if you never plan to wield a sword, you'll face one in battle. Here, you'll learn to survive.
Students prove themselves through the art of battle. Any fool can win a duel, but a master knows who will challenge her, and where it will occur.\n\nYou must think as the masters did. Learn not just how they fought, but when, and why.
<<1>> was an initiate, yet he faced the mage and won. So handily, in fact, that his opponent made apologies and left, forever shamed.\n\nOf all the students who faced the mage, <<1>> was far from the best warrior. How did <<1>> win the duel?
You … you were the one who came to the door? Who my father sent off to get weapons for us? He should have trusted you.
<This backpack contains three items that seem appropriate: an old cup, a glass bottle full of water, and a wooden ladle.>
I suppose you should know the truth. Ancient inscriptions here described some unique alchemical processes, which I tried to duplicate. \n\nI fear I succeeded all too well, and Stibbons' unfortunate condition is the result.
The wolf's woe grows all around here, so it should be easy to acquire.\n\nAs for the key, grab a Red Rook uniform and look around. The disguise should fool the bandits, but watch out for the wolves. Otherwise, shake a few bandits until a key falls out.
If you can fight, and you know the difference between a man's head and a wolf's arse, we can use you. \n\nWe need to cut through the werewolves and link up with our troops in the western end of the camp.
Good. Meet me at the center of the graveyard. \n\nWhen Angof notices what I'm doing, he's bound to send someone to stop me. If they interrupt me while I'm casting, the spell will fail. And that won't be good.
My best guess? Deeper inside the catacombs. \n\nIf you find any knights, send them this way. I'll hold the passage with this overconfident fool and his crazy friend. When they aren't flirting, they both fight like a whole platoon of Orcs.
After each trap fires, there's a brief moment when you can disarm it. \n\nDuring this moment you have to defeat its guardian. It's the only way.
Yah. I'll be fine. Here. Take my lucky thingamabob.\n\nThose guys kept talking about Bonerender.
The fight for Balfiera is more than just capturing the Fort at the center! There are many other aspects to war on this small slab of rock.
Battle Tasks are always running because the fight is always changing! Be on the lookout for flags that mark key locations to capture every fifteen to twenty minutes!
Gallants. Horse-warriors. The Breton call us knights, but we don't fight like their knights. We wear leathers, turn quickly, fire our bows from the saddle. The wear steel and wield steel. Their horses can only move quickly in a straight line.
Yes, I think so. \n\nBut what about Cecile? She was ahead of us and I saw her get captured. They took her toward their camp on the beach. We can't leave without her.
That's an odd question. I've known the duchess since we were children. We grew up together.\n\nNow she's dead. Nothing will ever fill the hole in my heart.\n\nI'll take some comfort in seeing her here at home with her family. It's where she needs to be.
Excellent! I knew you would come through for me! \n\nThis is good. Very good. Now there's really nothing the Primeval Seekers can do to stop us.
You have a gift for understatement, friend.  You are welcome to shelter here. The shipyards are no place for a Baandari right now, nor for you, if you want my advice.
All right, novice. If you're going to make it in the Smith's guild, you're going to have to start with the simple stuff. \n\nDon't worry. We all started with the simple stuff. Hah.
Great another lackwit who thinks that can find treasures in the mangy fur of a dead wolf.\n\nWell if you must …  Do you swear to follow the guidance and strictures of the honorable guild of outfitters?
First you have to promise to help me. I didn't stumble into a Lion Guard camp by accident. I came here for help, not to be taken prisoner!\n\nI had no choice! They're holding my family!
Quiet! The bad one will taste your words on the air.\n\nHe's coming closer. Bloodfiends accompany him … so many bloodfiends …. They want our blood!
No, they're not, but it's the best advice I can give you. \n\nAlso, the Imperials desecrated our town with their skeletal soldiers. If you pass too close to one, they'll attack you. The dead show no mercy to the living.
Let's get moving.
<The inset is empty.>
I'm not sure, but the lieutenant thinks the Montclairs are responsible.\n\nIf any of the Hinaults were killed, you have to burn their bodies. Take this torch and start with Gennove. Then collect his ashes so his family can give him a proper burial.
Here. Take this key and use it to enter Governor Seius' mansion.\n\nI want to stay among my people, so I can remain as an inspiration for them. I wish you the best of luck.
I can teleport you there for a small fee.\n\nForgive me for asking for coin. The reagents for our spells are costly.\n\nLet me know when you're ready, and I'll begin the spell.
You've never heard of Ahknara? They call her the Poison of Alik'r. She's an infamous assassin. They say she cut down an entire Dominion army in one night.\n\nWhatever she's planning, it's big.
Enslaving the dead is evil. Furon does not understand this. As for Giron, I think he does not care.\n\nThere is a better way.
The Dunmer don't trust Argonians, especially me and my egg sister, <<1>>. They fear we'll harm them.\n\nYou are a stranger, so they may let you heal their wounds.
A signal. It's colorful, but harmless.\n\nIf you find Lady <<1>>, use it, and I will come to you.
Of course he is, the overprotective guar. Since we lost Mother he's tried to run my life for me. \n\nI think I'll need two bottles of sujamma when I get home. Forget what Father says.
It's where you get kwama eggs.\n\nYou can also get kwama cuttle, the waxy substance that grows on their beaks.
It was before the signing of the Pact. The Argonians of Senie still served my neighbors as slaves. Several of them made a break for freedom, and … my Rainisi … she was just out for a stroll.\n\nAhem. But today Morvani lives. Thanks to you.
Only that you need to bring it. I tried to reason with my ancestors, but they do not understand our peril.\n\nYou must succeed where I cannot.
Assassins! Captain Llaari should see this. She's in the command post, the largest building in the fort. \n\nReport to her, and I'll spread the word to the other troops in the fort. We need everyone on guard and watching their backs.
I'll make a run for it. \n\nPlease, find my brother Mevis. He may be a pain, but I don't want him ending up spitted on some Orc's sword.
Please, find my family.\n\nI'm going to make a run for it. Wish me luck.
Kill the Daedra at the nearby ruins. Take what we need from them.
Good. Kill wounded soldiers to gather the Spirits of Strife and slay fire atronachs to gather the Spirits of Fire.\n\nThen return to me, and we will end this war.
The Three bless you.\n\nMother? Everything's going to be fine now.
I wouldn't worry about it. I whipped him for messing up our shipments and he's probably off sulking.\n\nThe boy claims it wasn't his fault that we received the wrong crates. Like I believe that! He needs to pay better attention.
You're a little like Eanen. He was always gentle and kind with me.\n\nNow to find him. I'll search the tombs to the southeast. Would you search to the west?
Every path leads in two directions: into light and into darkness. \n\nLight and dark. Good and evil. Sunlight and shadow. Two sides to all things, little warm-blood.
Some of our people heard a Dark Elf talking to others of his kind. He asked if they'd seen the Dres rowing out to our Hist Tree. He saw jars of poison in the boat.\n\nThat's not hard to believe.
Help? Is that what you're doing?\n\nListen. You didn't hear it from me. Star is a cat. She runs around in front of the kinhouse. Now go away and leave me be.
Ok I'll help.
Then the time has come. Take this whistle. When you're near the kinhouse, blow it. The sound will be our signal to create a distraction.
Use the distraction to enter the kinhouse. Head upstairs and search for a set of keys to the armory.\n\nBut don't dawdle. The guards won't leave their posts for long.
I never saw him before. I asked him for coin to get more skooma.\n\nHe was a Dunmer. Someone called him … Bravil? Weevil? Wabbajack? Rhavil! That's it.
Let's just say I'm well informed. I've suspected the connection for a while and his abduction of the councilor confirms it.\n\nMy associate and I tend to avoid situations not covered by our contracts. Still, we might be able to assist one another.
We were ambushed in the ruins. During the fighting, I slipped past the others and found the key to this building.\n\nOur missing people are here. Many are alive, but by the Three! What were they doing to the dead? It's horrifying!
So that's why he wanted Narsis sealed. He wanted easy access to more plague carriers.\n\nHouse Hlaalu will make sure no one drinks the water until the lake is cleansed.
Every small cog drives a greater gear. Each is necessary; otherwise, the whole collapses.\n\nWhen any cog shivers from the stresses on it, the Master feels it, but the load he assigns it is no more than he knows it can bear.
Well, that's a new one. \n\nI've been the General's bodyguard for nearly a decade. If I was plotting against him, I think I'd have made my move by now.
My. You are a charmer. Very well. Here is the key. When you finish with that oath, perhaps you will come back and visit. Here is my key. Use it to get what you need from the box behind me.
It's not up to me! General Gavryn made them enforcers. That gives them the authority to do whatever they want. If I so much as mention it, I'm as good as dead.\n\nSorry, but I'm not sticking my head through that particular noose.
That soothes like a soft rain in the night. Her death will remind these mammal-lickers who's in charge here.\n\nThen we will talk about your Dominion problem.
That's the spirit. Bring one for me.
I do! It's quite simple. Defeat any of these warriors in single combat to pass the Trial of the Fang.\n\nOh, and you must drink poison. Nothing permanent, just something to dull your senses.
I'm not above giving the Dres some payback for the damage they caused.\n\nI need to clean up out here—but I want that Omalor fetcher who ran inside. Feel like doing some hunting?
Open your recipe notebook, novice. As I said, I've already laid out the recipe in there for you. Just follow the recipe, and you should have polished hrotanda in no time!
What? After all we've been through?\n\nFine, fine. I'll deal with Sergeant Maril myself. If you can't say something helpful, just don't say anything at all.
What? Yes, of course I'm … wait. Blast it! You're with the caravan, aren't you?\n\nLook, I know when I'm backed into a corner. I'll tell you whatever you want to know. Just help me get out of here alive.
Always. A cliff overlooks their loaded wagons. And I've got archers up there. \n\nGet to Naryu Virian. Tell her to have the archers shatter the crates from above. We'll see how the Maulborn like being exposed to their own plague.
They're the lost souls of those who failed the Trial of the Ghost Snake.\n\nThey weren't able to kneel before the great Fang Spires and commune with the Spirit of the Vale.
<You have six gizzards to grind up with troll fat and wisplight powder.>
I've been here for weeks, playing the political games common to all Dark Elf kinhouses. I've decided I hate such games.\n\nBut you'd be surprised what you can learn if you just stand back and listen.
I've seen these symbols before. The Wood Elves sometimes write this way. Hmm.\n\nThis is a treasure map. I cannot read these notes, but I know someone who can.
Look in the mirror, scaleskin. He spoke out against you people, and rightly so!\n\nYour Shadowscales are to blame. We bring civilization to you cretins and you thank us with knives in the dark!
The Dreamers believe they found a way to alter reality with the power provided by the shattered crystal. I don't know if they're right, but I don't really want to find out. Just stop them!
"An uprising amongst the local foresters started a brief seven-day war that broke the knights' hold on the region. They were condemned to die in the very dungeons in which they tortured their unruly subjects."
I don't take orders from you, whoreson dog! You … you're absolutely right. I can't stay here. What was I thinking?\n\nI'm leaving and any Daedra that gets in my way goes straight to Oblivion! Because I'll kill them!
You have no right to judge me! My father left when I was five. I never had a positive male role model.\n\nLook. Just go away. I'm begging you.
If you wish to brave the Mirthless Order, that is your choice. Here's the second part of the performance: \n\n"In response, the morag of Koal Canton released their kwama …. "
The Magister was my mentor. I don't wish to talk about it right now. \n\nBut why do you care? What's the death of a guild mage to you?
Can you think of a better way to safeguard it?
Good. That's on the hill over there.\n\nI could use you in my future plans. See you soon.
I admire your strength. If I couldn't trust my father's wisdom, I'd feel lost. Where would I turn for counsel?\n\nI'm sorry. This isn't your concern.
We have to get out of here. I know a shortcut! But there's a big kwama in the way.\n\nIt went into that tunnel over there. If you poke its eggs, I bet it'll come out. Then we can run up the tunnel and escape!
Oh. My.\n\nDo you know what this is? It's an original edition of "The Art of Love and Swordplay" of the Nord poet Fjokki.
When we go to market, they spit on us and call us heretics. When we pass, they draw their children inside.\n\nIf our men are beaten or our women assaulted, the first question the Ordinators ask is, "What did you do to provoke this?"
You what, now? Look, some Dominion mogul came through here, a while back. "<<1>>," they called him.\n\nHe's the one who bound a Dremora and forced her to steal faces off the dead. You want to stop him? You must've been the only egg in your clutch.
An unfortunate, but not unexpected, turn of events.\n\nHopefully, this <<1>> has taken her last victim for a few generations.
I was blind … a desperate Mer, tricked by his loneliness.\n\nYou know, she must have loved me. She saved my life so many times … from Dominion spies, from things in these swamps. She … it must have really cared.
Magistrix Vox used Daedric magic to split the seams of the wards around the High Chapel. Then she opened an Oblivion gate to fill the Temple with Daedra.
You need to get into the High Chapel. Vox managed to bypass the defenses, but its wards are still in place, drawing on the full power of the Tribunal. \n\nWe must get you past those wards.
Some can stay isolated in the Vale or some may choose the outside world. Two sides of the same path. \n\nThe merchant's presence has already changed the Vale. What happens next is inevitable.
There was a decanter, somewhere in the temple below. Its water was holy. \n\nYou have seen the strange fires throughout town? I remember that much. Maybe this liquid can quench those flames.
A small blessing, my supplicant. You could smell their lies.\n\nNow, take my blade. See the world as it truly is.
I'll get these to Madras. No one will question why I have the weapons, since I'm a smith and all.\n\nGet back to the kinhouse and wait for us there. I'll be sure Madras sends someone to find you when we're ready.
Vox possesses my hammer, the Judgment. Like any such artifact, it can be used for good or turned to darker purposes.\n\nBut all is not lost. I can protect you from the hammer's powers.
I showed you Magistrix Vox's arrival and how she demanded we join her. Treason! We would not do it.\n\nWhen we refused, she decided to make an example of us. She used Saint Veloth's Judgment to tear a hole in Selfora.
Our meeting at Othrenis left me curious and frustratingly conscious. Can you really imprison Balreth?\n\nDeath has given me a certain … perspective. And, of course, I have time to indulge my curiosity.
Balreth's attacks have cost him power. You should defeat him while he's weak.\n\nRight now, I feel him moving in the caldera of the volcano, gathering strength from the lava flows there.
Not exactly, but then again, that's your side of this business, isn't it?\n\nMy only advice is to talk to the nightflowers at the inn. In their line of work, they learn all the best secrets.
Did he? I bet he got hurt fooling around with the spider constructs.
It's probably in the prison warden's office. It'll be a long walk. The shorter paths up to it crumbled or collapsed long ago.\n\nThere will be a lot of ferals to deal with on the way up.
I came back to look for my wife's cousin Renvis and the rest of our missing workers, but I haven't had much luck.  \n\nI've been stumbling around in the dark, trying to avoid getting eaten by kwama. But I did discover something quite disturbing.
Yes, I'm sure.  Consider this part a pass.  Now you can move on to the next part.
I'm not sure. Its emitter … thing … is broken. I could fix it if I had some spare parts.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can get your sparky little friend to help us.
That milk-drinker? Ha! He's probably locked in his ship, pointing his sword at anyone not in one of his precious fancy uniforms.\n\nGo to the bar near the docks. His men'll likely be there, getting stanky Elf-drink all over their uniforms.
<<1>> is an Ayleid ruin. \n\nWe knew it protected a well of great magical power, but we never knew how to unlock it, not until the Dominion started poking around for the keystones.
Me? Why I'm … an amateur archaeologist. Yes. Yes, I'm an archaeologist!\n\nI came here looking for artifacts and such.
I made some gold off that loot you salvaged. My family is eating right for the first time in a long time. Really, I can't thank you enough.
I would if I could! \n\nThe relics here date from before my people stopped building xanmeers and started living in mud huts. We know they're an important link to my people's past.
Fun? For me, yes. For you, not so much.\n\nGet ready to lose, loser.
I killed something once, but it was an accident.\n\nWait, why are you bringing this up? Academy students just spar. They never fight to the death.
You persist! Very well. We used three Focus Stones in our binding ritual. Obtain the Focus Stone of Flame from the southern rim of the caldera.\n\nMind the lava. You look quite flammable.
You've seen it. War and disease ravage our lands. We're surrounded by enemies, yet still we tear at each other's throats.\n\nOur students will help change that. And you will keep them safe so they can fulfill their destiny.
Well, this is the only place to get a drink near my ship, but that Suron guy gets under my skin. If he tells one more Nord joke, I'm doing to stomp his face.
<This chest contains a <<1>>.>
Hadmar isn't sure. One moment I was walking to instruction hall, next moment—boom! Hadmar knocked on backside.\n\nWoke up in here, with Arch-Mage standing over me. He said wait for you to show up. I waited, and you showed up!
He said we'd need the wand, but he didn't say why.\n\nWait, I know! The Maulborn have occupied the library vaults and sealed the door. And what makes the best spell of unlocking? Burnt Scamp hide and illusion dust, of course!
The Dominion retreated into the ruins after the lamias tore them apart. If we strike while they're bloody, we can pay them back for <<1>>!
Sure, I remember him here! But not his business. I think he spoke with Akhita a few times. Wish he was still around. Be interested to hear what he thinks of this contract. Knowing the council's all torn up about it ….
Woof!
arf arf
I'll mix this. And this.\n\nThere. Now to test it. Would you take this to my assistant?
I suppose I can give you a little more.\n\nThere! This should last nearly twice as long.
I'm talented. My skill pours from the sky. I never even picked up a book, but look how naturally I brewed this potion!\n\nAnd look how colorful it is! That's talent.
I am Lord Sheogorath's chamberlain. I handle his affairs and look after the Shivering Isles while his lordship is away.
Such wisdom in a slave. My oath was to forever bear arms and armor in the name of my liege lord. Your plunderous ways freed me from mystification!\n\nI swore to my liege lord, not the <<1>>! This travesty ends now.
There's more to it, isn't there? \n\nThe Dominion used crystals on our people. Pulling at them from inside their heads, they said. But some don't remember it at all. Why?
Ah, that clears it up.\n\n<<1>> has developed a strong connection to the Hist through this experience, something he lacked since his birth. He must become a healer. Please convince him of his destiny.
The game is a foot. Or a leg. In fact, all manner of severed limbs.\n\nBut don't worry about that! I've brought you here because I've been watching you. You work too hard! You need a nice little vacation.
They'll focus your Magicka, attune your life energies, and draw him to this place.\n\nThe ritual will apparently also link your mind with his.
Yes, actually. It's very pleasant. Some odd things, here and there, but overall … look, are you room service or not?
What? Let me see that!\n\nNo. He only wanted immortality? We trusted him!
He's a fisherman. Fisher-lad. He stops by every day to see me.\n\nHe's always making dirty comments. Someday, my da's going to hurt him.
My first thought was the Imperials did this, but these fires were set too recently. The Imperials left before I set out.\n\nLooters, maybe? Or whoever summoned the Daedra?
Most of his guards won't look twice at you if you're wearing a uniform but <<1>> and his dogs won't be fooled.\n\nYou could use a uniform to avoid detection and get to him when he's alone.
The Dark Elf vicecanon returns to the old ways, when egg-clutches hatched as slaves. She destroyed a hatching to remind the Hist of her power.\n\nIf our brother speaks lies, we must feed him to the mire. Which is the truth of it, flesh-walker?
Great power ripped open a way to Oblivion here, and that can never fully be shut. Scamps are the skeevers of those realms, wriggling through the gaps. \n\nIll-smelling, fire-spewing skeevers who killed my assistants and drove me from the ruins.
You're asking me about Argonians? That's cute. I know you like your mud, and you rarely get upset. Most Argonians I've met mostly keep to themselves.\n\nAlso, we once held you as slaves. So there's that. Sorry.
My mood is taunting, mocking. Isn't that great?
I can't make this decision. Colors and I have fought side-by-side in some of the worst places on Nirn. Whatever caused her to act this way … if she'd just spoken to me … made me understand. Stendarr's blade!
I know your decision will be just. What have you decided?
It sounds like the witches attacked before we arrived.\n\nI wonder if the Keepers were already cursed when this was written. That would explain why they were acting strangely.
Raiders? In Bal Foyen? Take the kindlepitch. Warn the Watch.\n\nYou are sun-blessed for telling me. Have you spoken with Urona at the fort already?
And you brought me its toe. I was only joking about that, but thank you.\n\nI started organizing things here. I don't suppose you ran into my brother Bjoruld, did you? He looks like me, but he's not as smart.
<<1>> knows there's a contract on him. He's locked himself away in an ancient crypt.\n\nYou'll find him hiding in the ruins, but you'll need a key to enter. I am sure the guards will have one.
Wonderful! I'm sure it will make a delightful mead.\n\nAnd another batch is ready. I would be honored if you would be the first to taste it.
What? Were you raised by an ignorant Dark Elf?\n\nShe's our goddess! Widow of Shor and Goddess of Storm! Kyne gave us life. She protects us in battle. She blesses our weapons and armor. And when we fall, Kyne leads us to Sovngarde.
There is a lost city beneath the sands somewhere in the rocky expanse east of the Alik'r Desert, or so Tavo thought. We've been mixed up with so many awful people lately that I'm beginning to doubt the information he got was genuine.
No, I can't. If what you say is true, then it's already too late for my mother.\n\nDo what you must to save those people, but I can't face what she's become.
I want Feyne by my side wherever we live. Clearly, she's not happy in the mire, and I wasn't happy in Narsis.\n\nYou've traveled. I trust you. What would you do?
I want to think so. I really do. But the Bretons are known for their magic. If they could find a way through or around the walls ….
Hurry back.
I had a feeling about you! Glad to see that I was right.\n\nNow follow us!
There were too many. The Daggers came off their ships in waves. Rana, Seyne, and the others held their ground.\n\nCaptain Rana got the Breton who led the sack of Bleakrock.
Unfortunately, Captain Rana and Sergeant Seyne were both … casualties. \n\nThey'll be buried with highest military honors. And they will be remembered.
Talk means nothing. A blood contract, on the other hand, is binding. \n\nTake my dagger, Viper's Strike. Use it on any Stormfists you slay. It absorbs the blood of enemies to power its enchantment. Return it to me when it is fully charged.
I'm taking the gauntlets off and granting you the authority to do whatever is necessary to deal with these assassins.\n\nI name you as Justice Carl of Windhelm. Dispense your authority as needed and deal with this as quickly as you can.
That's your misfortune, not mine.
Perfect! You know that you have to poison him, so what better way than putting the poison into his drink!
How? What do you mean how? Find a rat, catch it, with your hands. Then open up your backpack and let it go somewhere where an animal will see it. It's not complicated. Please, keep questions like that on the inside or else I may get upset.
The Webspinner. Mephala, princess of secrets; the Anticipation of Vivec; she who weaves the sordid web of mortal affairs. Do you know nothing of the world you live in?
Holgunn? He's as Nord as they come. A raging blizzard in the middle of summer, Holgunn is.\n\nHe served in the Akaviri War, fighting alongside Tanval, the grandmaster of House Indoril.
These creatures are the twisted offspring of a vampire and their bite is just as dangerous.\n\nOnce bitten, the curse seeps into your body. It gets into your blood until the fever takes you. Then the craving comes over you—the craving for blood.
I don't have to open this. I know that Harvald is concerned about Irnskar. Assure him that I'm well enough to guide my son and my kingdom.\n\nTell Harvald that I will talk to him later.
That's the Nord spirit! Sort of.\n\nNext time though, try it like this: "I suppose one drink isn't enough!"
You really are simple, aren't you? Well, so how would one get on board a Blacksails ship? Oh, I don't know, maybe by being a Blacksail? Several are drunk in the bar. Think about that, if you can manage, and don't get into trouble or so help me…
This job will be slightly different as you may need to deal with some hostile people. Iin house, guards are oblivious slouches. Unfortunately, they are also tough as nails. They'll stomp you if you rumage through their things. So, don't get caught.
I haven't seen him much. I heard with all the Blacksails being killed that he fears for his life. So he's taken some of his friends and locked himself downstairs. I haven't been down there, not yet anyway.
Interesting … what a strange thing. How are we being obvious enough to stir suspicion? I'll have to talk to the Listener about this. \n\nNever mind that, we know where he is, now you have to figure out how to unlock that door.
The Captain wants us to eliminate Shaman Moramat. She's powerful and she's responsible for many Pact deaths. The Captain also wants whatever orders Moramat carries.\n\nRemoving the shaman would be good for morale—especially mine.
The key is lost. But I know where it is. Sort of. One of my wolf friends snatched it off my belt. Swallowed it in one gulp.\n\nI refuse to kill them for a key. They are beautiful, noble creatures. A woman who once loved me treated them as kin.
Then you've thwarted the necromancers' plans to enslave the creatures of Ouze. They've one recourse left to them, but with your help, I can stop it.
No, I wish I could. That poor bard, I think I remember him yelling, too.
I'm not really sure. Some kind of disease, as I hear it. The local troops are having a hard time dealing with the situation.\n\nCommand thinks a group of irregulars might be able to help.
What? You wouldn't leave me in here? I had no idea the lute would attract the rieklings! It never did before! And I never wanted the workers to get hurt.\n\nI'm not a violent person.
What can you do? What you must.\n\nMathragor has put his trust in you before. You have the chance to guide him away from this path.
You deny an invitation from my lord? You are foolish, just like the ones before you.\n\nMajorn shall know of this. You have made a terrible mistake this day.
You can't stop me. No one can stop me.\n\nI'll continue to feed. I'll grow strong. I'll defeat the ancients!
Yes, it all becomes clear. She chose you to set her mistake right. And that you must do, brave one.
You're right. Those stuffed robes wouldn't last an hour down here, but we do it all the time.\n\nThey'll pay good money for what we find, and we can remain our own bosses!
I will not! They must all pay. Do you hear me? They must pay with their lives!\n\nI'll suffer no Drublog on these lands as long as I draw breath!
<Agnedir's wounds indicate the draugr killed her.>
Three burial urns chain my spirit to this cavern. I cannot leave while they remain. Destroy them and I can escape before the cultists bind me.\n\nTwo urns rest in the lower reaches of the cave. Destroy those first.
What do you wish to know?
No, Shor take them. The soldiers won't do anything. They say we're making it up.\n\nWait. Do you smell something?
Help? If you're lucky, I won't kill them myself! \n\nThey've severely taxed the sphere so much, I was forced to wake. And now I am forced to defend what they cannot.
I agree. I've recovered sufficient magicka to create a portal out of Jathsogur.\n\nAre you ready to go?
Something gnawed on the cover. Ah, well! The uninitiated are always hungry for knowledge.\n\nLet me see what Ovuld has to say about this metal.
The spinners defied the Hound, so he bound them with elements of their own strengths.\n\nHe even bound <<1>>, the strongest of the three. She'll grow even older in her prison!
You must mean that drunken idiot who tried to keep up with Jeggi. He wasn't even in the same league.\n\nWhatever he was drinking was pretty foul, though. Smelled more like wet kagouti than sweet mead. I think it might have been Argonian.
<The ornate door is locked shut, but shows signs of recent use.>
<From the other side you hear a quiet shuffling, a pause, and then a loud click as the door unlocks.>
<…>
<…>
<A scattering of crudely made arrows, perhaps dropped during a struggle. It appears that whoever attacked Cragwallow used this path.>
Oh, I suppose you wouldn't remember me.\n\nI was just a lowly registrar in Mournhold when you and your friend Rigurt visited my fair city.
Then you know what a good man he is!\n\nFind him for me, my new friend.
It's just a family farm. My father got her started, back before I was born. The locals called it Treva's Farm. We mostly grow enough food to feed ourselves, and sell the extra in the Riften market.
Yes, of course. I did promise. \n\nI don't suppose I could just promise to find a new line of work? Then we can just skip the part that requires me to surrender.
A monster! No doubt some vile beast from the darkest reaches of Oblivion!\n\nI can't imagine how it got here. And I have no idea why it would do such things to our soldiers.
He consorted with Oblivion to ascend to power. Those who stood in his way, he killed, though always under mysterious circumstances.\n\nEventually, those around him saw through his schemes and imprisoned him. Lifetimes have passed, but Rilis remains.
Windows are wonderful things, my darling. No one ever remembers to lock them!\n\nI'm sure you've crawled into or out of more than a few windows over the course of your adventures.
Lately he's been directing the household. Telling grandfather what to do. You saw it, didn't you? Grandfather didn't order you away. Thorulf did.
Yes, I—don't say it. Please. I know what you're thinking. I couldn't bear to hear it. He's had a hard life. We all have.
There's no time. She's fading away as we speak!\n\nI must make this sacrifice for the good of the henge … for the good of the Bosmer.
Excellent. Do you know the way? I can lead you to the front.
There's the King's festival if that type of thing interests you. \n\nMe? I'm not a fan of large crowds. They bring in all kinds of trouble.
Well, you arrived just in time for the King's Konunleikar festival. Clans from all across Skyrim have come to compete in the games. It's all to honor King Jorunn's rise to power.
Quiet! Fine. Go. Don't look for Laughs-at-Danger again!
<The crude figures carved in the rock wall are Nord runes, not the Dragon-speech elsewhere around the temple. The dialect is archaic, but you distinctly make out the words "use three" and "different.">
By all means. "Circus of Cheerful Slaughter" is just there on the desk. \n\nBut be careful. The treachery of the Mad God knows no bounds.
Luckily none of my people were lost. But poor Asmalah. He acted out of grief. Out of love for the woman he lost.\n\nI forgive him.
Of course. A favor was promised, and a favor you shall receive.\n\nWhat do you ask of me?
Of course you are. Of course. That's your story and you're sticking to it.\n\nTake my blood. Turn your King. Let him become one of us. I look forward to seeing how this plays out!
Eh. Have you ever fought a starving bear with a scat rake? No? In comparison, zombies are like sweet rolls. Get on with ya.
Let Aelif see … this is Jofnir's! His body, here? But why? He was to be interred near his home in Eastmarch.
Knowing the mage, I only have my best guess. The tiles represent the great constellations. \n\nHe held the guardian constellations in high regard—the Mage, the Thief, and the Warrior.
Oh, I see. After ten years "protecting" this pass, no one remembers Unnvald Ironhand. You think I'm some feeble old man. When you were a twinkle in your da's breeches, I led warriors into the heart of Morrowind!
She was traveling with us to Silvenar, a Bosmer city some distance from here. <<1>> managed to slip away in the confusion of the attack.\n\nLater on, she snuck back in and rescued us.
When the Skald-King calls, the people answer! I should have dealt with the Worm Cult long ago. Before they grew in strength and numbers.\n\nWe must defeat them here. Then we can attack their base at Arcwind Point.
There's not much time. What do you need to know?
You what? Do you have any idea what you've done?
Go ahead.
We'll … we'll rebuild. When you see the Queen again, tell her I'm going to take on the position of Canonreeve. For the time being. Just until we get things set right. \n\nI won't let my father's cruelty stain our town.
Such a generous soul! You see, in the midst of this destruction you have made J'darzi's day. Enjoy the finest that Elsweyr has to offer.
Yes. I am sure I can make it to the camp, especially if it means I'll see Dadazi again.\n\nBut, there is one more thing. I hate to ask, but ….
You have to ask, I have nothing to tell you. When you know what you want, come talk to Rejmina.
Such a shame. Ezduiin was once an elegant Ayleid town. A testament to the greatness of the ancients.\n\nTrade and travelers flowed through Ezduiin, right up until the end.
Estre has sealed the castle within a powerful barrier. It's powered by wards and guarded by Dremora. \n\nDestroy the wards and we drop the barrier.
My cousin, Lupandinus, accompanied me here. We heard that Windhelm didn't have any true alchemists, so we decided to set up shop here and make our fortune.
Don't you know where you are? This is a sacred place to the Orcs. The ritual arena of Malacath. When you blow the horn, you'll signal the giants and challenge Lob at the same time. He'll have no choice but to follow the rules of the arena.
Well enough. It's good to have a reason to get up in the morning. Without my family the way it was … it's easy to wallow in thoughts of Bleakrock. Of the good days.
The Drublog used a foul spell to trap me; I've never encountered it before.\n\nThat same energy prevents anything beyond this Psijic contact. I can't escape without your help.
Thank you! Here I thought my biggest problem was keeping the farm. Now I'm worried about catching the plague.\n\nThe Stars move, I suppose.
Back in the bad old days, before the Pact, Fort Virak sent necromancers up into the Rift. They thought to overwhelm us with undead.\n\nGrandfather stood against them with Bonebane, and crushed the assault. His troops called it the Battle of the Bones.
Very good. The Gold Coast mercenaries are nothing if not skilled at fighting. The werewolves will be no match for them.\n\nHonorable Eraral-dro spoke highly of your skill. We'd hoped you'd follow through with our little deception.
This debacle is all Merormo's fault! These beasts, controlled by Daedra? All his idea. \n\nHe was trying to create animal soldiers. Fanged shocktroops with the ability to reason.
No. Some leave us. If it's in their nature to wander, they go. \n\nWe honor our vows to the Ghost Snake. The outside world only occasionally intrudes upon our peaceful existence.
Well, that's an opening Innbild would have jumped on. Lucky for you, I'm not my sister.
While I appreciate the Queen coming to Auridon, all this talk of the Veiled Heritance has me worried. I don't want to be caught in the middle of their own personal war.
Of course! But you need to guess. What do you think my event is?
Aye, but at least I have what we came here for. I suppose I'll collect some water and mudcrabs for a Crustacean Stout while <<1>> seeks transport.\n\nAssuming the Maormer don't kill me, I know this island well enough to survive.
<You take the note from between the pages.>
Yes. And to do that you'll need to get past the mercenaries. The unsmiling thugs at the door won't give me the time of day. Maybe one of the others could be convinced to help you? \n\nOr maybe a disguise? I don't know.
Me? No. He's the spiritual heart of Valenwood. The power of the forest courses through his veins like blood.\n\nFrom what I hear, you can tell that from looking at him. The Green Lady's lucky, if you ask me.
Escort the scout to the ritual site and stop those cultists! She's ready when you are.
Have you no heart? I want to save my husband, yes, but also the entire city! I've tried for so many years. I can't give up! I won't!\n\nI'm going after them now!
Oh! All right, then. What was it? Right, the supplies. \n\nTwo of my cooks took deathly ill, right in the middle of preparing the Queen's feast! I suspect sabotage. I want to be sure all of our food supplies are safe.
What's that in your pack? Deployment plans for the marines at the temple. And do I smell the taint of poison on the air? These are the tools of an assassin!\n\nIt's no use arguing, scum. Not another word out of you.
Really? Plague? Kidnappings? Hostile cultists? Boring!\n\nJust ask my father, the House Councilor. He says there's nothing to the rumors.
Helushk's soldiers? Can't you see them? They're guarding the entrance to the Daedric shrine!
Well, they haven't tried to catch me yet, but Helushk's soldiers are crazy! They're up there, guarding the shrine and practicing, night and day. They think being undead is great. They're insane!
Say, something seems to be coming back to me. Last I heard, he was setting up camp to the northeast, near the river. \n\nJust don't say I told you, all right?
Are you crazy, or have you been talking to Chirah's Followers?\n\nThose miserable fanatics would rather die than live forever. Yes, we're undead, but we're also immortal! We can fight and fall a thousand times and never die.
Damn you. And that Bosmer witch!
Navigate the puzzle. Get past the doors. Stop them!
She's long gone by now. No fool, that one. Moves on once locals are wise to her.
Of course it's true! It's a Nord legend, isn't it?
Probably talking up the "unity of the Dominion." Not all the Altmer are fans of the alliance yet. \n\nNo offense.
Search the ruins. See if you can find a ghost wandering around, or wailing or rattling chains, or doing whatever ghosts do.\n\nDo you think I should hire a priest to perform some kind of ritual? Owning a haunted estate is all rather new to me.
Dead? Dark Moon and dull claws. Damn these fanatics.
Green bless you, then! I have everything I need from this hut. Was just about to take my leave. Would you do me a favor and clean up? I want to make my report.
No one will be truly safe until these Spider Cultists are defeated. I don't understand the method behind it, but they're bringing innocents here to enslave them with their magic.\n\nI'm fearful of asking, but were there other survivors?
I have to. This is justice. He's a traitor to the crown. To his family.
Do I look like a steward's assistant? Do you take me for a commoner? No. But, yes, I happen to know where she is. \n\nEast warehouse, just north of the docks. You can go now.
Ah! A patriot! Let me get a look at you.
I didn't abandon them, if that's what you're asking. We were ambushed, and a dozen of us were killed in the opening moments of battle.\n\nI called for a fighting retreat, but not everyone made it back. I was the only one.
Fine. We have nothing to hide here. Visit the classrooms, spar with our instructors. You'll see our lessons are tough, but fair.
As you wish. Draw!
Why would you need those?  \n\nNever mind, I'll tell you. They're in the houses in the west side of <<1>>.
My father's a mage. His signature spell is a spell of hiding that I know can protect the villagers. If you can reach our house and prepare the spell, I can rescue the villagers and meet you there.\n\nYou just need to convince Dame Clarique to free me.
No invitation, no boat ride. Those're the rules.\n\nGo talk to the new students. Maybe they can explain things so that even you can understand.
The captain can only see what's in his mind now. If he wants to relive his past and call it an adventure, so be it.\n\nI just wish he'd listen to me sometimes.
We were in transit. Ayrenn. Her Majesty, I mean. She's taking a tour of the realm, and her closest advisors travel with her.
I brought a few things in with me. Oil. Some flint and tinder. And I think I saw a pile of straw somewhere while I was wandering around.\n\nJust. Hurry.
Rela leads the Pact here. From some place called Mournhold. Sent by those freaky god-people on the Tribunal, or so I hear it.
It's a protection spell. Lodorr's soul is still bound to the crown. Quickly, there's no time. Give it to me!
Only Auri-El knows. Dawnbreak's a supply stop between Firsthold and Skywatch, no different than any other town in Auridon. \n\nJust glad the High Kinlady wasn't here when they hit. She left an hour or two before we saw the first Daedra.
Poor girl. Thank you, for what you could do.\n\nIn the meantime, I've sent out patrols to hunt down any remaining Daedra. They should report back soon.
Thank you. You've been ever so helpful. It's a shame I have to kill you.
<He stares at you.>
Go. Have to keep my eyes open.
I cannot argue with you. The ones who fled, or who shriveled into the beings we see wandering about will never see Sovngarde, It weighs heavily on me. \n\nSpeak to Nelhilda. Tell her… tell her.
Three-and-five-times blessed am I. Thank you.\n\nAnd blessings to you as well.
No! It can't be true. It can't. He … he was just here.\n\nFine. Fine, I'll go.
Aye, that'd be a fine end to our adventure. We find the great Lost Fleet, and then we walk away from it. \n\nWe lost too many crewmates finding this place. We owe it to them to do at least a little plundering before we pack it in.
Find the Admiral and destroy him.\n\nHe's using the ruins of the fleet to build his Coral Tower. He wants to reach the portal in the sky. We're his slaves, working endlessly to make his mad desires come true.
I don't know what you're talking about. I've been here forever, enjoying the drinks and the fire pit dancing.
That's fair, friend. The work here is rough and tiresome, but it's good, honest work. At least, working the forge is honest. Don't know about the people who run it.
I lost some of my apprentices to the beasts. So when I made it back to town, I cast a spell that would protect everyone. It was the only way.
You must try our Special Blend. Do you like to celebrate? Everyone here is always celebrating something!\n\nNelhilda and Gamirth were working to find a way to end this madness. Go upstairs and talk to Nelhilda. She has a plan.
Telenger the Artificer, greatest Mage of our time! He's in the field, even now, in the ruin just below Skywatch. \n\nSometimes I like to imagine I can see him down there, among the old buildings of Ezduiin.
Do not attempt to know my heart, mortal.\n\nJuline is pure. Unlike the rest of my army, she's not tainted by corruption. I need one such as her if I am to win this war.
It's the Queen, Ayrenn. We were supposed to leave town, but word of Ayrenn's schedule reached us. I wanted to see our new Queen, the founder of the Dominion. If only I'd been less selfish.
Yes. Esaranir enjoys hunting. He barely made it back from Shattered Grove. It seems Daedric activity is everywhere these days.
The amulet would be a catalyst for spells <<1>> has been researching.  He hopes to use it to recharge staves more quickly.\n\nWell, I found a wamasu for him, but I won't be his test guar any longer.
She's an interesting one. Not bad to look at, as far as evil creatures from Oblivion go, but she has a mean streak.\n\nI'd be careful around her, if I were you.
Indeed. All kinds of rumors. \n\nSpies at court. An attempt on the Duchess's life. An army of Redguards with orders to storm the castle. \n\nSir Hughes, the head of the Knights of the Flame, sent me here to make sure the village remains secure.
Be my guest. Just don't expect any help from the guard. \n\nThe slavers are like rats—quick to scurry back into a hole—but they fight nasty when they're cornered.
I'll try to retrace my steps. It's so easy to get turned around in this place!
Fine. I'm the one who poisoned the stronghold.\n\nBut what I did was for the good of my people.
<The bookcase is protected by an ancient grate, yet there seem to be books missing from its shelves.>
Mine was a nightmare of betrayal, and they are among my betrayers. Count Hosni was betrothed to our Sister Safia before he met Lady Adima. \n\nAnd there is another reason.
Not every day, no. But it's not unusual for us to zoom off to some distant location every few weeks or so.
Think so. As far as you can trust any Orc. \n\nShe's loyal enough. Refused to leave her husband behind. No negotiation on that point.
Can't say I'm much a fan of Argonians. I suppose I can't help but associate them with the Pact. \n\nThe Guild walks a neutral line, though, so it's not fair to hold that against her.
Nonsense. I'll send for Mages Guild healers to treat her immediately.\n\nDon't you worry about <<1>>. She fought like she was born with six claws. There's no way she'll go without a fight.
The sage-to-be and a companion must pray at Fallowstone's shrines. Visions of the Five Hundred in their prime should appear to them. Will you take these prayer beads and accompany me?
Woman? What woman? I saw you strike down Halskar, pull something from the lockbox, and then pause for a long moment.\n\nI thought you were catching your breath up there.
If my research is correct, then you've unlocked the door to the Eye itself!\n\nAccording to my notes, the Eye is located in a chamber called the "Guardian's Orbit." Sounds … somewhat grisly. It's probably the structure up ahead.
She may not let you in, and there is still the barrier!\n\nNo. We do not hide our sugar in one boot. We go in separately.
Yes, of course. Forget the gear, just save Charadin!
Then begone. I have many things to prepare in Silvenar before I can return to <<1>>. \n\nSee that no one interferes with the ritual. <<2>> must not escape.
You have helped my people. And through your actions, you have aided me. I sense that your accomplishments thus far are only the beginning. \n\nMy registrars have given you access to the city, but I would like to personally thank you for your deeds.
The Mane is, and has always been, our spiritual leader.\n\nKhajiit may travel far and live in distant places, but deep within, we are guided by the Mane, and Riddle'Thar.
I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with what happened to the countess? \n\nDid you talk to her? What did she say? Is she all right?
You know me so well! But we'll need to get the courier's key. He's been picking up wine here, then delivering bottles around town. He tends to keep a bottle or two as he goes along.\n\nWe might be able to use that to our advantage.
I study with Telenger the Artificer. Have you heard of him? I went to Bangkorai with him once. It didn't end well for most of the students, but fortunately, I left unscathed.\n\nHe suggested I come to Belarata.
Have you ever lost a child or a spouse? Do you know what that pain is like?\n\nIt's unbearable. The Worm Cult said they could bring them back. We'd be reunited. All I had to do was pass them information.
I barely see Tryn. She's off on her missions. And she'll be dead soon, too, in this pointless war.\n\nThe Worm Cult came when I was grieving. They said they could reunite me with my husband, my boy. All I had to do was pass information about the Pact.
Maybe. But I chose to believe. It wasn't just secrets. Soon the cult asked me to kill for them. Golun. Thane Fjora.\n\nDenskar would despise what I've become. I'm done with the cult, but it's too late, isn't it?
It's been so long since I felt this joy. It feels like … hope.
That's not relevant right now, hero. Stay focused! Find the Maulborn and figure out what they're up to. Then we can talk about my sordid yet extremely intriguing past.
Thank you. The river has truly guided you here for this purpose. \n\nTake this charm. Place it near Ripplestrike's nest. He will not be able to resist the call. He will come out, and then you can kill him.
Ancient. Dwemer. Worn in places, this piece was used in one of their constructs. Smells … fresh in some ways. Has been away from any ruins for a while. Shame. Might have been able to learn something more.
The three folks I need are Crafty Lerisa, Jakarn, and Neramo. Any or all of them would do.
I'll be visiting Helane in her cabin, to thank her for the hospitality she's extended my crew.\n\nCome on up after you release Deregor. You should really say hello.
The dead do not lie so easily as the living. Yes, you can trust me. Give it to me and I'll restore it.\n\nAnything, anything just to hold it again.
Oh … oh yes! Thank you! It's been so long. \n\nI never should have shattered the sword. It was a mistake.
It matters not. All that matters now is that I might restore it and hold it once again.\n\nThere. The sword is whole again. It feels … it feels wrong though. All wrong.
Me? Did I do that? Her starving little cabin girl may have poisoned her drink. Who can say?\n\nDid Deregor get out?
I'd love to stay and watch, but no time. You can stay if you like.\n\nIt's actually her poison. Kept for slaves who disobey. There's an antidote on the dresser, if your heart bleeds enough.
Well, sometimes. But I deserved it. I'd talk back to him or I'd be gone for hours with Rilyn. I was a bad daughter and now he's gone forever!
The blasphemers employ dark magic to raise the dead. Disrupt their rituals and release that energy. The Staff of Arkay will convert this into power to destroy their dark creations!
Just exploring the island. I came across these fine fellows disturbing the graves and decided to kill a few.\n\nI've collected some robes in this bag. Take one if you want the zombies to leave you alone.
I'm with the Mages Guild. Pursuit of knowledge and standing ready against any Daedric threat—that's what we're about.\n\nSo Master Curmaland doesn't want us getting tangled up in local politics.
Indeed I have. And that's put me in their debt. More than I can ever hope to repay.\n\nBut then, you can't be in debt to dead men, can you? That's where you come in. And I've a plan that might tip the odds in your favor.
There's a small alcove nearby. An old hermit's den. I'll wait for you there.\n\nBaan Dar be with you, friend.
It's beneath the palace and anyone thrown in dies there. Jakarn said the guards are brutal and the other prisoners are worse.
More often than I'd like to admit. Every now and again some idiot decides to share his fortune with a mammoth. A few broken fingers usually put an end to it.\n\nThis is unprecedented, though. Someone must have fed them half our stock!
"Welcome! If you're reading this, something has gone horribly wrong with my most recent experiment! \n\n"I've created a potion that allows the imbiber to take control of thunderbugs. It should be right on the table. Go ahead, pick it up!"
I … am not trying to look like an Ayleid warlord—wait.\n\nI'm Nanwen. A digger. Endarwe hired me to excavate Rulanyil's Fall, and I was digging out some rooms … there was a cave-in.
I said I would think about it. \n\nIn the meantime, let me rub this salve on you. It has a scent that is pleasing to my wolf kin, so they will not attack you. It only lasts a short while, so I suggest you head back to camp.
You invaded their territory! I'm not sure I'll attend the council. I'll decide later.\n\nFor now, let me rub this salve on you. Its odor calms the wolves. It should last long enough for you to leave this area without going on another murderous rampage.
What is that delightful scent? Ah! Another admirer of wolfkind. \n\nYou've eaten a Canis Cap. You have that wonderful musky scent of fur and dirt and grass and old meat. Mmmmm.
The Baelbornes don't change! That family carries evil in its heart.\n\nLet them all rot. The ward in the waterfall will always keep the Baelbornes away. The master made it with his own blood.
<<1>> may be praying at the Green Lady's shrine in the middle of the village.\n\nShe tried to convince people to search for <<2>>, but we're not strong enough to face a pack of werewolves or Houndsmen.
Gwaering was born and raised in <<1>>! She's our current Green Lady. Several were born here.\n\nThe Green Lady represents our physical nature, just as the Silvenar represents our spirituality.
Not much. It's big and it smells. Bloodthorn cultists roam the southern fen and hags prowl the north.  \n\nI wish I had stayed in Camlorn. I thought we'd be safer out here, but look what happened. I hope Bethany's all right.
They're somewhere inside the city. The Silvenar can't sense them with the wards intact, but once the guardian's defeated, he'll be able to extend his perceptions into the city, however briefly.
I sense they're being held in the trees within the city. The bonds of Hircine surround them, however, so you can't go directly to them.\n\nYou'll need to learn about the spinners and their prisons in order to free them.
All I know are their names: <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. This is my first visit to the city and until the handfast, my connection with the Bosmer is incomplete.\n\nI know how you can learn about the three spinners, but it will be dangerous.
You'll see them soon enough. They're especially thick up north. You can't miss them. They're all twisted and diseased-looking.\n\nI'd suggest staying far away from those awful vines. They're nothing but trouble, of that I'm sure.
Now that I've had a moment to examine the ward, it will be a simple ritual to open the doors. However, it will take a few moments to complete. And I expect my efforts will not go unnoticed.
With the Bosmer surviving … and the Hound dead. She spoke as if it had already happened. She also said that each spinner has the key to his or her own release, even if they can't affect it.\n\nPlease, let me go. I'll leave the city forever!
One of the finest, my good friend! I used to own my very own tap cafe in Wayrest, before that thug <<1>> closed me down.\n\nI hope to open another one, once I collect enough coin. Maybe in Daggerfall. Hmm.
You took longer than I expected. Everything go all right?
I told her no, not this time. But now she's sent you after me. I give up.\n\nWe sacrifice so much to Zenithar, it's a wonder we have any left for ourselves. Very well, here is my share.
We fought but there were too many of them. I protected Iriana as long as I could but I got knocked out. I saw them dragging her away as I fell.
He said that? After all this, he wants to give up? <<1>> and I, what've we got besides each other?\n\nDoesn't matter what you say. I'll find a way to save him, with or without that plant.
Illusions. The blessing reveals a spiritual imprint left at this place.\n\nY'ffre has blessed us with this memory to show us the spirit of true courage and self-sacrifice.
You've never heard of Telenger? He's a national treasure. An Archmage, a living connection to the past. I hear he has quite the shop set up in Skywatch.
She's in Saintsport. The Sea Drakes lured her ship onto the rocks. Those bastards really know how to ruin your day.\n\nIt's south of <<1>>. Look for the big lighthouse.
Ha. No, Raz and I met while I was traveling, many years ago. We met in Wayrest. Or was it Whiterun? Something with a "W."\n\nThe story's a long one, and involves a drunken schoolmarm and a purple velvet dress. Ahem.
Very good. While you're slaughtering the Houndsmen, I can safely make my way to our camp.\n\nHope to see you there.
We came to mine, but got trapped by bears. Eventually we ran out of food, and my whole family perished.
The Bosmer were once carefree, untroubled by things beyond Valenwood. With changing times, we also changed.\n\nThe Silvenar holds the spiritual essence of the Bosmer, and the Green Lady holds the physical aspects. Each generation, we renew our vows.
The Oathbreakers. We spurned Y'ffre's will, and we paid the price. Our lives.\n\nY'ffre can be just as cruel as she is compassionate. Beware the wrath of gods, mortal.
Indeed. For the sake of Stormhaven and for the sake of the Daggerfall Covenant as a whole.\n\nEnough dreary talk though. The good news is that Vaermina and her Daedra are gone. Come with me to the throne room.
Not really. The mammoths usually sleep it off, but this time they got out. And they really, really hate to be woken up.\n\nBut I'm sure you'll have no trouble! I mean, just stand back a bit!
How? He's just a man, my love. I'll stick my sword in him a few times until he drops. Then I'll stab him again!\n\nI'll be back in no time, carrying his head high as a trophy. I can't think of a better gift to celebrate our new family.
My journey isn't planned. It just happens.\n\nThis town could be a good place to settle for a while, now that the troubles are over. Perhaps I will stay here until I move on.
You're the hero of Malabal Tor! Turned back the Redguards at Velyn Harbor, fought the Drublog in Dra'bul and Jathsogur, and trounced the Hound in Silvenar!\n\nI've had many a toast in your name, friend,
A prison of the mind. Built for who I once was. Hircine gazed into my soul, turning memories into a torturous labyrinth.\n\nOne part of me escaped. And Hircine made it into a weapon.
Deep within the prison, where <<1>> cracks his mind like a nut. If she succeeds, she will hollow him out and make him into one of her servants.\n\nHis shell will roam Nirn, hunting and killing everyone he ever knew.
A foolish war against the might of a Daedric Prince? Why would Aelif want to put an end to that? This one has the backing of the generals, comrade. You may be speaking with the new Guildmaster after today.
You don't know? We—the Bosmer, I mean—don't eat plants. We don't farm and we certainly don't cut down trees!\n\nIn exchange, the forest provides for us. You've seen our homes? They're grown that way!
I am of the Green, of the dark and growing depths. My lifeblood pulses through the roots. My skin smells of loam.
You interrupted the flow of that Conduit Stone, causing an overload. Maormer equipment can be delicate.\n\nIt is well that you did—Maormer use Conduit Stones to enhance their magic. It will be more difficult for them to maintain this storm, now.
Lord Gharesh-ri knows more, but his vision may be colored by hope. Mine is not. The Mane has always been greedy and self-serving, but lately he has been cruel. His orders do not benefit the Khajiit as they once did.\n\nHe changed before we came here.
I don't think they know Gwaering, the Green Lady, is my sister. They were looking for easy prey.\n\nHah, I put up quite a fight! Nothing was easy for them.
<This door is sealed by a force you cannot overcome.>
For now. <<1>> always got a little strange every few years. Spirits, strange lights. It's different every time.
Hrm. Not much like one. How do I know this isn't a trick?\n\nWell, if you give my shield back, I'll let you off the hook. This time.
Ha! To hear him tell it, it was all his idea. Vanus Galerion, First Mage of Firsthold, was the real founder of the guild. Rilis just allowed him to do his work in the city. \n\nI heard rumors he even bargained with Galerion for access to Oblivion.
Many different ones. It's such trouble to write them down.\n\n<<1>> usually talks only of the Silvenar. He's the one who noticed their story had changed.
Let me see that. What in the name of …?\n\nLord Diel's been poisoning the harpies the entire time! He orchestrated their frenzy! And he claimed he's been trying to help. He's been using us!
Thank you! May the stars always shine upon you.
This dagger you've handed me has a very sharp edge. No, not you. The Daggers are of my own making.\n\nLet's find Lord Diel, give him his egg, and get our gold. Our families won't go hungry, but I may never sleep well again after this.
You've done enough. Just keep Lord Diel busy. It's not up to you to finish this. That's work for the Daggers.\n\nEven if it turns out to be our last job, we're going to do it right.
There is nothing simple about this matter. You must return the relics to the exact spot they were taken from. Inspect each chamber carefully, for there will be clues as to the proper placement.\n\nI can advise you, but I know little of these relics.
Let me think … wait a moment! The way he shrank back from our torches ….\n\nFire! That's the answer. It has to be! Tell the others. Help them. If Faolchu isn't killed, we all lose.
Just appeal to his vanity. The old lizard's pride got me into this—I don't see why it shouldn't get me out, too!\n\nHe's probably just outside the city, hunting. That's what he does all the time. Thinks he's the greatest gamesman in Shadowfen.
Well, out with it. I don't have all day.\n\nYour disguise is terrible, by the way. You look like a character from a bad adventure novel.
Excellent work. I've managed to find where the stones are being held. They're stashed in a pair of chests here in the Colovian camp. They've set two of their most powerful mages to guard them.
Good. Here it is ….\n\nDripping crimson, it washes across battlefields. Both friend and foe fall in its wake. The few who defeat this undying enemy surrender to its cold embrace.
By the Three, you did it! You saved my life and returned my livelihood.\n\nI don't have much, but what little I have is yours. I'll earn it back, and more, when they hear me play in Stormhold.
Trust no one but yourself. And maybe me. Once this gets out of your hands, you have no idea who'll get hold of it. You need to destroy it.
Save the citizens
Have you not listened to Kaleen? Her words betray visions of power over her enemies.\n\nThis thing must be destroyed! We cannot allow this curse to fall upon anyone else.
The Dunmer crept up from the south and attacked in the dark. They killed the watch guard, but not before he sounded the alarm.\n\nWe reacted fast. I had … an uneasy feeling, so we were on alert. Lost a few good men, but the Dunmer lost more.
Right. But the worst part is, I think I'm stuck like this. I put a pile of gold on the wager and we sealed the bet with a spell. A binding contract spell. \n\nUntil I can win or lose the wager, I don't think I can move on.
It's not that simple! There's a whole ritual to perform. The tree-minders must first calm the dreugh, and then return the relics to their containers.\n\nBut my father knows this. He knows the relics can't be disturbed. This is madness!
Even in death, the Fenlords distrust their servants. To guard against rebellion, they inserted control icons into the heads of their arisen slaves.\n\n<<1>> found one. With it, I hoped to gain passage through this place, but its magic is stale.
In my darkest hour, I prayed to every god and creature on Nirn. I was desperate. I needed a way to change what was. Change the story of the Bosmer.\n\nI found it here.
We came for the circlet. General Lavinia has great plans. We've … we've started with Arenthia. With the circlet, we'll take the Dominion apart piece … by … piece.
A good Orc female doesn't spend her time on frivolous courting. When she wants you, she takes you. I've made my interest clear, so now it's up to her.\n\nI need another drink.
Not without getting that totem out of here. They can smell it or something. Even then, we'll need reinforcements to take back the Watch. \n\nI sent a request to Captain Ernard, but if he doesn't arrive soon, we'll just have to withdraw.
Ayleid necromancer kings who once ruled Black Marsh. When their slaves rose against them, the Fenlords had them executed and revived as undead.\n\nPreserved against the ages, they toil even now, protecting the tombs of their long-dead masters.
At the bottom of the hill the abbey sits upon. Here. I'll mark it on your map. \n\nI'd be careful if you go down there. It could be dangerous!
Yes, but the dream is Hosni's. Somewhere in this dream is the Omen of Blood, the demon from Quagmire that drives him to madness. \n\nYou must find the Omen, and slay it.
I pay her no mind. I only wish I'd given Tazgol a daughter. My boys are strong, but the clan needs more daughters.
I'll tell Blue-Bird about her egg-sister. Then I'll let the clan grieve for its loss.\n\nOnce I know the clan is safe, I will move on. Find a new purpose. That's the way of the Dreamwalker.
I believe that I can trust you. If you help me with something, I'll do whatever you ask as long as it doesn't involve hurting anyone.
That's exactly what I told Afren! He's all talk, though. His mouth starts running after he gets a few drinks in him and talks big. \n\nHe's probably sleeping it off somewhere nearby. He'll wake up tomorrow and forget all about Silumm.
You don't have to tell me twice!
You see the spriggans and lurchers everywhere? They feel it. The coming invasion. Daedra.\n\nI am the last priest of the Wooded Eye. We were charged with protecting this grove, but the wards have failed. We have failed.
Tavo invested in a speculative prospecting expedition. They didn't even find enough gold to pay the diggers. We lost everything.\n\nThe Lost City was just a rumor, but we were desperate. Yombira loaned us the money, and … well, you know the rest.
I expect it's because it's one of the few structures here that isn't sinking into the swamp.\n\nThat and being in close proximity to an Ayleid ruin means we don't have to go far for research material.
It's not like that! The Argonians don't pay us a cut, is all.\n\nBut maybe the other side of town could use a patrol, right?
Light the signal fire. That's the sign the King's troops are waiting for before they make their final push up the mountain.\n\nThat said, I still don't think they'll make it in time. You need to reach Fildgor and slow him down. Good luck.
<The dead soldier's unit markings match those of <<1>>. His skin is slightly charred, like other victims of the skin-stealers.>
I don't have the money. Do your worst, ruffian.
I think that this part of the forest belongs to a spriggan matron. At least, she's certainly treating the place like it's hers. \n\nShe sent the forest trolls and lesser spriggans to harass us and drive us off.
Yes, you marvelous fool. I allowed them to pull me from Oblivion, bind my essence, and siphon my power because I'm secretly behind their shabby little plans.\n\nOh, but you don't know about those, do you?
Gone. Whatever the Hist showed him, he was in a hurry to act. Perhaps his people are threatened as well?
Oh, sorry. There's a lot going on. Did you happen to find him?
You have to look at this from my point of view.\n\nA stranger walks into town and makes outlandish claims about spies and imposters and murders. How do I know that you're not one of these Stormfist traitors trying to cause trouble?
Yes, of course! Please, help me!\n\nLook, I'm sure you don't mean it. There's no help for him. My brother, that is. I don't expect to see him again, and … why am I even telling you this?
How do you think I make a living? I buy there, sell here. It's what I do. All legitimate, of course.\n\nPicked up a load of timber in Wayrest—it'll sell for a pile of coin here. It better.
The Fangs are our birthright! They are dangerous, yes, but the Night Mother will shield us from the worst of their influence.\n\nAnd if they overwhelm me, the other Shadowscales won't hesitate to send me back to the Hist.
<<1>> of the Shadowscales. The Fangs of Sithis must not fall into the hands of the ignorant.\n\nHand them over or face the Night Mother's wrath!
Kothringi … yes. I remember now! I am a Kothringi! A plague swept across the village. Sickness, death, corpses piled everywhere ….\n\nIs that why I entered the temple? To find the keystone?
When he saw the Daedra, Esan may have raided a vault at the temple. He stole a fang talisman, a magical relic. He's attuned it such that we can focus its power and seal the portals. I'm sure the priests wouldn't approve, but they're not here.
Fighters Guild. We defended Firsthold from the Daedra. We defend Nirn from their Anchors.
Nasty little Goblins. Disgusting creatures, in my opinion.
I'm going to seal this door and make sure you're not followed. \n\nI will meet you once you've dealt with Atarus. Good luck.
What? My mother, my aunt? Dead?\n\nThey were such boring, simple people. They would never have hurt … why?
Thank you. Now stand back, please.
When you're done, meet me at the top of the xanmeer. I know a few tricks that will get me past the swamp creatures, especially with you distracting them.\n\nI'm sorry I can't help you with the potions, but it's just too much for one person.
I must stay here to keep the Daedra back. Go to the Hist tree, near the center of Xal Ithix.\n\nDuring my trance, I saw what they did. Namira's minions placed a relic there. It poisons the swamp.
The fat-bastard ogrims dragged away my friends. We joined the Guild together.  It ain't right, them getting tortured by ogrims.\n\nYou rescue Sinfray, Borgath, and Vikord. I'll find Overseer Aruz and then you and me can deal with him, permanently.
Yes. This Shade that's assumed the form of the late Prince Naemon is behind this, but he's not here. And it's true, mysteries aside, we need to put the Blackroot clan back to rest, but the rangers are exhausted.\n\nAre you willing to help me?
Many things. The journal spoke of this place. But it also spoke of … terrible things. Things I wish I could unlearn. Prolonged contact with Molag Bal twisted her mind.
I'm here. Let's leave it at that.
Yes, but <<1>>'s death weighs heavily on Heita-Meen. She says she should've known. Poor thing, we were all fooled.\n\nBut enough of our troubles. Did you stop his imposter?
I am a servant of Meridia. Her master tactician and strategist.\n\nBetween my master's blessings and the time-distorting nature of this dread realm, I am still alive. Consider that your good fortune, for you will never defeat Molag Bal without my help.
Why look when you have found your new calling? Spikeball is the most exciting new sport in all of Tamriel! You will be hero to all!
Baandari are very special tribe of Khajiit. We lost our homeland many generations ago, so now we travel, not just in Elsweyr, but all over Tamriel. \n\nWe sell exotic goods you cannot find anywhere else. Ildani brings Baandari wares to Sentinel.
Report the extent of this attack to <<1>>. I expect to return with reinforcements quite soon. We'll drive the Dominion from <<A:2>>.\n\nIf you see opportunities to aid the keepers, I urge you to do so.
If you'd told me years ago that I'd do spellwork with Shalidor, I'd have called you a liar.\n\nI'm happy to do the work. It's the chance of a lifetime. But I can't help but feel I'm in over my head.
By the light of Jone and Jode, this is the craziest thing ever seen!\n\nEven Razum-dar would have lost his patience by now! If you think all this makes sense, then Hazazi is starting to wonder about you too!
Of course. You see, the culture of the Alik'r evolved around this ideal. \n\nMany of us today realize that exceptions must be made, but in my position, to ask my soldiers to strike down the dead would cause an outcry, and possibly lead to rebellion.
Simple. <<1>> wishes to stop the clawless High Elf who kills swamp-lizard babies and leaves Dominion-soldiers to die. And see Elsweyr again, maybe?\n\nIf <<1>> shows you how to remove seal on door, you splatter <<2>>. Deal?
Then the danger is graver than I thought. The <<1>> bears the memories of the Hist. Severing our link is the least they could do with it.\n\nCome, we must leave this place!
What's the matter? No stomach for blood? Do you weep at the sight of bones?
We have ears everywhere, Adept. An intelligence report fell into my hands that mentioned these tomes.
Thank you, but no. That amulet is meant for someone who patiently bears the brunt of this harsh land.
The warriors believe that the Hist tree must survive, no matter the torments it is forced to suffer. The crystal must continue to sustain it, to keep the spark of life flickering despite the endless pain.\n\nLife is precious. The Hist must endure.
<<1>> dragged me out of the water. He'll want to know <<2>> and the rest of the squad are all right. Think he said something about looking for shelter in a nearby cave, but I was still coughing up sand.
Let me answer your question with one of my own. Do you know of Dementia and Mania?
We need to combine our forces and find who murdered <<1>>. My squad and I need to pull his body out of that damned cave.\n\nWould you warn the sailors on that beached ship? They need to know it's not safe to wander around.
Not long ago, Rilis attempted to escape. We fought him, and though we contained him, he nearly won.\n\nAfterwards, the Keepers turned to the same Daedric magic that Rilis used to match his strength.
As soon as Sanodil gets the spell right and turns your friend into a queen. Assuming this works, you and Razum-dar should leave for the Imperial Underground straight away.\n\nOh. Here we go now. It's about time.
The pride of the Long Coast. We'll sail for the Dominion as long as they pay us to raid enemy shipping.
This one does not know and she does not want to know. <<1>> makes troublemakers and debtors disappear. Khaba is not so curious about their fate that  she would risk sharing it.
Excellent!  I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will earn you reputation in the guild. Walk with Julianos, my friend.
Oh, him. He left us in Daggerfall. Said he was going to strike out and start a cafe. Haven't seen him sense.\n\nDidn't care much for the man's taste in cooking. I imagine he's failed by now.
Aelif has a plan. Everything about what she proposed sickens me … but we are desperate. She believes Jofnir can find Colors, track her somehow, that they are linked. She also thinks … bah.
Indeed. Where is the Khajiit, Aelif?
I will find you near the Wood Elves' camp. I have ways of moving through the forest unseen. Can be dangerous, but worth the risk.\n\nI will do anything to get our children back.
<The skeleton hasn't been here for more than a few days. There are hundreds of small cuts and nicks on the bones.>\n\n<The faint smell of blood permeates the area.>
Be careful. Vullain is known as the Dread Vullain because rumors were that spirits wander there, and I never believed it. Now we get reports of the cursed army walking again, and given what's happened here…. Two Vinedusks were sent there to verify.
The Veiled Heritance has sent me to negotiate the problem of the Wilderking, if he exists at all. My orders are plain: convince him to aid us, or remove him.\n\nThe Shadow Watch should be very helpful in this regard.
I was out gathering fungi when the mist suddenly took on a strange hue. The next thing I remember is waking up in a dark place, surrounded by strange Bosmer with glowing eyes. They told me I'd be one of them soon. It's true. I can feel it.
You come prepared! Ambitious and resourceful. How refreshing!\n\nVery well. Have you a stage name?
It's a name, a title, and our holy city. Quite an honor to carry around such an important word, and the occasional burden in its confusion of outsiders.\n\nNot even <<Ac:1>> calls me by my given name. "Edhelorn" doesn't roll off the tongue, I suppose.
"Should she stay?" What kind of question is that? She's a cancer in our midst. I felt that darkness in my mind. She should be cut out! Now!
The Great Tree shields <<1>> from the winter winds and keeps our settlement shaded from the heat of the summer. Its story entwines with ours.
Thank you! The race is about to start!
I'm already suffering enough without you making a mockery of me. I just started thinking about my childhood now that my life is over, that's all. I liked those stories. Even if that's all they were. Children's tales.
As I promised, this door leads to the tower. I do not know what the tower holds, but we have heard the cries for help from within.\n\nBe careful in there, outsider. This is Coldharbour. Even the most mundane things can hide terrible dangers.
Have no fear. I am as alive as you are. Molag Bal has preserved me so that I can endure his endless tortures. His cruelty knows no bounds.\n\nI can't slip free of this lightless oubliette, but I have managed to send my projection to meet you.
As if this day hadn't gone to Oblivion already … you feel the need to remind me of all my debt?\n\nYes, I still owe S'rashi. The Dawn Posset is a quality ship; it'll take time to pay her off.
The Maormer have some ships waiting offshore. <<1>>'s people signaled them before <<Ac:2>> arrived. Some sort of invasion force.\n\nWith the Dominion's help, perhaps we can fortify the town. That alone may save many lives.
Arrogant Sea Elf pirates. To my recollection, they aren't known to raid <<1>>. Oh, and they have a thing for snakes.\n\nBut I'm sure we both have more important matters to attend. If you'd excuse me?
<<1>>. Though <<2>> heard it was a beautiful island, this one thinks it would look better without all the wrecked ships.\n\nNot even the Dominion's greatest fleet can sail through hurricanes. We are fortunate to be alive.
Excellent. Let the battle begin!
I hope I don't live to regret this.\n\nInril is the oldest member of the council. She's also the most willing to listen. But you have to show her some respect. Let her speak. Respond only when spoken to. That's all I can think of. Hope it helps.
Dealing with the council can be tricky. It's a collection of individuals, each with his or her own idiosyncrasies.\n\nThey are devoted to Molag Bal and our oath of servitude. It won't be easy to convince them to break those ancient promises.
You speak with confidence and conviction. Very well, I shall consider your words.\n\nA persistent fool may know more than an isolated genius. We shall see.
Do what you must, but I'm keeping this energy! It gives me the strength to move my sorry bones.\n\nNow, leave me to my sorrow.
I-I do not know. I never imagined this realm would be so … elaborate. How could he create this? Where does he get such power?\n\nWe have to stop this—whatever it takes. Perhaps we can find the source of it. Yes. We must.
Vanus divided himself to prevent them from using his considerable energy to power the Great Shackle. It didn't stop them from plugging this essence into the forge, however.\n\nUnlock the four seals and I'll be able to escape this damn machine.
Oh, little mortal, you amuse me so! \n\nSurely you have more important things to do than waste time with me? Aren't there rocks that need to be chipped or bugs to be swatted? Perhaps you need to mutter to yourself and wander around in circles?
Bright moons light your path, little one. You will find his house east of here up the hill. Good luck with those rats.
First, a question. Where did you come from?
Hazazi's tail swishes with joy.
Yes. There can be no doubt. The Withered Hand … we have never faced such a threat, but it is our duty to stop them.\n\nYou … you must become one of us, you must become an Ash'abah. Then you must stop the Withered Hand.
It's a shrine to Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of knowledge. They say if you stare into the fire, all will be revealed.\n\nBut without the ever-burning flame, there's no way to find the lost books.
Then that is a blessing. Once the books begin calling to you, there is little time before they ensnare you completely.\n\nBurn the books! Don't let their burden destroy you.
You are full of surprises! And to rest any fears you may possess, <<1>> will bring them to the scholars at <<Ac:2>>. This one will do nothing with the books until they are certain no dangers lie within.\n\nNot that knowledge can ever be dangerous.
By now they're either dead or turned. Vampires are not especially patient creatures. I pray that they're only dead but fear they have been turned. I beg you to help end this nightmare for them.
Very well. Then here it is. Go to the makhadda in the back of the tent and drink.\n\nBe prepared, initiate. The potion will bring on a vision of the past. When the vision is over, you will know what it means to be Ash'abah.
It was not this one that did those things. He … he remembers. The screams, the anger, the blood … Akkhuz-ri remembers. He was ridden, controlled, by an ancient evil. We call it the Dark Mane.
These tunnels just go on and on. And lots of them are trapped. \n\nYou can spot the triggers for the mechanical traps if you go slow and look closely. The trouble is, some of these traps are magical.
Really? You're not serious are you? Oh, may the spirits guide me through this dark hour.\n\nWell, we're about to find out what they thought. Here comes my father now.
King Fahara'jad, may Tava grant him eternal life, has made great contributions to the war effort. We Redguards are unparalleled in swordsmanship and grand strategy. Many of our most talented officers have already taken command of battalions overseas.
No agreement was reached. Some sided with you, others were not swayed, but we remain divided on what to do.\n\nWithout a clear decision, we must continue on the course we currently follow. We remain in the service of Molag Bal.
Yes! You did it. You really did it. I've tried for so long to convince them, and now we can finally leave this wretched place. I can look upon a real sky!\n\nWhat did my father tell you to do?
You mean did I just happen to be carrying one around? No. I found it with this text, and I'm proud to say I actually knew what it was!\n\nI've read a good bit about blood runes. Kind of a morbid fascination, I suppose.
By successfully completing the trials, you shall show your worth and skills to our factions. Then you may participate in the great debate that has fractured our community for so long.\n\nAre you ready to undertake these trials?
In the hands of these necromancers, the strength of the Ansei Wards is much weakened. With some magics, they might even be able to pervert the Wards' power for terrible ends.\n\nIt is good that we will soon have them back.
We are very different. Zur has learned much sharing a Dark Elf's mind. Few Khajiit experience such a wonder, yes? Gadris will do many great things, provided the unmelding works, and so will Zur. But this one would never choose himself over another.
This is our home, our refuge from the chaos of Cyrodiil. Acolytes retreat inside for rest and meditation, reflecting on the world and Akatosh's plan for it. Having folk like you stare at us through the windows would be distracting.
In my youth on the plains of Deshaan, I was taught to worship the Tribunal—the false gods Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil. I would have been lost to their unholy idolatry if not for a chance encounter with a priest of Akatosh.
I don't serve everyone for my health, scab. I've run this bar for years, and I'm not taking any guff from some shoreside soldier!\n\nNow that we've got that straight, what can I do for you?
No! No, wayfarer. Had I attacked one of my ancestors, I would not be standing here among them.
Then <<1>> learns to stand with allies rather than on his own. He shows me he is ready. With time and training, he will honor his ancestors.
No, we killed a husk. My father died long ago.
Of course there are! I trust you to get past them. Persuasion, bribery, intimidation … whatever it takes.\n\nI have some ideas on how you can approach them.
Driving off attackers is always the first step. Then repair kits can fix some of the damage, yes? Here is a practice repair kit for a siege weapon. Use it on a trebuchet, catapult, or ballista.\n\nWhen done, Taralin will speak with you.
My family won't have me. I stowed away on a merchant ship and it brought me here.\n\nAfter months fighting with <<1>> for crab meat in <<2>>, I heard about the temple.
In times of old, the carvings and adornments upon the walls would sing of the dance. Precious stones inlaid upon intricate plaques would speak to Masser and Secunda. \n\nTime has not been kind to these adornments … but still, they may speak to you.
Yes. Just a little nervous. Damned moon-sugar roiling my stomach. Hmm. It's this ceremony. Just irritating formality. Dull claws, let's get this over with. Ready?
This one isn't sure. The little Elf appeared out of nowhere, but at least she didn't try to kill Kamu like the other Elves did.\n\nThey both claim to know how to get inside the tower, but Kamu doesn't trust either one of them.
Ha! Oh yes! I'm sure King Fahara'jad would like that very much! \n\nFor Crowns and Forebears to settle our differences while he is in power, this would mean Fahara'jad's line would have everlasting legitimacy. I cannot support that.
The mead's in here, so no, not many. Besides, those creatures out there aren't very friendly. And some of them were once our friends and neighbors.\n\nOne day, though, Gamirth had had enough. Even his love for my daughter couldn't keep him here.
The Daedra scattered us soon after we got here. We need to find the others and close the portal before the Daedra organize.
He has been very … insistent on this expedition. I suspect that a mere "forest spirit" would not be worth the time of an entire group of mages, but you didn't hear me say it.
I think he keeps the souls nearby. He always comes and goes as he pleases. If you could destroy the Thane, our souls might return to us. Then we could leave this place.\n\nI think his lair is in one of the nice houses near the old well.
A Greenspeaker of Valenwood, from the Grahtwood. He has proven himself a thoughtful and sensitive mer, a good partner in this cultural exchange. He has taken this setback very hard.
Then you must be of the living.\n\nMy eyes are veiled. My time here draws to a close.
Yes, he can stay here in his precious tavern. Atone for his sins in solitude.  I don't think I can ever forgive him. \n\nI keep thinking of Gamirth. That note you gave me broke my heart. I … I want to leave this place.
She'll have those leaks fixed in no time. What else?
Fascinating ….\n\nCarindon is still speaking with our captive Bosmer but I will join you to investigate this. We should be careful. Too many have answered Aetherius' call today.
Heard he used to be a pirate. Got his ship by ambushing a captain and cutting his throat in cold blood. Then he claimed the title of captain for himself and made it stick.
Hmm? Oh, that was Ezreba. She's a good friend of Bowenas, my wife. She was so nice, she was asking me how Bowenas is.
He's right about that. He mentioned it offhand before he left for Rawl'kha. I didn't think much of it, just figured he was drinking again.\n\nBut now … did you see that spirit thing? Are those things inside my neighbors?
That's why I need your council, my new friend. Ezreba has been instrumental in Greenhill's success. The town would not be what it is today without her. I … do not know what to do.
You have no idea how grateful I am to hear you say that. I'll ensure Ezbeba buries every single person who fell today. And she will work with Halindor to seal the catacombs beneath the temple.\n\nBut we will ensure she has a future here.
If what Cadwell says is true, our job isn't finished here. And I'm positive we got the Daedric Prince's attention at the Shackle. He won't be too happy about what we did to his toys.\n\nThat means we need to hit him before he hits us.
That's not who we are! We're raiders, folks who find rich people and steal their stuff. "Building something" is for suckers, the types we raid. Our Mom would be so ashamed if she could hear Klovag speak like that.
Curse him and the bowl of mountain bear hash he calls a brain. Did the fool say why he's not coming to help his brother hit the richest target ever?
What? An Orc's not allowed in the Hall?  I didn't see a sign. Piss off.
There was a time when Shuzura knew every plot, every rumor, every story within her village. Now … she cannot even banish a scoundrel like Rakhad. Thank you. Please, speak to Tazia. She … she'll offer you some coin for your service.
I don't know, but somehow, it seems like that's what I was meant to do all along. When he burned the forest, I actually felt its pain. I think I'm … connected to this place.\n\nI can't fight Andur though—he's too strong. Will you help me?
The Grand Warlord has much on his mind; be grateful for a few minutes of his time.\n\nTo me come Grand Warlord Zimmeron's orders. These I post to the boards that flank me. Which should we discuss?
It's the light, it's very bright, my eyes have been watering… that's all it is.
I don't think you do. Now if you'll excuse me?
He has corrupted one of the Ansei Wards, and he's using some kind of necromantic focuses to channel energy from the the dead for a ritual he's conducting in the lighthouse. \n\nHe says this ritual will make him a lich. Will you help me stop him?
I urge you to reconsider. You do him no favors by giving him this blade.\n\nYou know the curse it bears. Anyone who carries the sword will be attacked by those tortured spirits. Only the dishonored one is not so bound.
I hope so, for everyone's sake. If you want a siege weapon of your own, you can buy them from siege merchants at our gates and keeps.
I suspect it has something to do with Alasan's plan to become a lich. \n\nIf this is where the Ansei was born, perhaps Alasan had to bring the Ward here in order to corrupt it. That's just my theory, of course.
The mage's tent has some papers and personal items inside. Perhaps you could look to see if anything there might explain this delay? And, hmm. Perhaps Alanya may be able to suggest what to look for.
Now I know you lie, for he's been dead for almost a century! Yet, the legends never did speak of his death ….\n\nSep take you! I won't hear another word! Begone, and I will wait for <<1>> to tell me the truth of it!
Our foes' forts and resources must be taken. Fort walls or gates must be smashed down for us to reach the heart of the enemy stronghold. The defenders must be defeated and our banner raised on the flagpole. \n\nEasy to say, harder to do.
You've come to the right man, mate. I've been with <<1>> longer than anyone—I was part of the group that helped him take his first ship.
Why didn't you say so? I thought you were another sand-eater come to fight for the Alik'r.\n\n<<1>> is a great man, but he has a tragic history. It's given him a gruff exterior, but his bully-boys would follow him anywhere.
He's not? We should rejoice then! That bastard! I relish the knowledge of his defeat.\n\nWithout him, the rest of these necromancers do not concern me. Not in the least. But what of the Ansei Ward? Do you have it?
Based on our own experience, it appears that merging two souls into one vessel causes an internal storm as the souls vie for control. It takes all of our mental fortitude to maintain our individual personalities.
Then nature takes its course. But at least we will have tried to beat this. At least one of us has a chance to survive. And know that however this ends, I am grateful for the aid you have provided us.
Stick around and see. A day when I don't hear complaints from ten people is a good one. And everyone's always asking me for things to do. Sometimes, I just send people out on dangerous jobs hoping they never come back.
I'm as ready as I'm going to get. This just makes me so angry! Why in Mauloch's name would somebody want to steal an entire world? It makes no sense!\n\nNow look what you did. I'm just furious and I need something to hit.
Me? Really? I'd be honored.\n\nBut I think you'd be better served with a fighter type right now. I'm sure we'll meet up somewhere along the way, though. I won't let the people of Nirn down.
Oh, you know. Working as hard as I can to keep him alive. Making sure the new students don't hear about past expeditions. The usual.
Varen wants to assemble a new group of companions in the vein of the original five. Claims it fulfills a prophecy in those wretched scrolls of his. \n\nSuperstitious nonsense, but he is quite correct on one point: we need to find Sai Sahan.
Yes, well, I'm in a bind. I'm considering potential grooms for <<1>>, but she refuses to talk to me. I have to know what she wants in a husband, or <<2>>, who hired me, won't gather the dowry.\n\nSo I need you to talk to her.
Generally speaking, I'm sure they are, but I'm more concerned about the Withered Hand.\n\nThose evil bastards won't rest until they've killed every last one of us. We can't fight the Imperials if we're all dead.
Bah! We usually win. There's nothing about our behavior if we lose.\n\nYou've made mortal enemies with the Ungodly. Leave our camp, if you can. But we will never back down.
The mercenaries hid harpy eggs around Kozanset. Naturally, the harpies want the eggs back. That's the root of the town's harpy trouble. We must find and return their eggs so one problem's solved.\n\nBut first, follow me upstairs.
Now we know her true nature, we can be prepared for anything.\n\nThe masters teach us to recognize danger. She is dangerous, yes, but not such that we should cast her aside. We can help her, and she can still help us.
I don't know. The change was not instantaneous—it was wild, fast, brutal. The Wood Orcs were unrecognizable when she was done.\n\nBut she's my wife. I can't let her suffer.
The entrance to the temple is below, in the rift formed when the Mane tore at the ground. Find Khali and see what you can do. Shazah will do what she can to aid the soldiers here before she follows.
That's right, mate. <<1>> had a grudge against this Captain Kroner. So he goes around and gets together a small gang of boys who are sharp with a blade and none too nice about it. We join the crew, he kills this Kroner, and we take over the ship.
Life for an Arch-Mage is measured in decades, not years. The rituals I performed extended my life, allowed me to continue my work … but eventually even I began to slow down.
I got word from the scouts they were also making for Fort Grimwatch, to the west. Had to let them pass. And I think one of their cohorts went south towards Vinedusk. Moons luck to them down there. Those Bosmer are crazy.
As I said, I'm not a murderer by choice. And I want someone to know it.\n\nI appreciate your help with all this. Now go! Atarus is just up ahead.
No! The circlet is an abomination. It must be shattered, destroyed. Razum-dar's duty here is clear. The circlet cannot be allowed to leave the vault.
<The marine's body is covered in wounds—sword slashes, broken bones, and even a few fang marks.>
It brings me some unease to admit, but I think you're right. And I believe I know just what service she can offer. If you will, comrade, attend me at my side. We have some matters to discuss.
We don't need any more bloodshed. If there's a way we can end this without fighting, we must.\n\nI have an idea. Find my father. Ask that harpy out there to get you to town. I'll be behind you.
The giant lizards with lightning in their teeth are wamasu. <<1>> laid their eggs and nurtured them to hatching. Everything about her is twice their size.\n\nIt pains me to say, but you'll need to put her down when you kill <<2>>.
I can't say for certain. It's one of two things, neither of which is good for anyone on this island. You don't stoop to blood sacrifice unless you need a lot of energy very quickly.\n\nAnd, well, to release it just as quickly.
I've no idea, but we need to restore goodwill with our flying neighbors. Even my father is in there to negotiate the mercenaries' departure.\n\nThey should be out soon. The villagers, I mean. They want to cast <<1>> from the town themselves.
Certainly. Once you've found the documents Cari is looking for, she'll be able to choose a time and place to strike. You and she will knock him out, bundle him back here … and we'll get him to confess everything to his troops.
I ask for honest, you give me reedish-, redic-, silly. Can't you see? The colors, the beauty. Look beyond the canvas to the … things beyond.\n\nBah, you are too much for it. It will never understand you. I think. What?
Patience, my lovely. First you must enter the qualifying rounds and defeat all three contenders. Only then will the main arena crowds be able to feast their eyes upon your dazzling smile.
<<1>> sustains <<c:2>>. Thus has it always been, with every pair. I am not long for this world.\n\nI believe I'll find the Maormer's home island. Before my beloved pulls me back to the Green,  I'll drown them in a tide of Mara's tears.
What do you mean? You told him about our baby and he's not coming to get me?
There are people killing each other all over town! Soldiers stabbing townfolk, buildings burning, rebels bashing soldiers, everyone mad all the time. It's no place to raise a child, let me tell you.
I made him go. The Imperials were on to him. I saw them watching him, following him around. I convinced him to get out of town, beyond the soldiers' reach. Now that we've fought the Imperials to a standstill, we needed him again.
Months ago. I don't know, really. The Juncus family always kept to itself, and the cult might have been killing everyone who came near for months until someone finally made it into town to warn us.
Why? Should the students not know the truth?
Yes. Vanus Galerion of the Mages Guild requested your presence. He should be here soon.
Oh, Dremora … something, something. You can ask him yourself, he's right upstairs. For a king, he mumbles a lot.\n\nLovely crown he's got, though. Rather dashing, isn't it? I wonder where I can get one of those.
I'd say this is a perverted case. The value that Malgoth placed on his bow alone may be enough for him to want it back. Or, he may be using the Right of Theft as a more honorable justification for his new servitude. There was fear in his voice.
She comes and goes as she pleases. This is a wild creature, after all. I do not even name her, for she isn't mine.
What can I tell you that you don't already know? Vanus Galerion is the most famous, most powerful, most daringly courageous mage in the Mages Guild.\n\nHis legendary exploits are … well, legendary!
You have already encountered the cult, and their dark thralls. The cult, in their ignorance, tear at the temple walls. They want to enter the inner sanctum, overcome the wards and claim the Claw. Fools.
I hate everybody. I'm a misanthrope, not a traitor. \n\nListen, I can be a pain in the arse, but I'm a good soldier. I'd never betray the Pact. One of those two whining idiots has to be your man.
As you should. I just hope what you think is right is what's best for my tribe.
Hah, yes! In ancient times it was huge, made of the braids of every Khajiit to worship the Bright Moons. The Mane had to be carted around on a palanquin to make appearances. The modern headdress is much more … manageable.
Harpies. Those accursed creatures tore my inn to pieces. This inn has been in my family for three generations. These bed frames, pillows, and carpets … this is our heritage. Years of memories, torn asunder in a moment.
It is a larger … more powerful … version of a Dark Anchor ….\n\nDesigned to complete the connection … to draw Oblivion and Nirn … together ….
Once you get through the rubble, look for my notes. They list the components you need to find to craft the rods. \n\nZur and I will meet you inside. We'll keep hidden as best we can. This damnable weakness is so annoying.
Ah, how delicious! Simply a turn of phrase, I assure you.\n\nThe Redguard held much bitter fear in his taste before. I will weave him a life better suited for sweetness. My children do love a treat now and then.
Well, Darien ran east and Walks-in-Ash ran west, so I imagine that tells us something.\n\nNow, stop standing around and move out! Those reinforcements are slaughtering us!
Very perceptive! Yes, my revenge on the Altmer is well at hand.  Your theft and the guards clumsily following you are minor setbacks.
Tharn. You can be sure of that. It wasn't enough that he inflicted the Dark Mane upon Akkhuz-ri, or spurred the Colovians to assault Arenthia. Now he must work to shatter the jewel in the desert. Our great city of Dune.
I knew you'd ask that, and of course, I feel like a fool. She was standing right behind us at Tava's Blessing, for Mara's sake! \n\nAfter we parted ways, I was racking my brain trying to remember her name, but it just didn't come to me.
You cannot hope to succeed without the support of your allies. I will summon those who still live and draw them into the vortex with us.
So, it begins! Destroy the remaining anchors. I shall begin searching for the focal point of the vortex.
It's the right thing to do. For us and them.\n\nI'll be waiting in the town square for you, if you're willing. What do you say?
"Conquerors" is a strong word, but yes, of course they were. Ha! Our ancestors and the Bretons' laid siege to the city for thirty years before finally breaching the walls and razing the city. The Orcs proved to be fearsome adversaries.
Since Second Seed. The races were interesting when he first started, but the best lizard died, and without <<1>>'s help, no one will sell <<2>> good stock.\n\nStill, I've made a lot of money. I lose sometimes, but I win more than I lose.
Yes. That is likely. General Thoda is my chief military advisor. He is also a practical man who places security above superstition. \n\nHe is resting at his home after returning from Alcaire, but I need his counsel on how to proceed.
I need to link the spell with the Atronachs. Cores … destroy the creatures, and get me a core of each element type. And … agh … hurry!
May I see that? This … this is my great-grandmother's instrument. She was one of the greatest bards of the frontier in her day. It's said she performed for kings and queens, and always had time for the common folk alike.
Docents earn reputation by bringing in rare texts for study. And so as your reputation grows, so too do your rewards swell like the belly of a netch in the sun.\n\nAre you interested in joining the Mages Guild, sera?
We've been preparing the new recruits for the next anchor raid. \n\nGuildmaster Sees-All-Colors has issued orders to dismantle and disrupt the anchors whenever one comes to our attention.
No, I go into the church or manor to get food and to sleep. If Grigerda's awake, I usually go to the church; Hjorik's too busy to bother me much. Good advice for you, if you plan on sticking around here for a while.
Where else would I be? As I said earlier, Bruma will be won or lost out here, not inside the church or manor. Let the wounded stay inside; the warriors are out here.
Good thinking. Whatever we can do to speed this up. In fact, as soon as you find each keystone, bring it here before searching for the others.\n\nThat will help me puzzle this out more quickly.
You'll know soon. Now, I tipped off the guards that the Artisan was in the bank, and here you are sneaking about. I advise you leave.
Oh, yes. For the Mages Guild. We're scholars by trade. Dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. Members seek out books, tomes, and ancient scrolls in their travels. We aid each other as we can, and provide magical aid for any that would ask our help.
Enormous chains that descend from the sky! Passages to Oblivion burst open, and Daedra boil out to lay waste to the countryside. I don't know who started calling them Daedric Anchors, but Mauloch knows it fits.
Come with you? You mean leave Coldharbour? Well, I don't know. It's been a very long time since I've seen the world I left behind.\n\nDo you think it's wise?
This one has always enjoyed trying new and different things. But this situation? It is very strange, very awkward.\n\nIs that thought me-Zur or me-Gadris? This one can never be certain where his thoughts end and Gadris's begin. Very confusing, yes?
What a silly question! That's like asking if I prefer food to water. Both are necessary to life as we know it.\n\nThat said, I always get a little thrill when I see a mage cast a spell. It's so exciting!
Absolutely not. This entire tribe was enslaved by Dark Elves. They have more reason to hate the Ebonheart Pact than you or I.\n\nBut someone in <<1>> decides to set an example, and now there are barricades. It's why I need outside help.
Beyond this door waits the Great Mooring, which connects the Great Shackle from Coldharbour to Nirn.\n\nDefend me and I will use my considerable skills and power to destroy the Shackle and end the Planemeld, once again proving my magnificence.
Oh yes. It's Coldharbour's most nefarious prison. The Daedra in the Halls of Torment reach deep into the dark places of a prisoner's mind and torture them with apparitions of the things they most dread.
Not much. I heard them say they would bring me to "the Obsidian Husk" to bestow their blessing.\n\nNo clue what that is, but more of my captured Guildmates are up ahead. They may know more.
He is here to help, as always! You may have noticed your new friend Fasion lies dead on the ground behind you. Raz knew Fasion well. As he thought he did Astanya.
Well done. I will begin searching for a safe route to the Halls of Torment immediately.
Hmm. I could tell you, but how do I know you're trustworthy? You ask us to share your enemies, but will you share ours?\n\nThe Wood Orcs are a plague we can't seem to be rid of. If you help us drive them off, I'll tell you what you want to know.
The Hallowed is kind of like a guide, or guardian. When all is well with my people, the new Mane is chosen easily. Peacefully. But sometimes things are not so easy on the plains of Elsweyr.
The where varies. Any city with a large temple to the Dance may act as a trail to the Path. Dune would be the only one in the March. As to what it is … it changes, depending on the walker. It is different for every person.
The Mane must eventually walk the Two Moons Path. Always. It is hard, coaching someone. Making that journey. Perhaps impossible. The Moon Hallowed is the guide for the Mane along that journey.
Praise the gods! It would not be proper if we were not present when father makes his speech. \n\nHe is very likely starting to worry about us himself.
As you say! I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will now earn you reputation in the guild. Good luck!
We can teach you unique techniques only available to members, and provide access to special spells and abilities. And from time to time projects crop up for those with an adventuresome spirit. You may end up working with Guildmaster Vanus himself!
As you say! I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will now earn you reputation in the guild. Good luck!
We want you to join us as our fifth member. You are the champion we should have had with us back then.\n\nDon't look so grave. This is largely symbolic. But, please … humor an old soldier.
I think I dropped it in the tower where I worked.\n\nI … I was very proud the day my father passed the Badge of Office to me. My family has served Crestshade for generations. My father, my grandmother before him. It means a lot to me.
What's most important to an old scholar like me? My mind, I suppose.\n\nThe bloodfiends tore my body apart after using some of my flesh to create their abomination. My skull was tossed aside. It's got to be somewhere in the graveyard.
And it probably was. The man I spoke to was no Khajiit, though that is all I can say about him. He was hidden from view when we first spoke, his voice muffled.\n\nI refused to take his gold, but I knew sooner or later someone would.
Traveling is a humbling experience. You see firsthand what a small place you occupy in the world. Funny thing is, the farther you go, the harder it is to return. But when you do … if you do … you get to see the place you came from with new eyes.
The Wood Elves of Falinesti feared our fading bones would wander, so they sought us out and carried us to <<Ac:1>>. Here they interred us beneath shrines to Y'ffre, ensuring we would never be forgotten.\n\nBecause of this, none of us can die.
Thinking, considering, creating. How is one to work in a crowded city? The noise and interruptions drive away all thought, destroy all creativity. At least this is true for Whickmuz, thus you find him here.
Nothing other than the multitude of Dremora sitting on top of them! I could handle this myself, but I didn't want to make the rest of the troops sad by showing off my awesome battle skills.\n\nBut, you, on the other hand. They're used to that from you.
Then if fate is to be believed, the winds are ready as well.\n\nRun quickly, my friend … or do not … either way we will have our answer.
It's just …. What I mean is, I can't bear to lose him. We won't be able to bear it! He's so excited, and it's such a great honor, but he doesn't know what it will cost our family!
I am most grateful for this kindness.\n\nTake the items to the far end of the graveyard. There, you should be able to find a suitable space to bury our effects in hallowed ground. I will meet you there.
Did he? What surprisingly good advice. Titanborn and I are more likely to kill each other than we are to help.\n\nThe choice is yours, but I recommend choosing brains over brawn. I have valuable knowledge of the Daedra. And don't forget, I'm the mage.
Tharn was always mocking Sai. Making jokes at his expense. Sai never responded, but I know it hurt him deeply. The Daedra must have sensed that.\n\nOn the plus side, a doppelganger with Tharn's face was much more satisfying to kill.
Oh, there's not much to say. Dull as a rusty dagger, me! If I told you about myself, I'd put you to sleep.\n\nAnd with all these Wormies about? They'd turn you into a skeleton! We'd make quite the pair then, wouldn't we?
I've read accounts of these foul artifacts. Molag Bal uses them to enslave large communities and to empower specific parts of his divine portfolio.\n\nIn this case, I believe the Heart is greatly increasing the rate at which the vampirism spreads.
Tell me then, is it madness that drives you to barge in here like this? \n\nOr perhaps you're here to surrender on behalf of your people? If that's the case, I accept.
Shazah was always telling me stories … I never thought I'd see this place. It's the Plane of Jode, Hallowed! The place where the Bright Moons dwell, the home of the gods. It's … different than I expected in some ways. But that makes sense.
To Mournhold, where Skald-King Jorunn is waiting for us. I'm given to understand that his palace is inaccessible at present, and for a variety of reasons the Tribunal Temple is … inappropriate.\n\nHe's offered to meet us at the guild plaza. Shall we?
Sending people to a mine? By Morwha's left teat, why would I do that? Is there … um … is there gold there?
Dreadful! Well … all this talk of snakes and mines—it is exhausting. I'll just be going now. I have a long day of work tomorrow. Lifting things … you know, carrying them. That sort of thing. It has been a pleasure speaking with you!
Yes. King Dynar and our forces are preparing to attack the Reaver Citadel to the north.\n\nAnd on my way to find you, I noticed a strange shipyard to the east and a Redguard settlement to the west.
Not quite, but soon. He's waiting for you and a few of the others to meet up with him. They're gathering on the land bridge just to the north.\n\nI'm going to head in that direction as soon as we're done here.
Yes! I was cruely born without a tail, without claws, but I know where I belong. If I can just find the right mixture, I can fix that.\n\nThen all those fools in Mournhold will see that they were wrong!
And she may have been sent to provide false information. To lead us blindly into an ambush—or worse!\n\nNo, we shall not deal with Dremora, especially in this place. I ordered one of the fighters to keep an eye on that one.
Go to the Tiger's shrine. Pray at the brazier and receive the blessing of Brackenleaf's Briars. Then return to me for the final rite of initiation.
Little details. Making sure the right agents are in the right places. Protecting Pact interests. That sort of thing.\n\nI could tell you more, but then Naryu would want to kill you. Or maybe just cut on you a little.
You must lead the Five Companions into this final battle. We are, all of us, prepared to sacrifice our lives to see this through to the end.\n\nOur plan is to use the Amulet of Kings to invest you with the power to do battle with the Daedric Prince.
It helps me. Keeps him busy so I can read in peace. Makes it all worthwhile.
About time. I've put off leaving Evermore for weeks waiting for this. Of course, they'd put me in the stocks if I came back without it. \n\nWhether it's Clan Agluk or Clan Morkul could change the course of history.
She told us recovering relics was of great import to the Dominion.\n\nI didn't ask questions, but I think it has something to do with <<1>>. Something's going on there, something political. I think the general wants to get out in front of it.
Ah, Renoit sent you then! He need not wait outside any longer—Draven will soon be inducted into the village. I'll see to it the guard lets him know.\n\nIs that all you seek, then?
We snarl over the hollow bones of an ancient carcass, like a pack of wild dogs come upon a dessicated corpse in the desert. Cyrodiil has been consumed from within by demons of Oblivion. I will fight no more for the diseased remains of an empire.
I was a scout for the Imperial army, one of the best. Out of the ones who hadn't been eaten or torn to pieces, that is. I saw too many of my friends die in there, at the hands of monsters. I'm never going back.
They were a legendary group of Redguard swordmasters, wiped out in the First Era by the Yokudan Emperor Hira.\n\nSahan spent years trying to resurrect their ancient traditions, but failed utterly. He considered it his greatest failure.
With a blinding light, brighter than any I've ever seen. Then I'm in a room where everything's illuminated. As if the world itself is made of light. I'm … alone.\n\nAnd then I wake up. It's always the same.
Meet Aelif on the outskirts of the Trading Post. We will journey to Ragnthar together.
Keep out of sight. They wouldn't even allow me to watch, so I doubt you'd be welcome there without your robes.\n\nIf you hurry, you can make it before they arrive. Make sure they don't hurt Draven!
Damn right I'm determined! And more than a little irritated at all this! Come on, hero, let's show Molag Bal how it's done!\n\nThen I can get back to the ordinary craziness I usually get to deal with.
Hah, a fighter after my own heart! I return to you this storied weapon in the form of your choosing, then: a greatsword. May it strike hard and true, in service to the Guild and all we protect.
Do you have a favorite tavern? Hah! Right now, my friend, I will rest. What comes tomorrow comes then, and only Stendarr knows what challenges we'll face. For now, I will talk to the council. And plan for that tomorrow.
Tand came here … he thought he could win money enough to open a tavern. Make his father and his Sind proud. Before this one knew what was happening, he was dragged off by Hadran and his strongmen. They said they would sell this one to slavers!
One can witness the larger view from on high, but one must come down below to see what hides in shadows.
Oh, of course. Glarikha told me. I hope you'll forgive her. Her intentions are good, but she misled you—that request was not on my behalf. \n\nShe can't seem to accept my decision to step aside and let Duke Renchant handle all matters of state.
When he is able, Nethrin and Felari will return to his home forest. We will return the bones of the Wood Elves, and the relics, and hopefully bring closure to these long-ago tales. From the past comes hope for the future, yes?
Thank you. This will help my wounded arm. The vampires … they attacked without warning.\n\nWe lost a lot of good people today.
I can feel the earth. I can taste the wind. It's like every piece of this forest is a part of me. I will remain here, a part of these woods forever!\n\nCould I even command the beasts? It seems that it would be a trivial matter!
He is. The queen stepped aside, but she remains the rightful ruler of the kingdom and she still cares deeply for its people.\n\nEven now, in mourning, she attends to wounded soldiers and refugees in the chapel. But she has other concerns as well.
The Spearhead has done well against the Dominion. The king has seen fit to grant me a larger command.\n\nThe Spearhead now prowls with the Talonclaw, Leki's Grace, and the Black Revenant.
I'm sailing the seas, fighting alongside Kaleen. I wouldn't have it any other way. Cutpurse to cabin girl to First Mate in as many years. It's like a dream.\n\nI wish you were with us. What you did in Rivenspire was incredible.
We're both doing well. No matter what happens tomorrow, I'm doing what I was born to do.\n\nKaleen trusted me enough to make me her first mate. I'm not going to let her down. Not ever.
Just like you did back on Stros M'Kai. That was a fun time, wasn't it?\n\nI'm glad you're here. I really am. Have one last drink with me. Once my ship is back on the open sea, I don't know when I'll be back.
Quite well. Kaleen has taken Nicolene as her first mate, and I believe the arrangement suits them.\n\nThey complement each other. They trust each other. This bodes well for a successful voyage.
She's doing Mara's good work, my child. Queen Arzhela has a warm heart that finds no comfort in the palace. She came here shortly after the death of the king to aid us with the sick and the poor.
Yes, the rest of my comrades stand atop the walls of Bangkorai Garrison. Only I and a few others are left to watch over the chapel.
Me? I'll chase Mannimarco to the furthest corners of Oblivion if I have to. Vengeance is a powerful motivator. \n\nAnd I don't know if you've realized it yet, but under this hardened shell, I'm an optimistic fool who'd take a blade for any one of you.
A famous High Elf general … or infamous, depending on who you ask. Her Jade Dragoons are well respected, but she has an aggressive reputation.\n\nThe last I heard, she was in <<1>>.
Not even a little bit. This one time, I had twelve toads in one of my kegs….
Bah. To me it's like some uncle I never met died and left me out of his will. No big deal, see?
We'll be in position above the parley site. If the Imperials try anything, we'll make sure they regret it. The three of us can cast spells to rain down fire, ice, lightning—we have it all.\n\nYou'll just need to tell us where to target our spells.
A wise decision! I hereby grant you the rank of Student in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereto. \n\nEvery book acquired, or collection of books completed, will now earn you status within the guild. Good luck!
With the city in such dire straits, the queen is determined to avoid controversy. If people heard she was inquiring as to the state of the city's defenses, there would be an uproar. \n\nIf you conduct the inquiries, however, it can be more discreet.
You swore you would free me!\n\nForgive me. The promise of freedom ruins my manners. You should do what you must, and what you are willing. I will not press you to betray who you are, not on my account.
He didn't know anyone here, that I know of. Who could he possibly trust enough to lower his guard?
What now? For you, it seems there's more to do. For us ….\n\nWe've seen too much, my friend. Been through too much. I think it's time for us to go.
Not … not here. I can show you way out. Make sure Goblins … leave you alone.\n\nFollow me … ack!
Enormous chains descend from the sky! A passage opens to Oblivion, and Daedra boil out to lay waste to the countryside. I don't know who started calling them Daedric Anchors, but Mauloch knows it fits.
I'm fine. I'm dead—but fine otherwise.\n\nI take it you're looking for a way out? The Architect never allows those who wander in to just leave.
None of your business. And before you get any ideas, you should know this garden is for aesthetic purposes only.\n\nNow please leave.
Quickly then! Let me mix it into a poultice.\n\nI am grateful that you were able to find the pure heartwood.
Agreed. But we need to draw him out. Otherwise he'll order the mutineers to kill my crew.\n\nAnd if he sees my face, <<1>> is as good as dead. We have to be smart about this.
It is the Fell Watch, it has to be. Why else would they take over the Inn? This isn't an invasion.
Oh, no. I can't leave my home until it's entirely clean.\n\nBesides, the mayor said none of us can leave, and we all know what happens when we don't listen to the mayor.
Dominion? <<1>> is no longer part of the Dominion. The mayor decreed it.\n\nIf Dominion scouts marched their muddy boots onto our streets, we'd truss them all up!
Really? Maybe he's right—talking about an undead army. But if this is his army, why are they hostile?\n\nWe might have to earn their allegiance. Have you seen these blue flames in the ruins? I think they're somehow inciting the undead to violence.
Hmm. Maybe you are less interested when you hear what we do?\n\nYou are familiar with the custom of property ownership, yes? I have a thing, it is mine! You take it, it is still mine, yes? Why? Because I did not give it to you.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. I've been using that foot as a crutch for too long. Thanks.\n\n… But seriously, if you do see a loose squirrel foot, let me know. I'd like to, you know, bury it or something.
Don't tell me you've never borrowed anything without permission.\n\nI've always been free-spirited, otherwise I'd be in a stronghold somewhere living like some toothless villager!
We must find him. The ritual might still work if we catch him in time to complete the binding.\n\nIf not, then we must save the town, above all else.
I cannot say. Physically, I am unharmed. But mentally …?\n\nI feel a darkness in my heart. A weight on my soul. I do not know how long this emptiness will remain.
Rather cautiously, I expect. \n\nWatch your step, hold your nose, and do mind the traps. There'll like as not be a fair dose of running and skull-bashing as well.
I've heard of a remedy for skooma sickness, but it requires skill to prepare. I'm no alchemist, and I can't afford the mixture.\n\nSo I sit by his side and stroke his fur and purr reassuringly into his ear, praying he makes it through the night.
My sisters and I believe in balance. For each life taken, a new one is given, in one form or another. We do not waste what we acquire, and we ask before taking.\n\nAnd for this simplicity, we are reviled. The woods are simple, as are we.
We did what we had to. His works ruined me and I had to take him down. Listen, I know it was wrong but I did what I thought I had to. I'm sorry now. I'm sorry that it drove him to this.
Closer than you might think. You want to meet them?
I thought as much—though I am surprised you would admit it. An honest thief. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, tell me. Why have you come?
I did everything in my power to protect him. If I could've taken the death-blow on the battlefield, I would've done it without hesitation.\n\nHe should've been king.
Not really.
Have you ever seen a goddess cry? It is a terrible thing to behold … so perfect a face, marred by so many tears.\n\nAlmalexia's tears for Gil-Var-Delle crystallized into a beautiful gem, filled with all her fury directed at the Harvester of Souls.
Pelidil, the Maormer, and … the sea serpent, yes? Hah, this one wishes he had been along for that fun. So it always goes, the Eyes must do what must be done. They do not get to choose what fun they have.
You don't know him.\n\nHe only acknowledges me when I'm doing something wrong. He calls me Isabeth the Impatient. Isabeth the Ignorant. Since I disobeyed orders, I bet he's got plenty to say about me today.
Of course, my friend. We can hold the door a few minutes more. What did you want to discuss?
It always does, my friend, it always does.\n\nArkay will lead us to victory this day. Of that, I have no doubt.
Good. That makes me feel even more confident about this. Khalisah knows me better than anyone else. If she thinks this is the right thing, then it must be so.\n\nJust one more favor, my friend. Will you take the necklace to Guendeline for me?
The relic is a vessel. It barely contains the power within it. Damaging the vessel will unleash its power—sending a wave of corruption to cover the land.\n\nThe blood-curse was but a taste of what will befall your people if the relic is destroyed.
The relic cannot be destroyed. If that is your quest, you have already failed. The vampire knows this. As does the one now controlling the relic.\n\nIf you try to destroy the relic, you will only unleash its power.
This one will help you get revenge!
There are evil devices planted in the earth. The Worm Cultists call them Fangs of Chaos. They seem to be channeling the residual magic from Molag Bal's presence into the Anchor. \n\nArys tried to destroy one, but it killed him the instant he hit it.
Breagha-Fin. A Nord settlement, from what Lady Laurent told me.\n\nExiles, you know. Got into trouble for performing unnatural rituals back in Skyrim and were banished. Of course, I haven't seen a single Nord out here, so make of that what you will.
Disorientation is understandable.\n\nSomehow, when I joined the ritual, I altered the power of the relic. I turned Leila into a monster. I had to kill her. And Montclair and the others … they became vampires imbued with the power of the relic.
I have Gwendis to thank for that. She pulled me out of there before Montclair and the others were fully recovered.\n\nNow Montclair claims he wants to end death and suffering. That he wants to take the throne of Ranser. And it's all my fault.
I don't want anyone telling me where to sleep, when to eat, who to fight or how to live my life. I want to be free and I want to make loads of money.
I won't head up there until I see that my sister is safe. They're holed up in the Orc's Finger Ruins now.\n\nIt's exciting, isn't it? Breathe that air, friend. It smells like freedom and fortune.
It provides protection to local farms in exchange for a modest fee. The farms are plagued with all sorts of problems, you see. If they don't pay us, then there's a good chance that some thugs might show up and burn their farms down.
Because the ring is very valuable, of course. Jurak-dar has a very lucrative buyer lined up in the town of Pa'alat. Very respectable, and willing to pay top coin. You have retrieved the ring, so Jurak will cut you in!
She did? That's different, then. Show me her orders and I'll stand aside.
Then I can't let you inside. Her instructions were very specific—no one gets in without her written permission. I'm to remain at my post until relieved.\n\nExcept in an emergency, of course.
Montclair's forces tried to assault our camp. We held them off, though. Our mages put up some wards, so they should be fine without us.\n\nSkordo and I decided to come lend a hand.
Because I need to take this relic out of this realm. It needs to be transported to a place where it can't do any harm.\n\nI have made a deal with my master. Molag Bal has agreed to take me and the relic to Coldharbour.
Ah, clever and loyal. A rare combination. Very well, I prefer not to have the Thalmor looking over my shoulder anyhow.\n\nInstead, we will invest in Jode's Chariot! Our coffers still need guarding, yes?
Now, wait a second! Are you with the City Watch? Listen, I'm out of that line of work!\n\nYou want to arrest somebody, that Imperial's your man. I saw him slip into a house right by the south gate, with another shady-looking character. Arrest them!
Where do you think all these … ack! … Goblins came from? Malofar betrayed them and turned them into a Goblin army!
Look how the relic responds to our runestones. Maybe if we use both of them at the same time, the release of energy might destroy the relic.
Believe it or not, I think I actually remember the way back! That's all I remember though …. Except the fact that Lorelia needs me!
Oh, good. Nothing I enjoy more than talk of conspiracy. Did the ambassador have a manifesto? They usually have manifestos.\n\nNo matter. I trust you resolved it?
Yes! Did Klaandor send you? Where is he? When will he be here? This is so exciting! He's been gone so long.
Probably from Bangkorai Garrison. That place has fallen, yes? Many knights were killed.\n\nCrazy Eye is careful not to talk about it in the camp.
Reconnaissance! But keep your voice down. No need to wake the good captain.\n\nAnd know what I learned? There's not a single guard in Northpoint. Not a one! Lleraya ordered them to get out and to keep everyone away.
The briarheart is a powerful gift which makes an almost invincible foe. And we suspect <<1>>'s target would be Evermore, which makes this an issue for your kind to address.\n\nThe Reachmen conquered the city before, and will want it back.
Najan. He finds yet another person to do a husband's work for him. Pathetic.\n\nDon't concern yourself with my wounds. The door to the ruins has been sealed by an Ayleid spell key. You must destroy the focus stones protecting it so we can get inside.
Ah, thank you then for putting my mind at ease. I am in your debt.
Northpoint … it just feels … empty. I sense life in there, but it's faint. Barely perceptible.\n\nWe need to be ready for anything.
That's what I like to hear. You like to fight, don't you? I get that. When I was younger, I felt much the same.\n\nGo burn the bastards' boats then. I'll say a prayer to Saint Pelin for you … for all of us.
Red fur, you say? Yes, running across the rooftops in the sunset. A hunter and protector, long missing from home.\n\nHave you heard tidings of our lost friend? Or do you bring something in its stead?
<This pedestal is meant to hold a scroll.>
They have the grandeya? That is troubling news.\n\nYou've been busy, then. But what news of the traitor? Do you know his identity?
That buffoon? Hah! Of course we can. I am the greatest Mage who has ever lived. Valaste is the greatest living mind in the world. And you have already proven yourself incredibly capable. We will best his trials, and reclaim my island!
A good question, adept. Truly, my greatest regret? I wish I'd spent more time teaching. I always felt my greatest triumphs were the students that followed in my footsteps.
Ah, the dead. They don't rest very quietly these days, do they? Was she some long-dead Ayleid? An unlucky pirate?
Whoever or whatever you may be, I advise you to go away and leave us alone. These people are under my protection, and I will not allow you to harm them.
Because what I'm saying is true! Oh, I've never been good at … speaking my mind. Please, stranger, think of what you've done!
We still need information from the wretch. Fortunately, I know of a simple way to extract it.\n\nAcross the way lies the Mages Guild. Talk to a man named Razin. Ask him for his specialty; it's a potent sedative only he makes.
Yes. We have been challenged with a great task, and need experienced wayfarers like yourself.\n\nSo how about it? Will you join the Fighters Guild?
Indeed. The huge chains that have been falling from the sky? In the Guild we call them "Daedric Anchors." I'm not exactly sure why—but I'm just paid to break them.\n\nI have been told they're falling straight out of Oblivion. Most uncanny.
Hard to say without looking it over. Provided it's not one more copy of "The Lusty Argonian Maid," it might well be worth something.\n\nYou're already on your way to earning membership in the Mages Guild. We offer rewards for books like this.
You're all tyrants. Get away from me.
Very little, unfortunately. It may be a divine piece of the god Rajhin, gifted to his Shadow.\n\nWhy he would squander it upon me is beyond my comprehension.
They headed into Shornhelm. Didn't watch them after that. My eyes stay on the roads, nowadays.\n\nNever know when a bloodfiend will want a snack.
Everyone knows the Ayleids left many secrets behind, and the more we understand about them the more we learn about what remains. Their language is part of this, and as the Ayleids migrated and split, variations of their language emerged.
Osgrikh leaves me no choice. My husband is dead, killed by a hate-filled mongrel, and his honor must be served!\n\nOsgrikh wants to live in the old ways? I'll show him how to die in the old ways.
No one in Grahtwood understands the Khajiit. This one is so tired of it!
I had assumed that this relic she spoke of was a legend. Even when I heard the words of Ostarand, Endarre, and their companions, I thought this was a threat from a time long forgotten. But …comrade, we just saw it. The Vivicus was never destroyed!
They are people from Evermore, Northglen, or other nearby villages.\n\nLike myself, they were drawn to Lorelia. She showed us what was happening and taught us that her plight, the plight of the lake, is our plight too.
We sell "Tamriel is Doomed" survival kits. These are packs of basic survival supplies like dried fruit and bandages. I manage the money, <<1>> is our Prophet of Doom, and we scare enough locals to make a healthy income.
The city's history is … complex. It has changed hands many times. Breton graves are buiilt atop Redguard graves. Orc-hewn stone supports Yokudan-style walls.\n\nEven so, at its heart the city is Redguard. One of our greatest victories occurred here.
This is the site of Derik Hallin's final confrontation with the giant Goblin Mahgzoor Rockhand.\n\nAfter the Ra Gada's long march to Hammerfell, the Yokudans found themselves in a time of relative peace and plenty. Many and many cast down their swords.
It was. Their love of farming and building made them blind to danger. They were set upon by legions of tusked ones, led by a powerful warlord, Mahgzoor. But they had forgotten the way of the sword and stood defenseless.
Here are the phony orders. Just place them into the <<z:1>> in the command tent by the tower, with the <<2>> folded inside them.\n\nIf you can make this work, we'll send those legionnaires back to where they came from.
Directly? No. I doubt that Mephala would take an interest in the affairs of a goat farmer and his wife. But the Webspinner has many servants. A secluded ruin, a foolish, lustful farmer …. Such an opportunity might be hard to pass up.
And let him win? Dumac take it! I'd die a hundred deaths before I admit fault to that flat-headed s'wit. \n\nSo here we sit. Now if you'll pardon me, I have to prepare for a celebratory goat-milking competition.
My sister-wives, <<1>> and <<2>>, will look after me. They know what to do if I … don't recover. \n\nBut all will be well. Be assured of it!
They're mostly homeless from Evermore. Conditions for refugees aren't great there now, and most of the city-folk don't want to take care of these people, even if they were displaced by a war.\n\nThat's where the Dragonstar Caravan Company comes in!
They took my wedding ring, the only thing left of my beloved wife.\n\nWe lived in <<1>> in Glenumbra. She was killed by Bloodthorn cultists, and I've wandered ever since.
Well … yes. I found a talisman in the dark, and a beautiful spirit appeared. She called herself Anexiel. Beautiful Anexiel.\n\nIt's … it's not important. She decieved me. She said she needed a "vessel." Someone with magic in their blood.
He was mortal, once, among the most skilled artisans of his time. Like me.\n\nHe made a deal with the Daedra when he died, and now he builds for them—torments souls for them.
With you? Don't think it'd be much of a fight. Ha ha!
Oh, my grandmother gave me Buttons as a pet when I was just a little boy!\n\nWe were inseparable. When I was little, he carried me on his back, and when I got big, I carried him on my shoulder. Buttons is my favorite friend in all of Tamriel!
I was an artisan. A rival of the Mad Architect's in life.
Well, we're not sure exactly, but when <<1>> went down there, Daedra poured out and killed all our fellow students. It was all we could do to make it to a safe vantage point. But the tower never turned, so here we are.
I … stole designs from him, after Saryne arranged for the Wayrest nobles to deny Dutheil further projects.\n\nGasteau presented those designs to the nobles as renovations for the Royal District, as original works.
I despaired every moment of it.\n\nI was a manager of coin in life. To me, a ledger that never balances is like an itch that never scratches. It nearly drove me mad until you freed me.
Good, but that's the easy part. The hard part's proving yourself.\n\nThis cave seems like a good test. See if you can best whatever's inside. If you survive, come meet me at the Fish Stink in Davon's Watch and we'll make it official.
Then good luck! You'll need it.\n\nWe have one last thing to handle. This'll be your initiation, and your first challenge as an Undaunted. We'll have you bleeding from your eyes and ears in no time. Are you ready?
I am not without resources of my own. When I discovered that Montclair had left the city and heard that the nobles had been taken captive, it wasn't difficult to ferret out the mad Argonian's hiding place.
Too risky. It could be contagious. Plus, I've already tried all the curatives they would suggest. Honestly, I don't even think I can stay here in the camp much longer. I'm putting everyone at risk.
That's the spirit! Then I officially name you one of the Undaunted!\n\nWhat, you were expecting a big ceremony, with trumpets and oaths? No such luck for you. But you do get this ….
Perhaps it is simply our ties to this town. Or perhaps in our last hours, we found the strength to resist Reezal-Jul and his minions.
You'll find the Elden Hollow just beneath us—an ancient graveyard for centaurs and minotaurs. \n\nAnd—listen to this—a Dominion Canonreeve was recently seen there, with a full contingent of Justiciars! None can say why.
Don't know.\n\nNo Daedra's been able to claim my second life.
By the Hist, yes. All the drinks. I want all the drinks.
Baron Wylon Montclair. Not much to say really. Before this, he shared rule with two other noble houses, Dorell and Tamrith. \n\nCountess Tamrith says they were never very close, but she certainly wasn't expecting him to start a war.
It's a secret this one learned from the Moons! Especially Jode, who is chatterbox.\n\nVampire skeevers lurk in shadows to hide from Moons. If you sleep without light on, ziss! Suck your blood right out. But they don't like heat, so south I go!
I'm afraid the "giant Daedric anchors from the sky" issue is more your speciality than my own. I'll let you lead on this one.
Splendid. I'll allow you the honor of informing <<1>>.\n\nWhy not tell him the duly selected High Elf ambassador was working against the very Dominion she pledged to support? I'll sit in my throne and try not to gloat.
Knowing the Dwemer? Probably demented, metal traps.\n\nAnd lethal constructs with purpose only to protect Dwemer treasures. A good time for an Undaunted.
Me? I'd left Evermore and decided to live my life in the woods. And I met a man here, the previous Sentinel. He needed help, and I stayed with him.\n\nWhen he grew too weary, he blessed me with the title.
I have no more prophecies to impart, no more strategies to suggest, no more riddles to ponder. I am just a man. A flawed man. And perhaps that is just as it should be.\n\nFarewell, Vestige. Walk in the light, always.
We all have to eat. But unlike your meals, my sustenance voluntarily allows me to sup. And then gets to walk away and go on with its life.\n\nWhen was the last time a deer or a rabbit approached you and gladly died so that you could have your fill?
Then, in accordance with our contract, I cannot pay them.\n\nYour honesty is refreshing. Thank you.
There are two basins, the Basin of Suffering and the Basin of Loss.\n\nFirst, you must drink the Basin of Suffering, and witness how our mother suffered at the hands of Molag Bal. Then you must show your hatred for Molag Bal by profaning his symbol.
What does that matter? If not for you, I would never have attempted to use such magic to heal Leila.\n\nBesides, Reezal-Jul will be rewarded for his service. I'll see to that personally.
Hmm. Hostages? I knew those bastards were up to something!\n\nDamn. Constable Gavendien just left here with Lady Mondorie. Bailiff Sagabar's still upstairs, though. We should try to get into his room and see what else we can find.
That would make everything perfect! If I had her love, I could enlist and fight with the strength of ten soldiers!\n\nThat's not going to happen, though. It's going to take something special to win her heart, and I haven't a clue as to what that is.
Strange? No. Nothing. Nothing at all. Why would you ask?\n\nOh, well, there's Gaspard. He's a little soft in the head. He's run out of town and refuses to come back. I worry about him. He really should go back home.
No, it's not that simple. You can't hire the Ring of Daggers to fight in some silly war or a military campaign.\n\nWe take contracts for specific tasks which require a few agents. And we maintain our own chain of command.
Oh. Well, in that case. I know! Tell Julien to give her some flowers. She loves flowers.\n\nIf anything will win my sister over, it's a beautiful bouquet of fragrant flowers.
I … I never …. My parents died when I was very young. Even so … your words … they feel right, somehow. I will stay with her. No matter what! Before you go, Arlie wants to speak with you. She's waiting for you just outside.
Only stories. It was once a great Ayleid city. It must have been glorious in its day.\n\nBut when I was growing up, all the tales spoke of a haunted, looming spire. If you must know, the thought of going up there sends shivers down my spine.
Do be careful. I don't need to tell you how dangerous this place is!
The cycle advances, as the golden sun fills each long day.
Northpoint is an important trading center and the heart of my maritime endeavors. Whoever controls the city controls the northern region of Rivenspire. If I were Oblivion-bent on conquering the area, I'd certainly start by taking over the city.
The rules are as follows: riders must cross all checkpoints between the starting line and the finishing line, and riders must not dismount.
He … he did? Oh Nedras! You do love me. Wherever you are, thank you. Thank you for thinking of your poor sister.
Once the fighting starts, there's no time to second guess. You move forward, follow orders—at least the reasonable ones—and kill the enemy. Simple as pie!\n\nAnd when it's all over, you drink up and tell tall tales about what you did.
I saw him throw a coin in the fountain and took it before someone else did. If you want to know what I'm going to do with the coin, I'll probably use it to buy a heel of bread.\n\nSpeaking of coins, I could use more. If you can spare them.
Of course. You only knew his serious side. He had a wild side, too. If this were Ravenwatch Manor, not one of these people would be wearing any clothes!\n\nTruth is, I've never understood mortal parties. They're way too civil for my tastes.
Montclair is here. Of that there can be no doubt. He waits atop the Doomcrag, where he somehow activated ancient defenses to block our path.\n\nWe need to find a way around these defenses and then set up portals to transport our troops up the mountain.
Yes, walker. We seek out new information, capture it in our libraries, and make copies for distribution across Tamriel.\n\nThe Guild cares not about wars, battlefields, or boundaries: just knowledge, and the hunt for new tomes.
Excellent. This one grants you the rank of Student in the Mages Guild. May Magrus bless your path.\n\nEvery book you find, or collection of books completed, will now earn you status within the guild. Good luck, walker.
She's very wise and very knowledgeable about the stars. She came to us only a short while ago, after living in seclusion and studying the old Yokudan astrological traditions.\n\nThe extent of her knowledge is impressive, and she's been very helpful.
He lost the <<1>>? Again? And tried to blame a Hagraven?\n\nI found him last night, drunk as a naked Nord and refusing to listen to a word I said. He ran off, waving the mace and yelling incoherently about mudcrabs and his manly charms.
Terrified. But if I need to battle a newly risen bloodfiend, I'd rather it were an untrained commoner than a highly skilled soldier.\n\nPerhaps after you help <<1>> with the dead members of the guard, he can perform a few rituals for the refugees.
I've been sent to battlefields before. Most recently at Hinault Farm. But this is the first time I had to sanctify bodies potentially corrupted by a blood-curse.
Excellent!  I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will earn you reputation in the guild. Walk with Julianos, my friend.
Well, I never thought of it that way, but yes, I suppose we are! Our quarry is knowledge, you see. The Guild doesn't care about wars, battlefields, or boundaries—just wisdom. Any books you acquire will improve your reputation with the Mages Guild.
They seem to be attacking everyone. Clearly these soldiers died in battle. In death, their hatred and battle-lust lives on eternally. The perfect weapon, in the right hands.
Oh come now, surely you've heard of us. We're a scholarly organization. Guild members seek out books, tomes, and ancient scrolls in their travels. Often in dangerous places. Sounds exciting, yes?
Aye! The Guild is my one true love. You should join up. Our new guildmaster is a good Argonian woman, Sees-All-Colors. She has us working to a singular purpose: hunting down the Daedra and their damned Anchors. Hard fights.
Enormous chains drop from the sky! A portal to Oblivion opens, and Daedra boil out to lay waste to the countryside. I don't know who started calling them Daedric Anchors, but Mauloch knows it fits!
I don't know what to make of this. The Bosmer aren't like us. They have an unsual diet, and are not particularly serious.\n\nMost of them don't seem to care for us. Best be on our guard in case they try something rash.
As a matter of fact, I do. The terrain isn't level, which didn't matter when it was covered in trees.\n\nWe needed to complete the work quickly. Rather than wait for someone with the capacity to reform the land, we built it as you see now.
The plague! It's in the air and the water. It's even on your skin! Crawling, burrowing, getting deep inside.\n\nDon't you understand? It's not safe! And they're watching us. Always watching ….
That's not important. Get my sister out of here and stop the Maulborn.\n\nDestroy the so-called curative and put an end to that mad woman, Nostrum Breva.
The obvious answer is probably the right one. Pelidil. That toad fulfilled Naemon's every wish. Why should that change just because the Prince is dead?\n\nRaz knew the Veiled Heritance was a disease not so easily excised. Hmph.
Thanks for the insight, but I was already leaning in that direction. Between the smell and information that Aerona brought back with her, it seemed kind of obvious.\n\nBut with your confirmation, I can narrow my course of research considerably.
And I feel better! No silly plague was going to lay me low.\n\nAnd I suppose that Nilyne's potions helped, as well.
What? Why didn't you say so? I owe Dethisam more than I could ever repay. Plus, he's always been a good customer.\n\nPlease, take this. It's all I have left.
I am one of the Hollow. I do not know where we came from, but we are assigned to protect different parts of Valenwood.\n\nI am assigned to protect Greenheart, to ensure none can reach the throne of the Wilderking without his invitation.
As you say! I hearby grant you membership in the Mages Guild, with all the responsibilities and privileges thereof. Every book you find, and every book collection you complete, will now earn you reputation in the guild. Good luck!
Unfortunately, no. This Veiled Heritance seems set upon attacking the heart and soul of our people, and that is the Valenwood.\n\nI sense that even darker threats are emerging elsewhere. I hope you or someone like you is there to stand in our defense.
Guildmaster Jofnir passed away recently, and very suddenly. We always thought he'd die with a blade in his hand. But he passed in his sleep, called to Sovngarde by his ancestors. \n\nWe all miss him, but Colors has proven to be a very able leader.
<The crumpled note threatens to bring Belronen's heretical trade in Daedric relics to the attention of the Tribunal if Telvanni does not pay.>\n\n<The letter is signed "V" but bears no other distinguishing marks.>
Guildmaster Jofnir passed away very suddenly. Always thought he'd die with a blade in his hand. Instead he passed in his sleep, called to Sovngarde by his ancestors. \n\nWe all miss him, but in short order Colors has proven to be a very able leader.
No. It's not. No matter which I choose, I will always wonder what would've happened had I taken the other path.\n\nI know which way is easy, and which is hard. What would you choose? I will do as you would, since the Wilderking sent you to us.
A common enough name for old cultist ruins in the Ashlands. This particular nest is almost due south out of the city, in the hills around the river. Swarming with Goblins, just rancid with the beasts. \n\nA fantastic resource.
Ha! Deal. Bottoms up.\n\nAnd speaking of bottoms, my quartermaster prefers a crisp fold in his breeches.
Take as much time as you need. It'll give my stomach time to return from wherever it traveled.\n\nSomewhere with a hurricane, no doubt ….
At least my father still lives. But he placed such value on family, and now I'm all he has left.\n\nNo one ever attacked us before. I don't understand what's changed. It's not us. Please, let me be for now. I need time to recover.
Hmm! That is a good answer. Not the one I seek, but it works for the riddle.\n\nVery clever! I will re-write my riddle for Telenger, and he will pay for it, which means I get my gold after all. Everyone wins!
Tradition holds that the Mage, the Warrior, and the Thief are the Guardian star signs. But the magical events in the foothills of Craglorn—including an ever-growing army of atronachs—suggest that the Mage has fallen under the Serpent's control.
Peace, yes. I don't know if I'll ever be at peace with what happened here. Like everyone, I was so enamored of Abelazar, I never imagined what was to come.
Yes. They attack Craglorn against their will.\n\nListen. The Serpent's nature is chaos. He wants to undermine the very order of reality. He will not stop with Craglorn.
My power alone is not enough. You must free the other Guardians. I will help you as much as I dare, but the Serpent is looking for me. If he ensnares me as he has the others, all is lost.
I can't promise that my answers will satisfy. Craglorn has always been a harsh place and desolate. Much of Craglorn's history has long since passed into myth.
During my time on Tamriel, I developed a very useful spell. A memory charm of sorts. Rather than wasting my time puttering around in libraries trying to find a book, the spell allows me to recall it instantly.\n\nIf you'll allow me?
It is. And from everything I've heard, your Queen Ayrenn is a good woman. But the Dominion believes that the Elves will rule Tamriel. That mer, not men, will take the Ruby Throne. More Worm Cult lies.
"Rogutter: Keep this runestone out of the mine! If you bring it near the Unspeakable Sigil, the portal closes. Then we're cut off from the relics. That means we don't get paid!"\n\n"If you don't understand, I'll start breaking fingers until you do."
This is more than I'd dared to hope! You are S'rendarr himself, walker. S'rendarr himself!
So says the root to the toad that licks it in the dry season. Keep your moisture. May it serve you well.
Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as a comrade in arms of the Fighters Guild!\n\nGet out there, and take the fight to the Daedra!
You should join up! Our new guildmaster is an Argonian woman, Sees-All-Colors. She has us working to a singular purpose—hunting down the Daedra and their damned Anchors.

There might be. The people who led us down here drug poor Nahlia through the doors at the far end of the room. Watched them slam shut behind them.\n\nI have no idea how to open the doors, but the scroll I found above me might give us a clue of sorts.
All reagents have hidden properties. When they are combined with other ingredients that bestow the same benefits, the potency is compounded. This reaction determines the nature of the potion. It's just a matter of experimentation, you see?
Well not just any water will do. You'll find that some pools of water contain special qualities that make them ideal for potion-making. The grade of the water determines the potency of the product.
Sure. While shaping the wood, we can choose a special trait to focus on. It takes research to discover these techniques, but it's well worth the effort. Increasing the weight or tuning the angle can draw out different advantages in the final product.
Glyphs are assembled by combining three different runes. \n\nPotency runes determine the glyph's strength. Aspect affects the glyph's quality. Finally, the Essence rune decides the glyph's effect.\n\nIt's a delicate art best learned by doing. Good luck.
Certainly! Woodworkers shape wood into all manner of useful tools, but bows, staves, and shields are our specialty. This work requires fine lumber and a sturdy work table.\n\nWe also seek out style books and rare ingredients for more advanced work.
Of course! Enchanting is the art of empowerment. We gather runes found throughout the world and use our special instruments to assemble them into glyphs. These glyphs can be used to magically enhance worn or wielded items.

We put hammer to anvil to forge armor and weapons. This requires a lot of metal. We scour hills and caves looking for rare ores to work. \n\nRaw materials will only take you so far. You need style books and special ingredients for more advanced work.
Not exactly. Runes can be extracted from glyphs you find while adventuring. It's a delicate process, so you'll have to return to one of our work stations to proceed. Note that the glyph will be destroyed in the process. Unfortunate, but necessary.

Don't forget drink! \n\nHearty meals will fill your belly, increasing your general well-being—both body and soul. Strong drink can stimulate the humors, allowing you to recover more quickly.\n\nIf you're lucky, you might find a recipe that does both!

We tan, weave, stitch—you name it. People in search of medium and light armor come to us. This requires fibers, leather, and a work table like those found in town.\n\nWe also seek out style books and special ingredients for more advanced work.

Once you've copied the recipe down and acquired the necessary ingredients, that's when the real fun begins. Cooking pots and rotisseries can be found all over. You need only find one, select a recipe, and then indulge in the simple joy of cooking!
Of course! We provisioners practice the arts of cooking and brewing. \n\nGood food requires the best ingredients. We gather fresh meat and produce from crates, barrels, and the like. If we're lucky, we'll also find recipes in chests, trunks, and desks.

Well, the piece can be improved even more through the use of tannins. These elements can enhance the value and quality of your work. Just be cautious. You risk ruining the piece if you're not careful. Improving on perfection is no mean feat!

You bet. A true blacksmith can read the metal to determine its potential. During the forging process we can choose a trait that best fits the item—provided we've done our research. Additional sharpening, extra weight … these are just examples.
Tastes like sandals boiled in mint perfume.\n\nBut if it knits my ribs, I'll drink the whole bottle.
Glow juice? By the gods, it just might! Soon as I can stand on my own, I'll head inland.
There's only one explanation I can think of, and it's not exactly reassuring.\n\nIf someone found the entrance before us and activated it, the residual energy would continue to emanate for a while after. If we go inside, we won't be alone.
Yes, Hermaeus Mora—the Prince of Fate, the Lord of Secrets. We are his watchful children. \n\nWhen we heard that this ancient city had been discovered, we raced here to plumb its depths. Fortunately, this pack of would-be scholars arrived first.
Belkarth? Hmm. So I have chosen to hide near Belkarth. In a place made for another.\n\nDo you have any news of the Lost One? I know that she is moving against us, but I do not perceive her actions directly.
This is a critical waypoint on the road to Cyrodiil. Our supply train is vulnerable on the High Road through Bangkorai, so we serve as a bulwark against Ebonheart skirmishers. \n\nThe Reach is full of Nord militants. Luckily, they rarely come in force.
My orders are to protect the supply train. Nothing more. \n\nNow, if star monsters attack our convoys, well … I guess we'll see what happens.
Thanks. We need it.
Ah, but you don't know this one's other problem.
There is a door to the Arboretum District over there, but it only goes out. It is locked on the other side. \n\nIf you haven't spoken with General Nedras or Sergeant Shaghila, this one suggests you do before you leave.
What can we do? We cower here, hoping the Dominion can defeat this evil and at least give us our city back.\n\nI'm beginning to suspect there's little chance of even that.
Thank you. With the Seeker's Sight restored, we can locate our other aspects before the Serpent takes control of them.\n\nWhen you finish mending the Seeker's Sight, meet us at the winery outside of Belkarth. We will wait for you there.
Hold still but a moment and we will show you. Witness the treachery of the Serpent.
Tarish-Zi took an interest in me after his soldiers returned with the tale. He sent the messenger to ask me to join his guard. \n\nBut the messenger confided the mad king's plans to invade my homeland. A course his own people opposed, but in secret.
Aye. Many were sent forth before we killed Tarish-Zi, and it seems clear that they will roam until put down. \n\nWithout their leader, we can take comfort knowing they won't be rallied into a proper army. I hope their souls find rest in the end.
You must be new to the area. Before the trade roads were cut off, the town of Dragonstar held a grand melee every year.\n\nFighters came from all over to participate. But I've never heard of a victory like this.
We hold here. If we're lucky, they'll quiet down long enough for us to gather our dead. If we're very lucky, they'll pack their things and head back to their warcamp.
I came to Hammerfell with a few other Orcs. One of the chiefs was going to pick a new wife. I wasn't chosen, but I was allowed to attend the feast that night. \n\nThat's when the Iron Orcs attacked.
I lost a small potion bottle, my work clothes, some finely-ground mineral dust, and, well, a type of screw-driven tool I'd rather not elaborate on out in the open.
Excellent! Let us leave my beautiful home, and prepare to walk from the plaza before my front door.
We do not face these troubled times alone. Many shall rise up to fight this tide of darkness.\n\nWherever you go, you will encounter others who share your courage and valor. Help them if you can, and enlist their aid if you have need of it.
<It appears the Sea Viper died while ransacking the building. Some sort of magical energy killed her instantly.>\n\n<Upon further examination, a crumpled piece of paper is clutched tightly in her hand.>
My husband and I met as adventurers. We built this place as a school to teach practical sorcery and use-of-arms as survival skills.\n\nThe world can be a dangerous place, and we wanted to give our students the means to tame it. Like we did.
My husband made a Daedric pact. One night, the Daedra, under contract with my husband, invaded the walls of this academy. \n\nThey slayed us, tortured our souls for years before we were freed. But my husband has returned.
Some of my colleagues believe that the Nedes created the Mundus Stones and set them in place across Tamriel. They were able to imbue their stonework with Aetherial energy—using techniques we can't replicate today.\n\nI believe nirncrux was the key.
Anytime you need. Are you ready to go?
Why does it care where the meat is now? All that matters is where the meat will be.\n\nFresh meat will set aged meat on fire. This is how it will strike.
My son? But ….\n\nYes. Yes, I see now. She could only be free when her children were given to the Void.
These caverns make up the Sanctum Ophidia. And my brothers and sisters will give their lives before they let you near its secrets.\n\nThough, it's likely you'll die first. Just ask these fools.
Let's say we have a love/hate relationship. We love the gold they earn us, they hate our constant interference. But we have to protect our investment, don't we?\n\nDragonstar started as a mining town. That gives the miners an unhealthy outlook on life.
Besides the scorpions, the Court alchemists utilize the traits of numerous predators. There are two other primary contributors—a specially bred wamasu … and one other I hesitate to mention.\n\nWe'll talk more after we deal with the scorpions.
I studied ancient texts back in Sentinel. They suggested that passages lead deep underground to ritual chambers where necromancy and other dark magics were practiced. If there is a source to the darkness, it is certain to be down there.
There you go again. Asking another question. As for the answer ….\n\nNo, that would be telling.
Well, I'm not an expert or anything. But I've been to all the feasts and get-togethers. One of the prerequisites of being Regent Cassipia's seneschal and bosom companion.\n\nI watch. I listen. And I take excellent notes!
That's what we call ourselves. The Five Claws. We were simple Baandari, but we turned out to be far better warriors than we were traders.\n\nExcept for Elf-Biter. Her juggling is sleek!
This one doesn't pay attention to the other warriors. They are boring and refuse to run when I want to chase them. \n\nMany of them also smell bad.
Perhaps. It was not entirely his fault. He was fast asleep when Khasabi stabbed him.\n\nImportant lesson: Never pick a fight with a Khajiit if they know where you sleep. Now he drinks mead through a piece of straw. Sad for him, but amusing, yes?
We've heard rumors, but I refuse to give credence to most of the wild stories I've listened to.\n\nMy guess? Common bandits. Or fat Orc-wives dressed as Daedra, for all I know. I don't really care. It won't be anything we can't handle.
Imperial soldiers are always prepared.  Whatever's inside the Arena, it won't be able to stand against the strength of Akatosh.
What do I think of these so-called "gladiators?" Hmph. Drunken paupers and traitors to the Empire! The lot of them aren't worth half a wounded Legionnaire. \n\nThere's not a shred of discipline beyond our camp. Disgraceful.
Well, as I said, Holstagg gets easily excited. When he killed that guar with his bare hands, I knew he had a talent that could earn us more than my crops ever would.\n\nHolstagg doesn't talk much, but there's never a dull moment when we're together.
I … I don't know. I have no doubt he is capable of doing as he claims. He slaughtered us like we were horkers.\n\nBut you may have a point. Perhaps something is keeping him from emerging.
The better question might be who isn't competing. We have a fascinating mix of proven warriors and brutal killers. They can fight and that's all that matters.\n\nAnd I have it on good authority that there are some surprises in store. So exciting!
Understood. I—thank you for freeing me. I'll take it from here.
Certainly. Please specify.
Well, before you and my husband got here, the plan was easy—survive.\n\nYou can handle yourself, but Fingaenion won't last. He's frailer than these Undaunted, and you've seen how they fare. I'm going to get the lot of you out.
I have a reputation for not being overly … emotional. But the story of Alanwe and Nerien'eth stirs even my stony heart. It is good you could bring that tragic tale to an end.
Intense? Perhaps. But I made the world a better place. Too bad the army doesn't see it that way. I've got real leadership potential—just ask around. \n\nExcept Deleren. Don't ask him. He's a miserable pig. Say … do you have a bucket I can borrow?
Yeah sure, the Iron Orcs will catch on—eventually. But we'll be long gone by then. I'm sure those fine people in Dragonstar will be able to handle it. And if not … well, we'll have a lot of work to do. There's lots of goods behind those walls.
You can learn how to craft with another race's style material by studying racial motif books. They're quite rare, mostly held by collectors, so watch for them in your travels.
That's right! You're the one with the unique finish to your pieces, aren't you?\n\nI can certify you right away, if you'd like—or I can run you through the basics, if you need to refresh your memory.
Absolutely, for such is the essence of enchanting. \n\nRunes of potency, essence, and aspect are the fundamental components of glyphs. Collect one of each variety before you return.
A bird curse? Very unusual. Very rare. \n\nBut I have read about hagravens inflicting such curses on innocent people. Hagravens can be cruel and uncaring creatures. What a shame about the poor people that were transformed.
If I seem young for my responsibility, Snordan is to blame. He swindled my father out of his property and his livestock, leaving him to die in shame.\n\nSnordan is responsible for his death, as surely as if he'd run a blade through his heart.
In the longhouse, tending to his wounds and raging about the troubles that have befallen us. \n\nBy Malacath's crooked tusk, chiefs and their howling! He's useless when he's like this.
You can find my son at the camp outside Frostbreak Fortress. It's an old Breton fort southwest of Orsinium. We've been laying siege to the place for weeks, but Ice-Heart and his rats have burrowed deep.\n\nGo and help my son exterminate the vermin.
A merchant friend keeps me informed of Shatul. When she brought word of my father's injuries, I had to return and contend for chief.\n\nShatul must survive.
The tales of this place speak of many failed attempts by Orc explorers to crack its secrets. Instead of claiming riches, the ruins claimed them. But who or what has mangled them so?
Oh? Then the engineer can draw up new schematics, yes? Zazabukhi will be pleased. Of course, that is only if he comes makes it to Orsinium.\n\nHe is on his way, though, yes?
Mark me, this city can be rebuilt. My builders have fled, but I will call them back, when the time is right. And together we can not just restore the city, but make it shine as never before!
You're supposed to help me!
Yes, yes! Your ship is ready, and a fine one it is. Very few rats, plenty of fruit.\n\nLet me know when you're ready to set sail.
A sea of them. \n\nThey've built portals all over the city and more pour in by the hour. Breaking their anchors may weaken their hold on the city, but only for a time. They always come back. Sithis rejoices at such chaos. Nesh-Tan prefers victory.
Perhaps you have encountered Dark Anchors in other parts of Tamriel? Even so, these are very different. \n\nThey cannot be broken here. The only way is to destroy the pinions attaching the anchor on the other end, in Coldharbour.
Well, if you must know, I was curator at Arcane University many years ago. I have no skills in magic, however, and eventually they replaced me with someone who did.\n\nI thought I deserved to keep a few souvenirs. This crystal was among them.
Bless you, then. If the Divines haven't abandoned us, I pray they watch over you and guide your steps.\n\nIf those Daedra return and resume that ritual I pray I can find you again … or someone like you.
We can't be sure. I've not seen any of my fellow generals since the first attack. I prefer to think that they were slain in battle. I can't bear the idea that one of my old friends serves Molag  Bal.
Yeah. About a dozen of us. \n\nWe were part of a deep-wood auxiliary unit. When the anchors fell and the legion fractured we went to ground. Unfortunately, most of us were discovered and killed. There are only so many trees to perch in, you know?
You're one of the pretenders I've heard so much about, passing the false title of ruler among yourselves like some lewd disease.\n\nYou sicken me. I will end the struggle in Cyrodiil today. As if one could force their way onto the Ruby Throne.
My family is descended from the Na-Totambu; we are Crowns, so I never agreed with Fahara'jad's decision to join the Covenant in the first place. \n\nI try to be open-minded, but I must tell you—your General Aklash is a very unpleasant woman.
When I tried to talk about the importance of helping the people here, rather than simply trying to take control, she mocked me.\n\nWhen I persisted, she resorted to poking fun about the burns on my face. I don't think that's funny.
Oh, I can't reveal all of our secrets just yet. Suffice it to say that the upcoming attempt to clean up our fair cities will provide limitless opportunities for my associates and I.\n\nBut I'm willing to cut you in on the action. We'll talk again soon.
Their camps are easy to find. But if you are fortunate, you may chance to learn the location of one of their dens.\n\nFilled with stolen goods and rife with devious traps, there is little more satisfying than cleansing one of these hidden rats' nests.
I knew you'd see things right. Now, I'm supposed to make you swear that you'll renounce … villainy? Or is it lawlessness? Either way. Do you do that?
You noticed!\n\nMy father was an influential diplomat before the Banner War began. In truth, I've spent more time here in the Imperial City than I have in Skyrim. When the rebellion began, my father chose to stay here. More opportunities he said.
Molag Bal offers power. Molag Bal is power. This inane puppet play that you provincials are so fond of … trading keeps like some stupid Baandari shell game—it's pointless. \n\nEverything. All of this—it's a sham. Can't you see?
As always in politics, there were complicating factors, and as wily as I may like to think myself, Abnur Tharn and Mannimarco always maintained the upper hand.\n\nPerhaps you should try for a seat on the Elder Council and then you can do better.
The king was skeptical at first, but he and a few clan chiefs eventually embraced the will of Trinimac.\n\nMost of the other chiefs remain opposed to such drastic change, however. They hold onto the old superstitions and refuse to hear the truth.
A plan? Narsis Dren always has a plan. Haven't you read my books?\n\nOf course, it's a work in progress. I'm sure it involves locating the main burial chamber and finding a switch or lever. In my experience, it's always a switch or lever. Now, onward!
Of course! Any friend of Rigurt's is a friend of mine!\n\nThe ambassador has been very curious about seductive Orcish delicacies, which is the best way to win an Orc's heart. But I must warn you. Some of these items will be difficult to acquire.
Orcs love ale! Any kind of ale! But the ale that's most likely to put an Orc maiden in a romantic mood is made by a reclusive brewer in southern Wrothgar. I love the stuff!\n\nPerhaps Lum gro-Buzbee will trade his ale for the rare mead Rigurt gave you.
The Armlet of Torug should remain in his shrine. Make sure every Orc climbs Sorrow to see it, to understand what our ancestors were capable of achieving. In this way the relic will become a symbol to bind our people together. Surely you can see that?
Orcs aren't worth their weight in horker stew without a romantic urge and a healthy taste for good ale. But yes, my special brew has been known to accentuate the urge. Especially in women.\n\nThat's why I stay out here and keep my batches small.
As long as the Winterborn remain a threat, the chiefs will follow King Kurog. But after that? I think a lot depends on the outcome of this campaign.\n\nBut no matter what happens, my soldiers and my clan remain dedicated to the king and his vision.
Increased patrols around the perimeter, soldiers assigned to guard the inside of the temple. The priests will not have to live in fear of another attack, not so long as my son is king.\n\nI assume you know who claimed responsibility for this?
I think you're right. Making these puzzles seemed to give her some small amount of hope in a difficult situation.\n\nI still need to find my cat. I'll scout ahead and see if my mother left anything else for me.
Someone needs to examine the stolen supplies and get them ready for transport. Might as well be me.\n\nMeet me back at the keep when you're done. I want you there when I tell the chiefs what we accomplished today.
Then the corpse to which you've bound my soul will rot for decades. I will have no company but mindless, imperfect beasts. I will go mad, and years later I will expire.\n\nPlease, end my suffering. You owe me that much. Please.
Orsinium, most likely. If all I recovered is a tale of woe and terror, I might as well use it to earn some drinks. Walk where the echateres walk, my friend.\n\nUnless they have the flux. Then walk two paces to the right. Trust me on this.
The choice was yours, though Malacath always demands a sacrifice, a display of loyalty and commitment.\n\nBut rest assured. The Keeper knew her role and she relished the taste of it.
The Agra Crun is all around, hidden in plain sight. In Orsinium, for example, waits one of the most powerful of our order.\n\nTake the scroll to Kroma, but protect it until you reach her. The Trinimac cult wants the truth destroyed at any cost.
I can tell you how long it takes steel to melt. You want old stories? Go ask a poet.
You think you can accomplish what me and my strongest warriors have been unable to do?\n\nVery well, outsider. Restore order in the Graystone Quarry and I will go and listen to Kurog's fancy words.
I'll gather up Raynor's tinkering tools and follow you. Once I catch up, we can help Raynor disable that rolling monstrosity!\n\nBut don't wait for me! Raynor needs you! Now get going!
The door to this tomb commemorates <<1>>'s final duel. His image is identical to engravings from that period—there's no question it's him.\n\nHe respected every opponent he challenged. That's reflected in the depiction of <<2>>, his final opponent.
There are catacombs nearby with similar stonework to this tomb, but they're crawling with Winterborn. Try there—look for a monument stone of some kind.
Me? Help Kurog?\n\nWhere was our so-called king when my clan was at the mercy of the Vosh Rakh? Where was he when my people were dying or being forced to join this cult against their will?
To the vanquished, this isn't the statue of a hero. It's a tribute to a tyrant.\n\nMany see me in the same way. A tyrant, forcing my ideas upon the people. They say I'm wrong, that I'll destroy the Orsimer. They seek to turn everyone against me.
Giving away your own coin so <<1>> can gain satisfaction? This isn't your affair. Why would you do this?
I will find other members of our order, if they still survive. If not, I will recruit new members. Either way, we will rebuild. The banner will serve to rally us.\n\nI won't let Magnar and his mangy beasts win the day. I simply won't allow it.
No, no. If this one simply blurts out the answer, then you will have learned nothing. Better to teach you to hunt than hand you a sandwich, yes?\n\nThe beginning of each thought. Look at the first word of every sentence, then all will become clear.
The Vosh Rakh want to make a statement. Something big. Bazrag thinks it involves the moot, where all the chiefs will be gathered.\n\nWe need more information. Someone needs to enter the old Trinimac temple to the west and learn more about their plans.
It's the Drome of Toxic Shock! The Baron who Moves like Wind in the Reeds really poured his heart into this one. Curious that such a gentle soul should create an arena as lethal as this one.\n\nTriumph here, challenger, and restore my baron to me.
Does that surprise you? My people have lost their way under the stifling traditions of Malacath. I seek to unite us on a new path, a path devoted to the true god, Trinimac!\n\nA new age begins, an age that will see the Orsimer attain power and glory.
We all have our purpose. The people will rally against Solgra and demand justice. Our agents are already hunting her down. Before the moot ends, we will have her.\n\nBut again, that is not your concern. You have another mission to perform.
Well, yes. Of course something did. Go and speak to the king, outsider. I prefer that you hear the news from his mouth instead of from mine.
I used to think he was a good ruler. Strong, honorable. But he's a menace. He's let himself become more important than his ideas.\n\nSo go and do what you do so well. I'll wait right here. Recovering. I want to be ready for the next adventure.
You have my thanks, friend, and that of the Orcish people. Now, you can look upon those great stone walls with pride, knowing that you helped build them. You are Orsinium!
Right. The brand binds the skeleton to a single, very specific task. Once you've set the mark, the skeleton should recite the details of the task aloud. That will tell us everything we need to know about what they're looking for.
I have my orders.\n\nDon't you know that High Priestess Solgra is a criminal, an enemy of the Orsimer? She's the leader of the Vosh Rakh! You should thank me for what I've done.
The hagravens would know the moment I held it in my hands. Better if I never even saw the thing.
Time starts now.\n\nDo try and not fail this time. It makes you look worse than you already are.
That damned cat! I'm not sure who causes us more trouble, my brother or his furry pet!\n\nDon't worry. We'll wait for him. He may be different and a bit odd, but he is my brother and I do love him.
Yes. And no.\n\nI found it tucked between some of Marukh's polemics, just before the invasion. I've spent the better part of thirty years in those archives, friend. To find this scroll just days before the anchors fell … it can't be coincidence.
I don't see that it's any of your business. But this is obviously going to become an issue ….\n\nThis place makes me uncomfortable. The Temple District, I mean. Well, I should clarify—the people here make me uncomfortable. Religious people.
How sad that old superstitions blind you to Trinimac's truth. But even if you won't believe in him, Trinimac believes in you.
A Vengeful March across Wrothgar, from here to the statue of Malacath. According to the hagravens, its bearer will carry Malacath's blessing.\n\nWith a champion of the Winterborn crowned by Malacath, we could then march on Orsinium.
My tribe reveres Malacath, but we are nothing to him. This fighting with Wrothgar's Orcs serves to amuse a Daedric Prince—nothing more.
Through some of the best soldiering I've ever seen. These soldiers are lions. Stubborn as High Rock mules. We've also been lucky. Very lucky.\n\nI figure we've made things so damned difficult that the Daedra have found better things to do.
I suppose it's time for that. It's all due to a scroll. Old magic.\n\nJust before Molag Bal's assault on Imperial City, a group of priests unearthed an ancient scroll they claimed dated back to the time of St. Alessia. Never asked where they found it.
Not completely. I'm sure there are still pockets of deluded cultists hiding throughout the countryside. We'll deal with them eventually.\n\nRight now, I need to figure out what to do with the clans that lost their chiefs. And with this damnable city.
Oh, right. I'm sorry.\n\nYour guess is as good as mine. When they came to the library looking for it, it was all I could do to garble the text with a distortion spell before they got through the door. But now with the ciphers, I can undo the spell.
The Barons Who Move Like This! My Daedric Conflict Resolution Coaches, each specializing in a different kind of mayhem! \n\nThey threw themselves so far into the task of creating my arenas, that each was … absorbed … into the final creation.
The corruption.\n\nMembers of Legion Zero are forced to drink a foul potion. It's an initiation of sorts. It makes them aggressive. Erratic. He probably doesn't want to endanger me … my mission, I mean. He might be less concerned about hurting you.
What else would you call it? We're so close to Exile's Barrow that we woke up the dead!\n\nAnd let me tell you, there's nothing worse than waking up dead Nords. Nords get even more irritable after they're dead!
Do you really expect me to explain—? Oh, you're joking. You're joking, right?
If you want to become bird food, I'm not going to stop you. And after losing more soldiers to the harpies, I'm ready to accept any help I can get.\n\nBesides, anything is better than what the little Wood Elf was able to accomplish.
I call it "tundra hay," because the echatere always nibble on it. You'll want to find a patch near the open water. Those are more naturally salty.\n\nWith enough <<z:1>>, you weave a pocket for the harpy viscera. The flavor bakes right in.
Oh! Er, I meant no offense! I just mean that, well, Orcs can be difficult to understand. Hard to tell if you're in a foul mood or not.\n\nSkordo seems a fine sort, if a little surly. He calls me all kinds of insulting names. All in good fun, I'm sure.
For the time period, I'd say so! And even now, as Wrothgar struggles with the clashing cultures of city and stronghold, examples such as this go a long way toward making the king's point.\n\nBesides, a little scandal always attracts visitors!
I go where the need takes me. The Orcs needed an expert on the Reach, so here I am.\n\nAfter Camlorn, I spent some time with the Wyrd Sisters. They taught me more about the Wyrd and the Reach than I ever thought possible. It was a fascinating time!
Hmm. A gold pendant, did you say? Let me think ….\n\nYes. This one heard Youss ask you to look for a pendant. But if he has a betrothed back home, someone should really tell the lovely Azeeda. She seemed very attracted to him during the voyage.
I'm completely confident of my abilities. That's just my nature.\n\nAt its core, Reach magic is all the same. They just employ different vessels for their perversions. Once you know how to kill one vile and twisted plant, you can kill them all.
What haven't the Orcs done? They claim land that rightfully belongs to the Reach. They attack and kill my people. They eat food that should be eaten by Winterborn. They are animals!\n\nAnd not even the help of outsiders will save them from my wrath.
They're simple spring traps—iron clamp with nasty teeth. Nothing special. There's no need to be clever with this lot. The brutes reach down to pick up a hunk of delicious meat, and wham! Off come the fingers. Thumb too, if I'm lucky.
Listen, it wasn't my fault.\n\nAlinon sent me to get him some moss that grows on the walls down here. When I got back, the alchemist was gone.
Lady Sovelle? She's a remarkable woman. High King Emeric thinks the world of her. Always sends her on the most important diplomatic missions of the realm.\n\nThe last I saw her, she was helping survivors get off one of the sinking ships.
Well, it hasn't been a picnic in the park, but I'm happy with our progress.\n\nSkordo was instrumental in forcing the Nord ambassador to back down and allow me to participate in the proceedings, even though we were terribly late to the affair.
And yet you find yourself in a sewer. Forgive me for dismissing your opinion into the muck from which it formed.\n\nGood day.
Yes, indeed! As you may recall, I specialize in the sale of all things ovoid. I've heard rumors about some bizarre eggs tucked away in Coldperch Cavern, and I'm keen to get my hands on some.
Only those of the Reach know the ways of the Reach.\n\nBut … when <<1>> left the village, the Winterborn rode at her back. All the villagers were so full of arrows they resembled pine cones. And Evandene's corpse decorated the altar to Malacath.
<You burn the tome to ash.>
What? Of course not! Chief Bazrag would never put innocents in danger, not even if Kurog insulted his honor.\n\nTell me who these imposters were so that I can deal with them in accordance with the curse and the code!
Very well. But my chief is innocent. We must clear his name. I'll contact my sources and investigate from my end if you promise to do the same.\n\nNow where is Chief Bazrag?
Well, maybe, if there's actually a hidden message and it's not just some weird poem.\n\nI have a friend, sort of. Name's Kalina. She just arrived in the Mages Guild and she's the smartest person I know. She could help you. Probably.
Well, with all the runners we spotted, we know we're in the right place. We just need a way to get inside without being noticed.\n\nYou know, we might be able to do something with those higher-ranking cultists in the fancy masks.
I don't think that's entirely appropriate. We don't know each other and I am really very busy.\n\nExcuse me.
Oh.\n\nWell, he'd be alive if he hadn't tried to frame me. The whole thing was his idea.
Hmm. Exquisite example of late First Era Orsimer craftsmanship … possibly dating back to Old Orsinium? The envy of any collection.\n\nIf one were into collecting First Era Orsimer trinkets. Which I am not.
That's something, but not enough to provide the edge we were hoping for.\n\nWe'll just have to be careful. Anyone could be working with the Vosh Rakh. I don't know about you, but all this intrigue is starting to make my head hurt.
Some of Kurog's ideas have merit, I'll give him that. \n\nBut the cost he's willing to bear to see his plans through to fruition? Murder. A city built on fresh graves. And the madness doesn't end there.
I understand. Not everyone cares to keep the old traditions alive, not with all this talk of Trinimac and the future.\n\nWell, good luck to you, any way.
Indeed I do. I make the best of it though. Where there are eggs, there are also women.\n\nI've got to say though, these Orc ladies are a bit chilly. Must be the diet. Nothing but meat and turnips would turn even Dibella sour, am I right?
I oversee all the workers, develop the plans for repairs and new construction, order supplies … it keeps me busy! Luckily, we had a good foundation to build upon. The Orcs that came before us certainly made things to last!
You? But … no Orc woman has ever led Shatul. Or any Orc clan.\n\nThere's no possibility. Such a radical idea would drive the clan apart.
No, walker. The pain is still too near. This one needs more drink …. Yes, another drink and I will tell you my tale.
I'm going to miss you, my friend. I truly believe that Trinimac sent you to us when we needed you most.\n\nI wish you well. If you ever have need of me, I'll do my best to be at your side.
Yeah, I'm fit as a sodding fiddle. Can't you tell? \n\nBah. 'Course I'm not all right. That damn mountain beat the piss out of us.
Not exactly. It's harder than steel—a powerful distraction in a fight, for those who think it a weakness.
As well you should. I am certain you have questions, but first we must determine if you are worthy of joining the Dark Brotherhood.\n\nYou take lives easily and without hesitation. We know that you can kill. Now show us that you can also obey.
A series of smuggler tunnels runs beneath the Withered Rose and leads directly to the estate's courtyard. That's the route I would take.\n\nAnd don't forget to bring lockpicks. Jarol is a cautious man. He never leaves a door unlocked behind him.
Ah, the look on your face is unmistakable! It says, if I may speak for your most resplendent face, "Peace, my exceptionally sleek mercantile friend. Take a series of deep, relaxing breaths so you may reveal the matter at hand."\n\nIn, out. In, out.
Sure you can. So could Durisa. She still ended up face down in an Anvil alley with her throat slit from ear to ear. Whoever murdered her has some impressive skills, I'll give them that.\n\nStay sharp, New-blade. We're not alone in the shadows any more.
Trying to pull off the spooky thing? Not bad, but your technique needs a little work. I'm sure you just need some more practice.\n\nAnyway, stay sharp out there, New-blade. We're not the only scary things lurking in the shadows any more.
What an intriguing inquiry! Attempting to ascertain if I actually like it here or something more subtle?\n\nWell, like or dislike is meaningless. I serve the Matron as I served my former Sanctuary. And as I serve Black Marsh when called upon.
I thought about helping the Rowdy Guar, but the ship's captain is a cheat!\n\nWhat I really want to do is sing. I've serenaded in taverns from Deshaan to Eastmarch. I even received a standing ovation in Orsinium! Unfortunately, Anvil has no taste.
Of course I am. Dancing, drinking, tossing bottles at those who don't do enough of either ….\n\n<<1>> may frown on that local tradition. I'll try to read the crowd.
Well. It seems you do have some sense in your head.\n\nThe wine will help get me through this. As long as it isn't the same slop from the Senche and Serpent.
"Enter, and find peace within."
We deciphered the ledger together. I'd call out a number, she'd find the letter in the book. It was … fun.\n\nShe's so lonely, cooped up in her mansion. She only has mercenaries to keep her company.
Mm. Azurah's purring daughters. This is not ringing chimes?\n\nThe Cantors are nuns … of a sort. We worship the Moons through song, you see? Our nights are long and sacred—full of dozing and bathing and joyful music. It is a lover's vocation.
He did, did he? Last time I saw that spineless skeever, him and Coris the mage were walking away. They left me under here to die.\n\nI heard them talking about the captain and the ambassador as they left.
I understand that since Anais has returned, she's been making inquiries about me. It's clear that her memories of our time together won't let her put the past behind her.\n\nWe need to steal those memories—preferably without getting caught.
<<1>> remembers the Thieves Guild sold many relics to <<2>> of Abah's Landing. My father must have been the one to broker the sales. I want to break into her mansion and pick up on his trail.\n\nWhat do you say … partner?
I tried! You'll see once you have to face those undead necromancers! What they're doing to those pirates is a real shame.\n\nBeing dead? I could live with that. What's happening inside? That's a thousand times worse and one more for good measure!
I suppose that won't do any harm. Narahni is a kind, gentle old woman. And a master baker of scrumptious pies.\n\nThe people here are very fond of her. And very protective.
Many thanks. This will cover five bottles of good food. At least.
Because this one was young and foolish once, full of anger and certain that the moons shone only for me.\n\nSoon, the skooma drowned my memories and it was easier just to forget.
Yes, I suppose I should. But does that mean I abandon my goal to teach Anais a lesson? How will I live with myself if she continues to treat people as things?\n\nI could set her free, but what's the profit in that?
A number of merchant conglomerates operate out of Abah's Landing, using their wealth and power to influence the city. The Thazahrr Cartel is one such entity. I regret to say that I worked for them for a time, before I found a place in the guild.
Never leap into water when you don't know the depth.\n\nI wasn't here, but I wasn't cowering like a newt just free of his shell. There were things that needed doing. Now they are done. All to the benefit of the guild.
We'll continue to rebuild, finish getting our own house in order. I have nothing but admiration and respect for our beloved guildmaster!\n\nIndeed, I can't wait to see what she has planned for us next. The anticipation has me on the edge of my seat!
We return to <<c:1>>, bypass the deadliest traps I've ever encountered, and then scour the treasure vaults for anything we can find.
You flatter me! Come. Her chambers are right over there. You'll find out who the Black Dragon really is soon enough.
Wait, you're <<1>>'s friend! I've seen you both around town. Always kind to me, that one.\n\nI'll tell you what I know.
An old overgrown Daedra shrine frequented by those who value privacy. Nothing to worry about aside from those who've taken roost. I think.
Oh.\n\nTake it from me, it's best not to fall for your guildmaster.
Yes, that is … for the best.\n\nAfter, you must tell me how many fountains you see. A three fountain palace is barely a palace. You need at least five to be respectable.
By Arkay's grace, Exulus and her vile brood must be cleansed and the Hrota Cave made safe once more.\n\nBut make no mistake. Exulus is the root of evil there.
You sound like <<1>>, going on about the whims of nobles. Go ahead, ask him, and feel your head start to spin.\n\nMy head's spinning right now. Different reasons.
Oh, do you now? Look, if I don't know you, you aren't worth knowing. \n\nYou want to earn a name worthy of being on the same card as one of our champions, get in the pit and start drawing in some crowds!
That's perfect. Splendid, even. I'm going to overlook the way you so rudely barged in here and offer you a drink. \n\nJoin me on my balcony. I'm sure you'll appreciate the view.
As with many things, the answer is food. Little grows in Hew's Bane, so food must be imported. The Iron Wheel shipped in their own supplies, but the shipments have stopped.\n\nThis means they plan to leave. No more food, no more Iron Wheel.
<<1>>, our old guildmaster, had a plan to raid the family tomb of a Taneth noble. He died when the heist went bad—so did nearly all the rest. The best of us, cut down when they were needed most.\n\nOnly <<2>> survived. Ugly business.
The name is new to me. But we haven't been keeping as close an eye on the merchant lords as we used to.\n\nWhoever he is, he seems ambitious.
When <<1>> was guildmaster, I convinced him to stop dealing with skooma peddlers. No matter my own thoughts on that poison, it's bad for business.\n\nAnd the Thieves Guild never dealt in slaves. One of the few things <<2>> and I agree on.
That's good to hear.\n\nSee you later, partner.
Someone pinned the blame on the guild. Used to think the Iron Wheel wanted revenge for us trespassing in <<1>>'s family tomb.\n\nBut <<2>> is after the missing dowry—you heard it yourself. No idea who really took it. No idea why.
Not after the merchant lords caught wind. It's good to be the preeminent tailor of Abah's Landing.\n\n<<1>> himself sent a personal apology. Something about excess zeal on the part of his underling.
I'm not sure. Let me get back to you on that after I've had a little more time for everything to sink in.\n\nThere's certainly more politics involved than I was expecting.
Devious traps. Vicious guardians. And likely, at the end of it all, a vault full of dust.\n\nAt least we won't have to worry about the Iron Wheel.
She's too young, too inexperienced. I don't know what Zeira was thinking, allowing that youngling to join the guild.\n\nOh, she's got some raw talent, I'll give you that. But raw talent usually just winds up turning a sweet heist sour, mark my words.
A few. In fact, it was through information gleaned from the first couple of maps we extracted that led us to the ruins in Sentinel. Now all we have to do is get there before someone beats us to the punch.
Questions? At a time like this? As you wish ….\n\nThis one is Razum-dar, just a simple Khajiit who seeks the best for all people of Tamriel. And a soap that won't dry the fur. One day ….
That's what I'm talking about! I got plenty of the ingredients around, but you can get 'em at the grocers' too. \n\nJust toss 'em into one of my charmed mixing bowls and it'll work my magic for you. Perfect cake, every time. Guarantee it.
You've never had one of my Jubilee Cakes? I suppose that makes sense. I don't make them for just anyone, you know.\n\nPeople here in Covenant territory especially enjoy the cake's rich flavor. Comes from the locally sourced flour, of course!
I had my suspicions concerning Mirabelle. Thank you for being honest with me.\n\nIt's time I had a serious talk with our beautiful murderer.
Indeed I did! Kept a low profile in town, spent most of my time in the wilderness. I almost decided to stop running and then I found little Hilde.\n\nShe became my reason to go on living.
And we're a collection of lone assassins. I say let them come. Let them march into our empty halls as the shadows close around them. We are those shadows, cutting them down one by one.\n\nWhen night falls upon the Order, it will be everlasting.
Would it do any good? From what I've heard, everyone who receives these prognosticating pastries dies, despite the explicit warnings.\n\nWho am I to suppose I can avoid the fate that so clearly awaits me?
Best keep looking, then. I've been out here most of the day, but you're the first soul I've seen.\n\nSo many in Kvatch have forgotten the old ways. They're all obsessed with their giant cathedral. They've forgotten how we used to worship. Shame, that.
A sweetroll? How do you know about …?\n\nHmm. Yes, I received a sweetroll. Just as my husband did before he disappeared. What interests are my troubles to you, I wonder?
I thought I did. Well, no, I don't know him that well. I mean, I know people like him. Liars and cheaters who use people and take advantage of their giving nature.\n\nSo Reman hired you to stop the murderer? I find that to be very interesting.
Which clue in specific would you like help with, Raz wonders? But Raz must warn you, I'm better at killing things than at solving riddles.
Yes, well, I'm not making any more progress by complaining to you, am I? Foot to the grindstone, and all that. Hmm. I might be mixing metaphors there. Maybe I should take a nap.\n\nAnyway, it was nice to see you. Don't be a stranger.
Fear is one of the Brotherhood's greatest allies, but we treasure silence as well.\n\nShow me that you are the master of quiet dread. Complete your task without alerting the residents of <<1>> to your presence.
I'm the …?\n\nYou honor me with high praise, intruder. If only I had my armor and weapons, then you'd know for sure.
The client has urged us to destroy a <<1>> before we leave the Cove. A curious request. Nonetheless, tracking down this formula is a fitting challenge. Destroy it and you will be rewarded.
A bard named <<1>>. He is a talentless fool who loiters outside the Cathedral of Akatosh both day and night. One of the Chanters grew weary of his off-key singing and performed the Black Sacrament.\n\nKill this would-be musician.
A chef named <<1>>. She was called to prepare a great feast for House Hlaalu. Alas, she used sour kwama eggs in her famous souffle. Dark Elf nobles are not fond of parties that end with relentless vomiting.\n\nKill this cook.
<<1>>. He's a serial killer who has avoided prosecution for years. Not by stealth, mind you. He's royalty. The chief inspector has grown tired of the lies and obstructions, so he called to us. Ironic, yes?\n\nKill this Elf.
No one still living has my complete trust. I would advise you to walk a similar path in that regard. But I don't believe you're the killer. Not any more. \n\nBut something makes my scales itch. Something I'm missing ….
She's one of the ranking priests at the Cathedral of Kvatch, right below Primate Artorius in the hierarchy. She won't be easy to find, however.\n\nKilling her subordinates may draw her out. Otherwise, rely on Tanek to locate the hole she's hiding in.
I don't expect you to understand and I don't want your help.\n\nThose siege weapons and other preparations the Order is making, by the way. You should do whatever you can to destroy them and disrupt their operations.
A Redguard named <<1>>. Some kind of business dispute I'm told. She refused to sell her mill to a competitor, so he has turned to … less conventional means of negotiation.\n\nSlay this Redguard.
I don't know. It's not a name I'd ever heard before.\n\nTwo of the Celestials identify themselves as the Warrior and the Mage. The third, strangely, calls himself the Serpent—after the thirteenth constellation. The Thief is nowhere to be found.
If this was Glenumbra or Stormhaven we were talking about and not backwater Craglorn, the Covenant would have no trouble finding the resources to help us—Alliance War or not. \n\nBut who am I to complain?
Ask what you will. I'm still looking for answers myself. I had only passed the first trial when these troubles struck the school.\n\nI suppose that's the reason I was able to escape when the others were lost.
I was the master of this school. Its last, as it came to pass.\n\nMy blindness doomed us all. No one could have been as good as Abelazar appeared to be. I should have seen through his trickery.
That is for you to decide. The school has many hidden trials beyond those you've completed, and those too can be undertaken if you wish.\n\nAs for the other Sword-Disciples, they will not reach their final rest until the Serpent himself is defeated.
Hara and the Star-Gazers will help you. Use their knowledge. Look for the presence of the Scaled Court—where they are, the Serpent is surely at work. \n\nBut you must not tell anyone you saw me. The Serpent's followers are everywhere.
Craglorn is the sort of place you go to when you don't want to be anywhere else.\n\nThe people who come here want independence more than anything. The arrangement we had with the mages was mutually beneficial.
I don't remember much of the invasion itself. It failed because of Zal'ik's gambit. Our army proved too strong for the Yokudans.\n\nAs to what happened to them, I don't know. I suppose they gave up in search of an easier target.
Our city was once the great jewel of the desert. A city of cool, crisp, refreshing waters in a sea of sand.\n\nIt would have been of great strategic value to the Yokudans, had they taken it.
There's only one explanation I can think of, and it's not exactly reassuring.\n\nIf someone found the entrance before us and activated it, the residual energy would continue to emanate for a while after. If we go inside, we won't be alone.
I am aware. The Lost One, whom he has corrupted, grows stronger. I hear her calling to me.\n\nThis is why the Serpent divided us. What he could not control whole, he now corrupts piece by piece.
Unfortunate. We will have to find her, then.\n\nI will make my way back to my other selves. Now that I know my location, it will be easy enough to find me.
Hurry. If Kelmen is lost to the Serpent, so too are our chances to understand why the atronachs turned.
You should probably hop a cart back to Elden Root. I can jabber on about Celestials all day long, but I'm a bit out of the loop on the Daedric threat. \n\nMore's the pity. I love how Banekin squeak when you step on them. Ah well.
I'd suggest heading back to Wayrest. The Guild registers there can gauge your aptitude. From the looks of you, I'd say you're a shoo-in. \n\nWalk with Magnus, my friend.
When we fell from the sky, the three gems that power the Seeker's Sight were lost. You will need to retrieve these gems to make use of the relic.
Everything, little goat! Everything!\n\nThe Scaled Court marched into our valley. Honeyed words dripped from their tongues, but it was really venom! They poisoned our chief with their lies and their promises. And when I objected, I was cast out!
It exists only in Upper Craglorn, as far as I know. The locals call it red brittle. They considered it useless until the Scaled Court arrived.\n\nI hoped to gather samples to study, but the Scaled Court has devoured every grain it can get its hands on.
We have a few bad gorapples, same as any big organization. And we have to be tough to provide the level of protection our contracts demand.\n\nBut some of those rumors are just plain mean. We don't break legs unless we absolutely have to.
We need to reach the spawning pools and slay the progenitor mantikora. Once the creature is killed, the Scaled Court won't be able to create more of these monsters.\n\nAnd if any of their prisoners are still alive, we should set them free.
I regret to admit it, but yes. That's where the foul beast gets its intelligence and cunning.\n\nLet's go put an end to this vile operation.
Not only is the rock too brittle to have any real value, it's also a danger to the public welfare. It's poisonous!\n\nThose ignorant dirt-diggers can die in a puddle of their own spittle if they want to, but I can't abide the risk to our operation.
According to the legend, Virmaril was a friend and trusted advisor to High King Durac of Skyreach. Durac depended on him for a great many things.\n\nVirmaril used these catacombs to practice dark sorcery. He and Durac shared a passion for necromancy.
No, not in the way you would think. I believed in the idea of the Serpent. He was the symbol of our cause. But the being that has appeared before us? He's a deceiver. The others are just too blind to see it.
For one such as Regent Cassipia, yes. Very bad. By her own admission, Cassipia plans to remake the world. We cannot allow that to happen.
Well, you didn't have to agree with me so quickly …. \n\nBy the egg ….
Business! And business is good!\n\nWe collect discarded arms and equipment, restore it, and sell it back to whoever can afford it.
Maybe. I could … no. No, thank you. I'm upset. I never kill anyone when I'm upset. Just have to take a moment. Let it simmer, yeah? Put things in perspective. You understand.
Naryu sent a signal to the House Guard in Seyda Neen and that's when the slaver horn started sounding. The slavers must have been hiding nearby and now they're on their way back. We have to hurry!
You are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy morning!\n\nI'll lead the prisoners through the gate and see what we can find to get off this island. You meet up with Naryu at the overlook and then rendezvous with us at the docks.
Peace. Quiet. Some small measure of privacy. Alas, thick-headed adventurers insist on dropping by for long, boring chats.
Of course! Rajhin often tricked the unwary by causing them to underestimate his prowess. This one suspects your "failure" was a gambler's feint.\n\nGo! Prove yourself to all who doubt.
It was night time. I was tired and I think she threw something at me. Hit me in the head. A bottle? She threw a bottle at me, I think.\n\nIt was very confusing, what with all the spells and that red-eyed witch threatening to turn me into a guar.
What, you mean my bare-naked chest? I find shirts and tunics to be too confining. Besides, why would I want to cover up these fabulous tattoos?
Now, I bid you a fond farewell.\n\nYou honored our city by respecting Zoreh's memory. Tall Papa look kindly upon you. May you always find water and shade.
I will. Thank you, friend. May Sithis guide your steps.
Other than the fact that she's in charge of the constabulary? This is a Redoran city. House Redoran demands certainty in all things. Hlaren's deputies won't sanction an arrest unless there is overwhelming evidence. \n\nWe have no proof, only suspicion.
<There are multiple versions of this Dungeon. Which do you want to enter?>
Ha! Is that what we're calling him now?\n\nIt wasn't too long ago slavery was legal in Morrowind. Buying and selling people was legal, right here in Suran. That sound right to you? The Judge keeps us honest. Sometimes, the law just gets in the way.
My, you're well informed. I like that.\n\nI can tell you Constable Mirel went missing a few days ago. Word is he ran afoul of some skooma dealers down in Mazhnch.\n\nMirel had a key to the prison. Find him, and he may let you borrow it.
The Anka-Ra. The cursed Yokudan army that has invaded Craglorn! They serve the Celestial Warrior, but their true master is their general, a man of unmatched cruelty named Tarish-Zi.\n\nI can help defeat him and the Anka-Ra, if you'll only listen.
A small strand of parchment. Tiny, neat script reads: "Glassy and still—a nice catch."
<You are about to enter a Group Dungeon. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
A song. The song. Do you see how it shimmers? Do you see its tones? Its colors? It should help make things clear—make things whole. But it doesn't. It doesn't! It has to be fixed!
I wish I knew. Our resident herbalist, Menwendel, has been developing on a variety of cures. She's capable—brilliant even—but my confidence wanes. We know the illness deadens the mind and causes rigors in the limbs, but beyond that we're stumped.
A royal egg? The Telvanni had a kwama queen just lying around? I guess I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nThis might actually work. It would take an army to shove a full-grown queen through that mine, but an egg? We've got a real chance here!
Sent? How intriguing.\n\nI was just thinking about my former master, Sotha Sil, and the experiments we conducted. He desperately sought to understand the power he and his companions attained—especially whether or not that power was temporary.
Good help is as rare as the legendary Last Dwemer, but a clockwork is only as strong as its weakest cog.\n\nJust work your way up the rainbow. If color isn't clear, examine the crystals. Start with the simplest shape and end with the most complex.
That's the rub.\n\nThe mine is well-guarded. My brother insisted that I hire only the rowdiest and most ill-tempered mercenaries, so I brought on the Iron Hound Company. I can vouch for their pugnacity.
Part of the ritual honoring her ascension from Farseer to Wise Woman. The Wise Women guide the Ashlanders on matters of faith. Even the Ashkhans defer to them. The blindfold represents the need to look beyond what the eyes can see.
Like I said before, Neramo hired Kasouda to lead the dig. She's tough as they come—organized too. She made my job a lot easier, I can tell you that. Most of the time I have to whip the party into shape every now and again. Not with Kasouda.
<You are about to enter a Group Trial. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
Well … I'm not sure how a kwama leg gland could help us, but you certainly get points for creativity.\n\nAh, I just had an idea. Maybe one of these kwama egg-hands could help! They're in poor condition, but they might hum or mumble something useful.
Excellent. Best hand it over to me. Something so dangerous should not fall into the wrong hands. House Hlaalu can keep it safe, or destroy it if we deem it necessary.\n\nThis will earn you some favor with our House. I'll even double your pay.
Where are you from? Children learn of Red Mountain before they even taste flin.\n\nThe mountain sits at the center of Vvardenfell, periodically rumbling like a sleeping nix shaking its leg. Lately, however, it seems to be waking from its long slumber.
More like quarantining myself. I'm a natural disaster masquerading as a person. If I just sit here quietly no one else will get hurt.\n\nBesides, we're out of options. Other than breaking into the mine and planting the egg in the nursery, of course.
Where to?
Safe travels to you.
Sunna'rah? The blessed staff? I suppose the name fits. Sort of.\n\nYou'll need someone to assist you. Someone you trust. Oh, not me. Too busy. Too fragile! But using the tonal inverter is definitely a two-person activity.
Walk with the Three.
Walk with the Three.
I know that! It was either Chodala or the lives of hundreds of Dunmer, all because he convinced himself he was the Nerevarine. Or someone convinced him. \n\nEither way, my brother is dead and the Cavern of the Incarnate has another resident.
I'll contact the Telvanni Council immediately. I'm sure they'll love to hear about Savarak's tawdry affair with those gold-pinchers in House Hlaalu.\n\nIf I know the council—and I do—Savarak will be feeding the shroom beetles by week's end.
Really? Then forget I said anything about his holiness's nasal preening.\n\nThey're some sort of Daedric cultists. They've been performing rituals, calling forth divine power or some such nonsense. At least they were, before the Ashlanders showed up.
Why do you even care? Fine.\n\nI altered the formula, turning the liquid decoction into a vapor. It proved to be very effective. Unfortunately it was nearly impossible to contain. Hence … this.
Varona? Was she still angry with me? No, you don't have to answer that. I know my wife. I'll head back and let her know I'm all right.\n\nTell Lord Vivec he can have our Blessing Stone—as long as he promises to do something about Baar Dau.
Oh yes! I mean, Muthsera Gothren expects unwavering obedience, but on the whole, it's been a delight.\n\nI know he's treated you poorly, but isn't his candor refreshing?
Who's Sotha Sil? That's like asking who are Vivec and Almalexia! They are the Tribunal—the Living Gods of the Dunmer.\n\nSotha Sil is the architect of time and the binder of Oblivion. If you want to know more, we can talk after we've finished.
Vassamsi? You mean Gothren's slave-prison? What in the name of—? I know he distrusts me now, but you can't let him do this. If the truth of our relationship gets back to the Council ….\n\nI'll go to the mine. Maybe I can talk him out of this.
What? My brother has always been interested in the Ashlanders. Even showed them a kindness the rest of the House doesn't approve of.\n\nBut for him to kill someone, especially one of his own soldiers, something terrible must have happened.
Most of them. Might be a random contraption or a wandering factotum still out there. And if Barbas smuggles in more Daedra, the other defenses will become active.\n\nClear a path while I open the route, then I'll catch up and join you.
Lord Vivec's intervention stopped the moonlet from crashing into the city. He holds it above us by strength of will. But as he weakens, so too does the power that keeps the rock afloat.\n\nIf Vivec's energy wanes further, it would spell disaster.
We sing the truth songs. The truth of the three blasphemers, and the Daedra, and the Nerevarine. The Houses hate us most of all.
There is little to learn. We put on no airs—we have no taste for secrets. Only hard work matters.\n\nThe other tribes burden themselves with resentments and sour traditions. Not us. We speak little. Our labors speak for us.
Really, outlander, it's commendable that you're trying to learn our ways, but the words of the Tribunal just sound silly when you say them like that. I suggest you stick to sight-seeing and leave the religion to us.
Maybe. You'll have to ask him—provided he's not dead already.\n\nKhartag's a hard Orc to know. I always thought he was a stone-hearted businessman, but then some horker out in the Rift told me he was a big-time Covenant hero—so what do I know?
Very little. The Queen of Dawn and Dusk rarely talks about it.\n\nI know that the Dark Elf Tribune, Sotha Sil, summoned eight Daedric Princes to a summit in Coldharbour. They argued for months, but eventually gave in to Sotha Sil's demands.
I can't agree to that. I need to figure out what happened to my brother. Who was involved. And then I'm going to make them pay. Just you watch!
We make regular runs between here and Vivec City. We can also take you to Molag Mar, if you prefer. Do either of those destinations appeal to you?
I told her what she wanted to hear. I was with Captain Ulran the day everything happened.\n\nI was commanded to lure the Ashlanders to town and set up a situation for Ulran to deal with.
You did what? I suppose you thought that was a good idea?\n\nWell, the damage is done. At least tell me you found something to make this debacle a little more palatable.
Cooperate with House Redoran and hold your tongues. It's as simple as that. I shall return to the council meeting and conclude our business. When we're finished, I expect you and Naryu to both be gone.\n\nThat is all, outlander.
Forbade is such a complicated concept. It assumes that the rules are applied equally to everyone, and we both know the foolishness of that assumption.\n\nThe Warclaws have a long-standing contract that pre-dates any proclamations by the councilor.
Just some gibberish the Temple came up with. They contain enough technical terms to appear legitimate, but say nothing that's actually going to help the moon-sugar's growth. It should keep the bandits trying and trying, with no success.
Of course you don't. Of course you don't! \n\nUgh. I tire of this conversation. The others are bad enough. Be off! I have work to do.
You've never seen an illusion dazzler? You're in for a treat!\n\nThey're the pinnacle of awe-inspiring emanations! Radiant in color, resonant in percussion, slightly malodorous, and only harmful under the most ill-thought out circumstances.
Magister Gothren reigns over Tel Aruhn—the fungal tower west of here. He has a sour reputation, but remains one the most powerful mages in Tamriel.\n\nI never had cause to work for him, but Eoki did. He doesn't like to talk about it.
I, um, no. This is embarrassing. It started … talking to me. Then I swooned and passed out. Spiders have that effect on me.\n\nOh, I must return to Lady Laurent. It's well past her tea time and she's going to be extremely displeased with me.
Ulran always had an unnatural attraction to the Ashlanders and their savage ways. He felt that an Ashlander life was worth more than a Redoran life. The Council didn't agree with his assessment.\n\nThis will all be over as soon as Ferhara finds Veya.
I suppose. I still can't figure out how the priest was able to control their minds using spiders. It's a bafflement.\n\nMaybe one of these scrolls I seized on the way out will shed some light on this final mystery.
Neria works at the stables. She's always been good with guar, something she inherited from her mother. Mils will likely be fishing on the canal, for dinner. He's always kept them both fed.\n\nI'm so proud of both of them. I wish they understood.
I don't see how that's any of your business. I've nothing to say to my father or those his Telvanni master employs.
An end to this curse. Once and for all. I may be at the mercy of Molag Bal, but I will slake my thirst on his servants until my voice is heard.\n\nAnd if they deliver me to Coldharbour for eternal torment, at least I will no longer be this.
That's what the handbook says. Look, I know what Naryu's done for me. To keep me safe. I appreciate that.\n\nBut this is about what they did to my brother. Nothing else matters. Not Naryu. Not you. And certainly not me.
Ah. I see the n'wah is well-informed. If you know that I am Savarak, you must also know that I rule Vos as its wizard-magistrate. Do you bring me some petition, or is this just a social visit?
A thousand times, yes!\n\nOur Mistress has a mixed reputation. Outsiders often say she is cold and calculating. That may be, but I don't mind. She cares for us from a distance—intervening only when necessary. She respects our freedom.
Sorry, but I skipped school the day they taught Dwarf machine-magic. Got no idea, friend.\n\nI could hazard a guess. Looks a little like my pa's old jaw harp. So maybe it makes music or something? Some kind of death-music I bet. Damn Dwarves.
If my benefactor wished to discuss details in the open, why send a messenger? The matter is for your ears only.
I'd assumed you knew whose home it was you were standing in.\n\nDivayth Fyr. Does that name's significance escape you as well?
For your sake, I hope you're more prepared for what's to come.\n\nAs for me, you could say I am a practitioner of magic. If you were partial to understatement. I am the premiere authority on extra-planar travel. My writings are taught the world over.
Alchemy, from the looks of it, though I see a few components related to Daedric magic.\n\nDead spiders, vials, various alchemical components … this must be how these mind spiders were created. They certainly don't appear to be natural creatures.
I did.\n\nPulling Daren and Brerayne out wasn't too hard, but Lotaeel was anxious to dole out some justice along the way. Ended up stabbing and hacking our way out. We really stirred up the hornets' nest. Now Lenarmen's thugs are on high alert.
If you know the legend of Pelinal Whitestrake and Saint Alessia, you are on the path to understanding.\n\nIf not, well … those who accept the blessing are renowned for their brave deeds in days thereafter. Surely that's something your people value?
Tel Aruhn? Well, it's the big tower over there where Magister Gothren lives. And I'm sure this will surprise you, but he's not too keen on outlanders. I'd stay out of his way if I were you.
That device in the mine was silenced, but I can still feel its song.
I'm gathering research for Librarian Bradyn. He has a very ambitious project underway, so this assignment is the definition of prestigious.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about his grand project, you should visit the library in Vivec City.
When the Pact formed I told myself it was time to visit our newfound allies. So I've been to the swamps of the lizards and the lands of the puny Elves.\n\nIt's been a great journey so far, but Keba hates to travel.
Ever since our agreement with the Pact went into effect, slavery has been outlawed throughout most of Morrowind. But all we did was drive the slavers into the shadows.\n\nThis whole stinking event has their bloody fingerprints all over it.
With that busybody Marshal Hlaren and her Iron Hounds interfering with the watch, there's no work left for an honest constable!\n\nOn the other hand, I guess we could use a vacation ….
Your help is appreciated. I can fend for myself, but conjuring these wards is taxing and establishing a spirit barrier is only the first step.\n\nI must continually channel the flow of magic to maintain it for any extended period of time.
Largest city in the hold and seat of the Jarl. If anywhere's safe from these rabid Reachmen, it's there.
His shadow? By the Hist, what have you gotten into this time, little brother …?\n\nTake me to Neelo. I will make him see reason. He always feels safer when I am by his side.
With any luck Torik and some others can get here before it comes to that, but if not, I will delay the enemy as long as I can. No point in sacrificing anyone else for such a cause.
That's something, at least … I've agreed to attempt my experiment again with Sovor as my subject. He's promised to petition the order to end my exile if I'm successful, but I couldn't care less about that.\n\nI just want this to be over.
Maybe you haven't been here long, but I'm sure you noticed that Clockwork isn't the safest place in Tamriel. You'll have to go through some dangerous spots to collect these supplies. \n\nBut hey, you look like you can handle yourself.
Interesting question. As far as I know, no new apprentices have entered the Wellspring since Gathal's accident.\n\nBut I have a bigger concern. At least Chirrhari can grow mushrooms. My plants refuse to live, no matter what I do.
Idrono? His experiment was doomed from the beginning. You can't grow plants without a source of nourishing light. My plants thrive thanks to the use of Lector Naril's simulated sunlight.\n\nBut I wasn't informed we were getting new apprentices ….
That business in Orsinium … you were one of King Bazrag's most powerful advocates, yes?\n\nI need someone who can fight and parley with equal skill. As a warrior and kingmaker, you will do splendidly.
I know of two—one east, one west. Look for the hidden caves where the shadows gather in force. Once you find a gate, you need only let yourself sink into it. \n\nI can't promise you'll like where you end up.
I suppose Lector Naril could have more apprentices toiling in his private workshop. He keeps numerous secrets, so what's a few more?\n\nYou can enter the workshop through the busted vent over there. Ignorance of his rules might grant you some leeway.
Yeah, the grease mucks up fabricant snoots. That's why we stay down here. Wouldn't want the constables to see …. Never mind!\n\nYour man headed west. Should be some oily footprints about. Follow those tracks and you'll find your fancy-boots.
Ah, yes, their bizarre sponsorship custom. I forgot about that little wrinkle. As a friend and peer of Sotha Sil, I come and go as I please.\n\nI suppose it would be best for you to wait out here. If I need you again, I will find you.
I did! Just be careful with it. The teeth are as sharp as Mehrunes' Razor, and the motor's a little temperamental.\n\nOne thing—if it starts to smoke, just drop it and find cover. I'm not saying it's going to explode but … it might explode.
Yes! Daft talking crows. They plucked it right out of my bureau and flew off with it. Those Whispering Shadows cultists will never find it now.
That's the spirit! I managed to yank this sword out of a corpse nearby. It's not much, but you don't need a sharp edge to deal with these factotums—just a heavy swing and a lot of patience.\n\nYou ready? Let's get moving.
I know the Astronomer's power is fading. I feel it. He needs to transfer his power, and soon. If he dies before another apprentice could be found ….\n\nThe Planisphere needs me. My god needs me. Can I really be so selfish?
You would take up the Blackfeather banner? Tempting! The Exarchs use wingless allies to shoot down my vassals and scatter my treasures. But if we had a giant of our own …. Very well, I accept!\n\nGo! Destroy the Exarchs, and the key is yours. Yours!
Collects, cleans, redistributes. Does it all, really.\n\nIt also creates water moisture in the air, producing a hospitable environment for natural life. I'm not sure if we would die of thirst or desiccation first, were it to completely shut down.
Good. Sil's lecture should begin any moment now. Stand ready to activate the lamp.\n\nI'm reasonably certain that something will happen, but the specifics elude me. I guess this is what uncertainty feels like. What a novel change of pace.
Exactly so. It seems Dark Elf blood runs a little deeper here than they'd like to admit.\n\nI was an outsider, and compared to many here my magic is still weak at best. I'm sure my round ears also didn't help make an impression. But I was determined.
Oh, I'm certain you'll have to. But trust me when I say that factotum is doing more harm than good. If we let it be then it will just destroy all the repairs I've set into place! I'm sure of it!\n\nNot that I think we'll be given a choice.
Yet there's always demand for Soul Gems. Funny that.\n\nYou aren't wrong about this lot though. They're bringing in corpses by the wagon-load, erecting wards, gathering materials. Preparing, but I haven't discovered what for.
Funny you should ask. I lost a compressor to <<1>> in that slaggy trade. You could try to get it from him. Or better yet, just beat it out of him.\n\nIf that doesn't suit, you could pull one out of a verminous fabricant. They're all over the Radius.
Yes, he was acting strangely, wasn't he? He always chafed under Lord Seht's rule. Now, he finally has a pretext to seize control and he slinks away like a broken brassilisk.\n\nCurious. Too curious.
I am Aios, the Automata Incarnum Overseer System. Master Sil created me to maintain and supervise the substrata operations of Clockwork City.\n\nThis partition can provide answers to class-seven queries only. Thank you for your understanding.
Fantastic! Now, let me fill you in on the details.\n\nI found this factotum head in a junk pile, which isn't too uncommon for the Brass Fortress. I was intrigued, however, by its strange coloring. I was even more intrigued when it began to speak to me!
When the gears align, the world rotates at a pleasing pace. I'll run straight to the portal and back to the Clockwork City!\n\nOh, but if you haven't already, please locate my research notes. I dropped them when they captured me.
My lover, when I was still an apostle. He was mortally wounded in an accident, beyond any hope of survival, but I couldn't accept that. I was enlightened! So, I saved his life by transferring his spirit into a factotum.
You've never heard of the Evergloam? It's the Oblivion realm that belongs to Nocturnal, the Night Mistress. I'm sure this Shadow Cleft represents some sort of attack on the Clockwork City, but there's only so much I can determine in my current state.
You're right. I can be the bigger person and apologize. I am her older and smarter brother, after all. \n\nLet's return to the Brass Fortress. Perhaps you can talk to her first and see how Kireth is doing? She's probably lost and distraught without me.
Poem. A collection of thematically appropriate statements and metaphors arranged in stanzaic sequence, including title and required punctuation. Yes, this unit has composed a poem. I hope it meets your specifications.\n\nMay Seht bless your labors.
Initializing … reflecting … reflecting … unauthorized prophetic element engaged.\n\nAnalyzing proximate subject … determining wealth and social status …. Permission to continue?
I'm sorry to say that when I was a young man, I came across a sequence plaque that belonged to one of Sotha Sil's original assistants. An apostle called Albacron.\n\nThe plaque contained a series of passphrases. That's how I found the lost treasure.
Oh! Well, I mean, you could—sure. It's just … I could never pay you back for something like that. Just one cut costs more than I'll even have in my life down here.
No, Raynor needs some alone time. We both do. No sense starting the same fight all over again.\n\nYou go talk to Raynor. Help him work things out so we can get back to our usual sibling rivalry. Just don't let him know I sent you.
Like most things in Clockwork, our clothing is given to us by Seht's grace. It's hard to notice at first glance, but our manufactured cloth is woven with metallic threads. Still not sure why, but hey, don't mock the polish of a gifted spring.
To meddle further was to risk doing even greater damage. It was always the hope that the Saints might one day recover, or at least achieve lasting stability. Altering the experiment was intended to be a last resort.
Nocturnal was not present when the Princes signed the Coldharbour Compact. Thus she flouts its restrictions.\n\nNow, this is important—Nocturnal does not act alone. Two other Princes lie in wait. Clavicus Vile and Mephala.
What? You managed to recover the gro-Morkul clan's Ancestral Sword? Let me see that.\n\nBy Mauloch's jawbone, it is the sword! Returned after all this time. Another reason we knew Aunt Dulza was dead. She'd never let that sword be lost.
These firepot spiders contain a highly unstable oil-like fluid. The dangers inherent to acquiring it make it very valuable indeed.\n\nI discovered a way to prevent the spiders from detonating, but even defused they're more than capable of killing me.
Information restricted due to current citizen status. Please contact a local Clockwork Apostle representative for more information.
What? No, no, no. I have too many responsibilities here. And to leave Seht's side? It's an absurd suggestion. No offense, of course. Clockwork City is my home. I have no desire to leave. No desire at all.\n\nNow we have work to do, right?
It clearly possesses some great power.\n\nKeys exist to lock and unlock doors, right? I assume they want to unlock something.
You asked him that? After all the impatience I showed you? The bad temper? I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I've never met a more altruistic soul.\n\nStill, I'm not sure even Sotha Sil could save me this time. I feel it in my bones. This is how I end.
Oh no. Not yet. Not yet! Our mischief's not done. We still have shadow women to peck, and cultists to chase, and shinies to steal!
I'd mostly accepted that there would be no end to my punishment, I don't know that I can believe all this might work out in the end.\n\nI'll be watchful, not hopeful, for a while yet.
It has exacerbated tensions that already exist.\n\nThe Sapiarchs see this murder as evidence of our negligence. Members of the guild resent it. So we're caught in something of a downward spiral.
Only my vessel can repair the Dawnbreaker. Use the Dawnstar Gem to locate Darien within the Spiral Skein. Now return to the Ritemaster and tell him what I said.\n\nWait. The triad dares to invade my sacred realm? Such an affront cannot stand!
No, no, no. You can't believe her. She's um … she's lying. I attacked Haladan. I killed him! You're making this up! No one will believe it!
And that involves traveling to places Raz never knew existed before all this started. No, Raz will see Sadara to safety and then do what he can to protect Summerset and the Crystal Tower.\n\nThe Daedra fighting Raz will leave to you, yes?
A disturbing development to be sure, but we'll have to hope Meridia can protect herself.\n\nI'll open a portal to Mephala's Spiral Skein when you're ready. Then you can use the gem to find the Golden Knight.
Well, that is a surprise.\n\nAs farcical as your investigation might have been, I appreciate your willingness to side with the facts. It does much to restore my opinion of the Mages Guild in Lillandril.
<The ledger flashes dimly.>
Ooh, a Sea Elf! I've heard they have the largest and most attractive ships on the open sea. Your brave captain is one lucky sailor.\n\nNow, to me! What do you want to ask me? What would you like to know about Clever?
Yes. Once his identity is revealed to all, the House of Reveries cannot allow him to join. That is their requirement, is it not? To keep their identities secret?\n\nOnce the spell they've cast on him is broken, I'm certain Layrdel will leave with me.
Ugh. That's two mothers that will want my head. \n\nAll right. I'll follow … at a distance. I've had enough excitement for one lifetime.
Because I could. Because even an Altmer's longevity was not enough to find what I was seeking. \n\nYou can put that on my grave: here lies Caluurion, whose reach forever exceeded his grasp.
I've been hearing this voice since I first started translating these inscriptions. It must be some sort of magic, connected to the inscriptions. Perhaps connected to the language itself, come to think of it.
Sea Sload? Plus all this nonsense about Altmer superiority? And now … murder?\n\nI am the Canonreeve of Rellenthil! I took an oath to serve and protect my community. How in the Queen's name am I supposed to reconcile my son's actions?
Of course I did. Why would I let you have one of the last, if not the last, surviving blooms? If you take that plant, the species may be wiped out for good.\n\nDid you ever, in your obsession with paint, think about what you're taking from Summerset?
Well, I could speak to how those supplies would be used in the service of art that touches the soul of mer and man, but I feel my words would not move you. So, let's try another venue then, shall we? I'll double whatever payment Tindoria has offered.
Yes, back when I had the inclination to bother with such upstarts. I thought that would be my legacy, to train great artists who would blossom under a careful eye. \n\nSadly, all they did was rot in their own hubris.
New around here, eh? Halimorion was a sap-arsed dandy—slapping Wood Elves with one hand and groping them with the other. The Ghost of the Green just did what the Prosecution wouldn't.\n\nGood riddance.
Murdered? No. Executed! Executed by a righteous hand. Just have a look around, outsider. I'll bet my horns you'll find evidence of misdeeds. This was a long time coming. Hopefully it put these other long-legged prigs on notice!
I'll stay here and try to assist with the ritual. You go and help Darien and Razum-dar.\n\nWe need to buy the Sapiarchs enough time to attune themselves to the diamond keys.
What, are you the kind of sap who sheds a tear for every idiot lost on a job? Eh.\n\nIf you're so worried, what are you standing around here for? Go in and find her. Maybe she's still alive. Most likely not, but there's still a chance.
I'm great! It will take more than the venom of some giant spider lady to kill me.\n\nOh, what a great first chapter. "Stealing into the caverns of Eton Nir, Lady Twilight would meet her first deadly foe … and her first ally!" That's you, by the way.
Hildegrom? She's my favorite hero! I'm sure that one of my Nord gifts will inspire Enigma and help her find the voice of the battle maiden.\n\nBut which one do you think will make her feel like a proper Nord?
An excellent treasure! This was King Jorunn's prized pet, Baadir, known for her bravery. She once faced down a horde of rampaging Orcs!\n\nThe Skald King stuffed and mounted her for display, but found it too depressing to keep on the mantle.
The Psijic Order? We have not heard from that body of august sages in quite some time, and then word comes that we should expect a visitor.\n\nWhy does the Ritemaster send you to see the Sapiarchs? Speak true if you want our assistance in this matter.
This involves the business that Razum-dar was telling us about? The Queen's cat claimed he had eyes in the Psijic Order, but we assumed that was more of his braggadocio.\n\nVery well. We'll send word to Lillandril that you may cross to the College.
You do? It's good we consider you as charming as you are interesting.\n\nThe Sapiarchs teach us and guide us, bringing their knowledge to every part of Altmer society. Their compound in Lillandril serves as the seat of their college.
Good, good. I was about to turn that insignificant book duster into something small, wet, and slimy. It would have made matters worse, but it might have brightened the dark mood I've been in.\n\nSorry. I don't mean to burden you with my troubles.
Oh, no, I seriously doubt that. At first glance I'd say the High Elves built it, and that it's had a very far fall from grace. We should look for anything that can provide a more detailed account of what happened here!
Even if I'm not bludgeoned off stage by thick volumes, I'm told the Divine Prosecution is very particular about the, uh, verbiage used to present the truth. I'd prefer to receive their critiques by mail.
I wouldn't think so. She left all her things in her room. Notes, valuable tomes. Not the sorts of items a sage would leave behind. Maybe she just got caught up in the nonsense outside.\n\nYou can examine her room if you'd like. It's right over there.
It means you need to find the Oracle and make sure she's all right. I enchanted a small boat to take you to an isolated part of Bangkorai, near her last known location.\n\nAnd take this medallion of summoning. Use it to call upon me if the need arises.
No. No, I can't live like this. Serving the very beasts who took everything away from me.\n\nJust … end it. Please. I'd rather die than be miserable. You can take my signet ring. That will prove to Esterdel that you found my corpse.
Not this time. Raz must go back and lead the Divine Prosecution in defense of Summerset. If the Crystal Tower keeps exploding, we will evacuate the island and save as many people as we can.\n\nMay the luck of Jone and Jode be with you, my friend.
They seem to think this disease they've concocted is a blessing, one that they're happy to share with the rest of Tamriel. The whole thing's repulsive. \n\nI haven't been this pleased to end someone's miserable existence in a long time.
You're what? Well … that's as may be. I'm sorry if I offended you, but you're clearly the exception. A half-starved vampire recovering from some rare illness is dangerous. Period.
Give you the—? What, do you think I have a boat in my pocket? That it folds up and fits in your backpack? Ridiculous!\n\nIt's nearby, on the docks. I'll mark the location on your map.
The Divine …. Did a justiciar send you to harass me? I've lived in Summerset my whole life and I did nothing wrong!\n\nYou High Elves! You say we're welcome and then you treat us like criminals! Is there any wonder I had to speak out?
What do beggars expect … coin? Pity?\n\nMaybe that's too obvious. You should read his story. I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Not in the least. After all, I was the one who suggested the idea to the High Magistrate. In my experience, newcomers are well-suited to the incidents we need to contract out.
You're attuned to Artaeum and have a connection to the Psijic Order now. The portal will always be open for you. And you'll always be welcome on our hidden island.
Very little, I'm afraid. The last time I passed through that area was more than three-hundred-and-fifty years ago. They made an exquisite wine, as I recall, and the House of Reveries theater troupe always put on an entertaining show.
Reluctant? Perhaps. But I'm also a realist. I'll accept help wherever I can find it if it means the survival of Summerset.\n\nBesides, it's not like I have a lot of other options in this matter.
Eluvein is another name for the hilas owl. Eluveins lay their eggs, then abandon them. We use that word to describe people who are cold-hearted or aloof.\n\nThen there's the bodies, arranged to mimic Mara's cross. This is about love. Intimacy.
Without more information, there's no target for our marines to focus on. Besides, I don't have an army at my disposal right now. The majority of our forces are committed to the continent and the Three Banners War.\n\nI must rely on the forces at hand.
Two Resolute Diamonds … imbued with the power of Mephala! Now they merge into a single gem … one Resolute Anchor to serve as both key and safeguard!\n\nDo not lose this. Only its presence will keep you and your companions anchored to this reality.
Sea Sload magic. Something to do with abyssal pearls. The geysers spout … terrible sea creatures and undead. B'Korgen … the Sea Sload … is working to increase their power.\n\nOur report contains … all the details.
Without more information, there's no target to attack. Besides, I don't have an army at my disposal right now. The majority of our forces are committed to the continent and the Three Banners War.\n\nI must rely on the forces at hand.
In Summerset, family stands above all. They guide your life, almost immeasurably. To be without family is to be unseen, unrecognized as a member of our society.\n\nThere's not much of a life a hulkynd can make for themselves because of that.
For Lorne, logic is an art. She's clinical in her sensibilities. Precise. Many of us have come to rely on magical inquiry to solve crimes. She relies on her wits and intuition instead.\n\nOf course, this case presents unique challenges ….
No! Not possible. Investigator Vale said one of us is guilty, and it weren't me. She's clever as a one-eyed shark that one. Vale's never wrong. Never!
What? You want me to believe that Investigator Vale got this wrong? Ha! Preposterous!\n\nThe pirate's to blame. Just look at all these crumbs! Only a sloppy mariner would make such a mess.
The Divine Prosecution serves as lawkeepers and protectors of social standards. Very persnickety.\n\nWhen rules are broken, they record it in their observation logs. If your name winds up on their list, things get complicated.
You saved Pavo! Well done! You should find the others.\n\nPerhaps you could help Tanelwen next? She was interrogating two of my fellow students in the lecture garden.
Yes! I think Pavo is still in the grip of this … whatever this is. The last time I saw him, he was begging for alms by the eastern wall.
She has spoken against it. Now Raz needs to know how far she will go to defy the will of the Queen. Does she grumble but welcome the newcomers, or is she using every option at her disposal to block their arrival? Raz will find out—with your help.
They told me I could fill out some forms and appeal to the Kinlady, but who has time for such bureaucracy? And for a Wood Elf?\n\nI've said too much. I have work to do and all this aggravation has diverted my Path to Alaxon.
An excellent question, and one I hope to find the answer to. From the evidence before us, it appears this Nord killed the Skaafin before he succumbed to his own wounds. Good for him.\n\nI found this key on the creature's belt, so we can open that door.
Stars! I've seen wild mammoths charge the enclosure walls, but they usually give up pretty quickly. I've never seen one driven to battering itself to death. Not by anger. Not even by panic.
Or more likely, someone I failed to love.\n\nThere's only one suspect left. A mer with means, motive, and deep understanding of the Ghost of the Green ….
I mean, this is a crisis. Lotus is the prize of the menagerie. She wouldn't ….\n\nThis is insane, you know that? What do you need from me?
We received word that there was the potential for trouble in Summerset, so the Ritemaster sent me to take a look.\n\nEven so, Artaeum isn't a prison. We're Psijic mages! We can come and go as we like, just so long as it advances our studies.
That's right. And, despite my bellyaching, I'm not an Orc who goes back on his word. That being said, I do have a reputation to uphold. This little meeting stays between us.\n\nKing's Haven Pass. That's where you need to go.
Intriguing. I've never seen this dialect before. I can translate it, but I need more to work with. I need to examine the original tablets found at Ebon Stadmont.\n\nThat will never happen, of course. You do remember I'm a prisoner here, don't you?
Borrowed! I was going to put it back! Honestly, I don't even know why we have a Library of Shrieking Terror! This is a school for Auri-El's sake!\n\nI just wanted to impress Glardir. I thought that if I showed her the book, she'd think more of me.
While it's true that the Court consists primarily of High Elves who believe their birthright is the key to godhood, I am not so naive.\n\nNocturnal selected me as her earl. She taught me that loyalty is the path to ascension. And my loyalty is strong.
He happened along after our people started vanishing and he's got reason to want us gone. Raises an eyebrow, yeah?\n\nAll I'm suggesting is maybe it's time someone started pressuring him for details.
Of course, but they are little help. Can't spare time for criminal mischief. It seems sullying our pristine lands doesn't count among the worst things all these nebarra are up to.\n\nIt's obvious who the culprit is, but I lack proof, so he runs free.
You know how important lineage is to our people. We should have preserved everything we could about this place, but instead, nothing.\n\nI must know why this place was buried. Figuratively and literally.
Thank Y'ffre for that. It'll take some time for them to die off, but they'll be too sick to hurt anyone soon.\n\nCould you explain that to the good officers of the law here? How this was all an unfortunate accident and I helped make it right?
They preserved us from the sickness of the sea. For that we will be eternally grateful.
Shiny, fake, and worthless. The Elves talk about this place like it's perfect, but they lie to themselves, and especially to Men.\n\nEven our paradise above was a thin veneer over this ugliness. If I live, I'll be glad to be gone.
My vain attempt to stop the sickness from spreading beyond our borders. The people rebelled against their confinement and nearly broke the quarantine. I was forced to destroy the sea walls and flood the town.
To be free of the disease is to be free of all humours. They offer us their tainted blood to sustain our fragile grip on life and through sorcery the sickness is purged. Together we flee its horrors, but there was no true escape. Until now.
Like many other crafting materials, you'll find pewter dust within the wilderness. Try searching within the outskirts of the city. I happen to know there's a rich vein nearby.
I haven't isolated the source of the mind magic, except that the malevolent entity calls itself K'Tora. It imprisoned you in the mind trap in order to control you, but to what purpose I'm not sure.
I can see you speak in earnest. But if what you say is true, then we cannot wait. The Battlereeve must know this, immediately.
Sounds like the reasonable thing to do, doesn't it? Oh no, but she'd rather berate me.\n\nI'm old enough to know that when a brat throws a tantrum, you just be patient. But she'd put any toddler to shame with this performance.
It was a big rat.\n\nDon't worry, it's dead now.
All of us have grown up on tales of Gjadil the Keel-Hauler and her Summerset treasure! The way Auntie Brinkela tells it, whoever opens the chest will have enough wealth to last them a life time.\n\nOf course, I was happy with a quarter share.
A fine. Not even a huge fine, but my waters ran dry not long after I arrived here.\n\nThey're just looking for an excuse to bully an Argonian.
That's because I'm not. Dryskin over here has it in for me now.\n\nSays I've been seen trespassing on some noble's land. Valenbear, or something. Even if I did, all I was doing was taking a shortcut. Or I was until I took a nap.
The Crystal Tower has its own protections, though we know those have been weakened with the removal of the Heart of Transparent Law.\n\nStill, we tried to acquire the Resolute Diamonds, the Sapiarchs' keys to the tower.
You didn't come here to listen to a grown woman bawling about her father to a stranger. Forgive me.\n\nYou did enough bringing him home safe. What comes after is up to me.
Right. You're new to the Isle. I apologize.\n\nApraxic Mer are people who, for whatever reason, were expelled from the greater Elven community. Most aprax labor for years to reenter society. Others choose to remain in exile. I feel very sorry for them.
What's to investigate? That dreadful person from the Mages Guild confessed! \n\nOh, I suppose Soraturil wants all the details recorded. He is, after all the Sapiarch of Procedural Dynamics.
Someone who's not a High Elf, of course. \n\nIf you're going to live within Summerset, I strongly suggest you learn our vocabulary. It's the least you visitors can do.
The Divine Prosecution are great at stopping crime and rooting out sedition, but stuff like this—things that go bump in the night—that's when you need a specialist.\n\nI'm very special.
It really is hopeless, isn't it? Father won't be happy, but I'll tell him I tried.\n\nIf I'm lucky my books from the College of Sapiarch will be waiting by the time I get home.
The what now? No—forget I asked. Save it for Hy. He's way more interested in all this intrigue nonsense. I'll stick to gut-punching hungry monsters.
Its purpose wasn't to open the portal, though its power does pose some concerns. It would be heresy to destroy an Aldmer artifact, but I will recommend that those ruins be patrolled regularly from now on.
A trip to the apothecary and the keep's wine rations, not necessarily in that order. Fortunately, I don't need to be fighting fit to review evidence.\n\nI hope that by the time Lindafwe, Silurie, and I are fully on the mend we'll have some solid leads.
The Psijic Order isn't just a collection of wizards. It's a world-view, you know? A state of mind.\n\nIt's not enough to be a talented mage. You have to learn to see things in a different way. To cultivate a detached and virtuous perspective.
The Staff of Towers has returned. I was skeptical at first, but there is no longer any room for doubt.\n\nJosajeh made the discovery—an exemplary feat of arcane inquiry. I find myself filled with a mentor's pride … and no small measure of dread.
Excellent. I will find a safe place for them here in the Ceporah Tower.\n\nFour less artifacts in the world eases my mind considerably. Once we find the remaining four fragments, our task will be complete.
Some force keeps drawing the fragments back together. Despite my best efforts, they resist any attempt to fully separate them.\n\nI have tried safes, vaults, warding cases … but every time, the fragments manage to reunite.
If any society of mages can do it, it is the Psijic Order.\n\nYou will no doubt be pleased to hear that Josajeh has gained some valuable perspective. We spoke at length, and now she seems committed to disassembling the staff.
He … he'd entrust this to me? After all I did? How I disappointed him?\n\nI don't know what to say. Actually, come to think of it, I do. I will never disappoint my mentor again. I may be exiled, but the Augur and I will make a better world.
First? I think I'll go home. To the Alik'r. I have a lot of ghosts to confront—choices to make peace with. Changing the past was always a mirage. All we can do is face it and persevere.
As your knowledge of the Old Ways grows, so too will the rewards. For instance, we are prepared to teach you new and powerful spells.\n\nAs in all things, the best teacher is experience. This matter of the time breaches will act as your exam.
I promise we will work with the Proxy Queen to make sure the Crystal Tower remains safe. I'll begin preparations immediately. \n\nWe'll even allow the Divine Prosecution and the Mages Guild to participate in these efforts.
They know enough. They know a mighty Psijic mage cast off her gray cloak to help them rebuild her ancestral home. These mages are smart enough to avoid questions they don't want answered.\n\nHonestly, our discovery would only burden them.
I told myself the secret would be safe with her. That it would be impossible to circumvent the barrier seal even if it was found out. I was lying to everyone. Even myself.\n\nMy selfishness brought this about. That fact sticks like a knife in my gut.
Justiciar Avanaire. She struck me down, ran off to this ruin.\n\nI was able to follow her this far. The rest of my squad went in after her, but I fear the worst. With that pearl, who knows what she's capable of?
What do I care about Brengas? Honestly, I'd rather leave the two love birds to their fate.\n\nBut if word got out that I left Niralin to die, or if she managed to escape and actually marry that Wood Elf …. Suffice to say, I can't just leave her.
Oh yes, she and Cartorrel have been together for years. She used to look after me when I was younger, while father and the others were off at sea. She's a good friend.
The sea took her mother. She was an officer in the Royal Navy, like me. She'd just returned to duty after our daughter was born when the Sea Elves struck at Auridon.\n\nUgly year. The tempest that washed her overboard was red as Russafeld wine.
Where our family was born. We spent many a night under that old tree along the coast of Wasten Coraldale.\n\nI'll be damned if I was going to let the Sea Elves take that from me too.
A few insignificant echoes and a name to apply to it, but nothing to tell us who created it or what kind of magic it employs. It isn't Daedric in origin, though, despite the false Aldarch's allegiance.\n\nIt's time to utilize more drastic means.
I am precisely as concerned as I need to be, but I don't see how that's any of your business.\n\nIf Durell hadn't put me in this very awkward position, I wouldn't need to be concerned at all.
The staff will either shatter into eight inert fragments, or ….
I'm sorting through the many wonders that Sotha Sil saw fit to leave behind.\n\nSilly as it may sound, this study has been left alone for hundreds of years. Out of respect for Sotha Sil's privacy, of course.
Mostly, I'm just trying to help Valsirenn. As long as she's the Ritemaster, that's where my allegiance lies.\n\nShe's better at the job than she thinks, even if she considers it a temporary position.
Helping the order in the only way I still can—with tutoring and research.\n\nI will never recover the power I lost when my shadow died on that island. But mercifully, I've retained my wits and memories. To my great surprise, I'm an excellent teacher!
Then my sacrifice on Dranil Kir was vital and worthwhile. Had you not defeated Bonafryd and my shadow, you may never have reached the Clockwork City.\n\nTell me—what occurred in Sotha Sil's realm?
So, it's back into the bag I go, eh? Fair enough.\n\nJust try to make a little more room, all right? I like lumps of ore and rodent meat as much as the next trans-dimensional entity, but it gets ridiculous in there sometimes.
I mean, I'd just assumed since Naliara entrusted you with her notes you were taking over her duties. You don't want to uncover a once in a lifetime discovery?\n\nI have a generous stipend from the Illumination Academy to complete my work.
We study the skull as it relates to cognitive behavior—when we're not on holiday, that is.\n\nThis was to be my well-earned sabbatical from the College of Sapiarchs. Alas, this business with the vintner dashed any hopes for relaxation. Typical.
You have defeated many werewolves now, yes? But none like Mylenne Moon-Caller.\n\nShe speaks, and the pack listens. Of course, this is mainly because she kills all who dare disobey her. Within this keep, only Vykosa holds more power.
I'm afraid not. Vykosa's heart must still be fresh from the kill for this spell to work. We'd only have a few short moments after her death. \n\nBut we cannot delay what needs to be done. Vykosa must be defeated.
Yes. Narazda was among those the Archivist experimented on. The testing was supposed to strengthen her, to make her more … useful to the pack.\n\nAnd in a way, it did. It made her strong enough to resist Vykosa's compulsion.
And do you not? Yes, Narazda knows what you are.\n\nSurely, you too have felt the duality of our affliction. This power, it is both curse and blessing. It has given us strength, power, freedom. And hardship, of course. And pain.
This Great Hunt isn't going to be a Sundas stroll, that's all.\n\nI wouldn't waste my time getting friendly with the competition, if I were you. It's not like that tusking stag up there is going to care if we play dirty.
Do give me some credit. If I'm about to jump into a plane of Oblivion, research is the least I can do. Besides, Daedric studies was always my specialty within the tribe.
Well, information is my primary business, and business is good! Which reminds me, I never give anything away for free. Especially information.\n\nPerform a favor for me. Then I'll tell you what I know about Margus Derius.
The best kind, one that benefits us both!\n\nAllow me to mark a house on your map. Inside you'll find a crate that contains an elegant jacket. I'm something of a snappy dresser and I want that jacket. Bring it to me and I'll tell you all about Margus.
I prefer merchant to smuggler, but call me what you will. I transport rare and valuable antiquities—no questions asked. I'm also considered the most knowledgeable Argonian relics expert outside of Black Marsh. \n\nSo, how can I help you this day?
And I'm waiting for a wamasu egg. To be more specific, I'm waiting for one of the beautiful eggs from the nest I marked on your map.\n\nDo you have a wamasu egg for me hiding in your pack, perhaps?
The Psijic Order is an ancient society of mages, more akin to a monastic order than to the upstart Mages Guild, for example.\n\nWe once served as advisors to the rulers of Tamriel, before we departed the world to pursue other interests.
I only know that we were kept in the chambers beneath the twin xanmeers. If anyone is still alive, that's where they will be found.\n\nBe cautious, they will be guarded by those Shuxaltsei has enthralled. They overwhelmed us with ease.
All the more reason for me to run as far from this place as I possibly can. I know how powerful cursed Argonian relics can be!\n\nIf only I had enough gold for the voyage. My poor feet can only carry me so far, you know.
Confidence! Initiative! Excellent! These are wonderful traits that will almost certainly get you killed. Do not worry—Zadaza will ensure that your legend lives on by scooping up your bloody gear and selling it.\n\nAh, Famia arrives!
A haj mota snatched it out of my hands as I soaked my feet by the guloo bridge. Very quick. Gone in an instant. Such is life.\n\nI do not know why the haj mota would want such a thing, but the Hist must have thought it needed it. I hope it enjoys it.
Hmm. Ritual Argonian poetry. The words are common, but the meter is all wrong. There's more to it. Missing verses, perhaps? Truthfully, Kassandra is the authority on that sort of thing.\n\nYou should set out. I'll try to dig up a few relevant texts.
Yes, well … I had hoped to discuss that in private. Provided this little misadventure hasn't driven you from the business completely, I'd like to bring you on for another task.\n\nLet me settle up here, then I'll meet you in my office in Lilmoth.
Bah. You're no fun. Fine, here's your salt. Guess I'll go back to drinking alone.
No, not specifically. But even a hammer can be used for good or ill.\n\nMargus seeks one of the pre-Duskfall relics, I'm sure of it! I just need to figure out which one before something terrible occurs. With your help, we can avert a disaster.
Be sure to tell Jee-Lar, all right? If I know Black Marsh, he'll definitely need more before long. Farewell!
Just one of the most dangerous bands of outlaws to emerge from the swamps of Black Marsh! The group supposedly started years ago in Blackrose Prison.\n\nI'm not sure why Margus and the Blackguards are working together, but nothing good will come of it.
In this place, even the keenest eyes see little but embers of the truth, Rootmender. Here, we see with our souls. But these are questions for a dozing time. This moment demands action.\n\nYou seek the seed, correct?
I may be new to the Argonian antiquities trade, but Margus and his cronies know me all too well. They'd turn me away or stick a dagger in my back before the door closes behind me!\n\nI need someone without any ties to Cyrodilic Collections for this.
You want to know about Margus? Interesting. Very well. Perform a service and this one will tell you what you want to know.\n\nLocate my assistant and bring him back, or at least tell me if it is time to hire a new one. Good help is so hard to find.
Long years of bitter disappointment have trained me to measure my expectations. We will find something in the grove, I am certain of it. But this dream-wallow business ….\n\nThe Hist will not make this easy. Not for you, and certainly not for me.
Oh, certainly! Xukas enjoys friendly relationships with practically everyone—even the Nagas. \n\nSome of Lilmoth's investors see him as a bit of a swindler, but that's rooted in their ignorance of Argonian culture more than anything else.
I do not need to convince you? That is good, if a little disconcerting.\n\nLozwug shows loud, obnoxious interest in our game, teeba-enoo. Ask him to explain the rules. While he growls and rants, I will take the letter from his pocket. Simple, I think.
Really? I can't imagine that they'd be enthusiastic about helping us, but I suppose Xukas would know best.\n\nBefore you go, would you mind sharing what you've learned with someone else? Cyrodilic Collections' primary benefactor is just upstairs.
The ojel stands its ground? Brave. Or stupid.\n\nA flock of flat-toothed Blackguards took refuge in this ravine. They snatched up some of my egg-kin—your allies too—and threw them in cages. Now, Tsojei and I will hack these greels to pieces.
It will prove something. On that, we agree.\n\nVery well. Walk the Path. Kishi will accompany you as your mentor. Return with the sacred lily and I will listen to Kishi's plea. If you fail and die, Bhoki will be executed and our traditions will stand.
Deroh-Zah is an Argonian behemoth, created by our Hist to protect the sacred lily and test the mettle of our novice warriors.\n\nKnow that the creature has tasted the blood of many novices. He will not fall easily, I am sorry to say.
I nod my head. A fitting place. Good.\n\nI will meet you at the tree.
We have suitors from the Black-Tongues, the Root-House people and the Moss-Skin tribe.\n\nWhich tribe do you wish to know better?
I suppose I could take time from my actual duties to sate your mere curiosity. What more do you wish to know?
The Rose was built upon ruins, built upon ruins, built upon ruins. The Hist only knows what was buried beneath, but if anything was to stir Shuxaltsei from her grave, the bloodshed of the prison riots would be it.\n\nBut we have more dire concerns.
To mock me, I'm sure. After all, I lack both the knowledge and means to seek out the tablets myself.\n\nThe sooner you aid me in this, the better. I would rather suffer a thousand mire-gnats than the disapproving gaze of Nisswo Paraxeeh.
Xukas and I … we set our roots here. I cannot explain it in the dry-tongue. It is like the sun rising, or the rivers flowing downstream. It simply is.\n\nXukas and I watch over the tree because we must. You find the Remnant because you must.
Oh! So you're that adventurer she mentioned in her letters. What a welcome coincidence! Concordia has been invaluable to the effort. One day I'll finally convince her to visit.
From what I hear, Drakeeh's a pretty devoted follower of Sithis. He even claims that his power of necromancy stems from that worship. \n\nThrough the Dread-Father, he controls death and darkness and void! That sort of thing.
Oh, egg-kin, surely you are not so lost that you have forgotten your roots.\n\nAll Saxhleel serve a Hist—even those who stray beyond the borders. Their branches protect us and their sap sustains us. Visit Bright-Throat Village sometime. You will see.
Do you wish to ride on your father's back in swaddle-skins all your life? This is the chukka-sei, Mateem. The naming day! If you wish to have a say in the tribe's affairs, you must prove your worth.
Have you not fought the beasts, already? Ayleids. Elves with hearts like flint.\n\nOur strongest kaals and their shellback elites held the ojels at bay for weeks, but a pack of them broke through the line—attacking the village.
Yes. But at great cost. For every Saxhleel lost, five Ayleids lie dead. We … I must believe we broke them here. As soon as the sap-speaker gives us her blessing, I will rally the others for a counter-attack.\n\nWe will end this, Mateem. Today.
The narrow reed you call real cannot hold the Hist's truth, Rootmender. Real. Illusion. Dream. Waking. These are the words that keep our bellies to the mud. We are safe there, yes. But we cannot see very far.\n\nToday, you see very far indeed.
Each tablet represents a month in the year's cycle. Vakka, Xeech, Sisei, and so on. As with the dryskin calendar, there are twelve months in total.\n\nWithout these tablets, the Xinchei-Konu is powerless.
Many think of death as an end. This is only partially correct. \n\nDeath is also a beginning, a cycle turned again. The Shadowscales see this more clearly than most, and so we are tasked with sharing our wisdom with others. Sometimes quite suddenly.
My egg-sire resigned his position after the unfortunate events surrounding the rite of passage some seven seasons ago.\n\nOne of Bhoki's students, a young Naga named Chukala, considered himself to be better than the others. Better than his training.
What? Rub oil into my scales? Whatever for?
Oh? So you finally caught wind of the truth, did you?\n\nNurhei's the whole reason I'm like this, you know. Gave me my first bottle of skooma, free of charge! The bottles afterward, of course, were plenty costly.
Like a battle cry, I lead. Like a lullaby, I soothe. Like a funeral dirge, I mourn. My song guides the souls of our departed back to the loving embrace of the Hist.\n\nIt is also I who ensures the burial rites of my tribe.
Oh, I—ah—don't wish to speak ill of anyone of the tribe. I only hear idle gossip from time to time. I'm told Keenam has the bad habit of speaking his mind too freely and listening poorly, but I have never heard complaint of his egg-tending.
Well, it has many uses, but we mostly grow it for potions to aid in fruitful bonding. Our ancestors believed chewing the leaves helps the body prepare healthy eggs. Nobody really does that anymore.
The ruins serve as a perfect killing field. Which is what will happen to Kishi if you continue to stand here and ask me questions.\n\nIf you really want to help, save my egg-son and then tell him to leave the village and never return.
Yes. Why would I not be?\n\nThings are not so simple here, beeko. Naga warriors kill, and kidnap, and steal, yes—but we are all children of the root. If the Hist wills it, Jaxsik might even kill me eventually. But she will still be my friend.
The markings resemble Ta'agra, but I can't read it—perhaps some lost Khajiiti dialect. The writing seems out of place, like it was added later. The imagery looks much older, but it's a style I've never seen before.\n\nWhat value was this to Dwemer?
I'll limp as quick as I can, Rootmender.
Sun-blessed toads. They nest in mud pits, emerging every few seasons to mate. To lure them out, make a musk out of stench sedge, salt rush, and joymallow. Find a pit that has a croak-wheel and pour the musk on yourself. Then just turn the wheel!
Of course. To prepare for the renewal rite, the ux, one must align their three primal essences—blood, bile, and mind. This will make them open to the ritual and bind them to the renewal charm.\n\nOnly then will they be ready to proceed.
To align one's bile is to engage and strengthen one's constitution. What better way then by drinking the venom of a poisonous snake and surviving the experience?\n\nFind a den of vipers in the swamp and consume a cupful of their venom.
I work with our participants for many risings of the sun to help them align their minds for the ritual, but there is a faster way. \n\nStand beneath a raging waterfall and let the sound clear all thoughts from your mind.
Oh, goodness no! That wouldn't be proper. I need to maintain my objectivity. For my readers, you understand.\n\nStibbons will prepare himself, attend the ritual, and tell me all about it. Then I will recount it in my book with scholarly detachment.
I served as the tribe's war-teacher before I was replaced. That old book contains my training methods—techniques that worked well until they didn't. When Mewah-Jez changed everything, novices started to die.\n\nBut tell me, why do you care?
Sithis is a being of multitude. It is the will of change, the force of chaos, the lust for bloodshed. Its words are many, and so the nisswo are many.\n\nBut we all speak parts of the larger truth.
Out in the marsh, I'm afraid. I sent a few of my best people to gather the stones for me and agreed to meet them later. With your help, it shouldn't take long.\n\nCan I count on you to accompany me?
Well, I'm not letting him out of my sight the next time he passes through, if it's all the same to you.
Of course! Outsiders respond better to people they see as important.\n\nWe're partners. Equals in this endeavor. Serving as my envoy is for appearances only. It makes us both look good and improves our chances to secure a deal with the Captain.
I made this for her. She would never let it fall from her wrist. She … she really is gone.\n\nPlease, leave me. Help the others. I need to be alone.
Bee-ears! I do not know how the Nords make brew from such things, but I like it! I should have Vetra-Jat ask her guest about getting more. Perhaps she will accept weevil eyes in trade?
The whole tribe is filled with nothing but thieves. I can't believe they even get away with it! The other villages should have put a stop to them long ago.\n\nAnd now here I am, an innocent traveler getting robbed blind!
Exactly! Do you know how many relics I had to sell to earn that gold? How many xanmeers I had to scour, how many traps I had to dodge?\n\nBy all rights, that coin purse is mine! I refuse to be intimidated like this!
I am well. The Bright-Throat tribe has been very welcoming to this old traveler. Of course, I try to help when I can with my healing skills.\n\nAh, but I talk too much. I'm sure you have many others to greet.
How was I—what do you mean, how was I swindled? I already told you.\n\nI'm expected to pay for bug filled linens and treks through the swamp? I was told that I would be exposed to the beauty and mysteries of Murkmire! And that was not delivered.
Well, the basics of the game are, yes. But without knowing all the rules, one can never hope to truly succeed in playing such a sport.\n\nWhy the Wood Elf even wants to play, I do not know.
I see. Yes, that sounds about right!
An apprentice. I cannot dishonor Nisswo Kahei's wishes, but how can I one day spread the word of Sithis if some hackwing eats us?\n\nHowever … she has not forbidden you from lighting the fire.
Same as always, thanks to you. Baar Dau hangs peacefully above the city, Lord Vivec writes and sings in his palace, and our new archcanon has adapted well to his responsibilities.\n\nIn fact, things are so quiet that we decided to take this trip.
Because the Blackguard founders were former Naga inmates. This was decades ago, of course. I'm sure all the original members have died off by now.\n\nDrakeeh the Unchained leads them now. He accepts everyone.
Very good! There's a fair wind, now. Should be a pleasant sail.
All children of Sithis are welcome in Murkmire, you just might find yourself in the Dread Father's embrace sooner than you like if you track mud through his house.
A temple? Oh no, no, no. A temple implies worship. Argonians worship the Hist, and venerate Sithis. Beyond that, I've never found any substantial variety in their religious habits.\n\nThis would be some kind of, I don't know … garden?
I think they're right. Aside from the word of the Hist—which I've learned is very persuasive—legends say that the Vakka-Bok xanmeer holds a great treasure. It has to be the Remnant!\n\nNow, we should get moving. We've got to stop Kassandra!
In lean times, they gather in the ruins to the west, along with their leader, Rahti. You destroyed their smaller encampments, so they must be there.\n\nMost of the walls collapsed centuries ago, but the ones that still stand are mountain-strong.
Hakoshae was built after the fall of the Akaviri Potentate. It's been, let's see now … a little over a hundred years now? Yes, right around that.\n\nThe town was founded by the Akaviri refugees who fled during that time.
Though Hakoshae is known for its Akaviri ancestry, the truth is that our Imperial bloodline runs far richer. Still, we honor our Akaviri ancestors by maintaining some of their customs.\n\nThe Proving Festival is a shining example of that.
Most assuredly. Unless the Euraxians blunder into them first, but I do not think we can count on that. They figured out how to turn the gas against us, after all.\n\nFirst things first, however. We need to find a way to open that door.
Most impressive. I'd say you've certainly made your ancestors proud!\n\nGood thing, too. Wouldn't want any unhappy spirits mucking about Hakoshae. They'd bring all sorts of misfortune.
Hrrm. That does not bode well. The Betrayer of Khunzar-ri was a great hero who became a terrible villain. It took all the remaining champions and the Moon-Priests of Anequina to stop him.\n\nBut how does the Betrayer's return help the Dragons?
We need a key, and I'm positive the captain of the guard carries one. If you would do me the kindness of chatting him up for a bit, I'll do my best to obtain the key.\n\nShould all go well, we'll be in and out before anyone notices.
Hmm, well, funny story.
Khasda, the dung-eater that runs the Stitches, has a hoard of gold beneath Meirvale keep. Tasnasi plans to make it hers. Ours.\n\nIf you're interested, we need to move soon. The Stitches gets worse by the day. Khasda may leave, and his coin with him.
As often said by Pollu the Overstating: "this is worthy of celebration!" \n\nYou have done this one a great turn. In the dark days the Stitches find themselves in, it is good to hold a memory of brighter times.
Thank you, thank you! May Bright Moons light your path!\n\nIshu will prepare a feast for Zinthia's return, yes? Perhaps some fish? Ah, yes, fish is her favorite. This one can already hear her contented purrs!
Zahari has heard tell of Daedra gathering near ancient sites such as the Brothers of Strife, Torinaan, and the Moonlit Maw.\n\nOf course, any Daedric soul will suffice.
Stonefalls. \n\nLong ago, the Dark Elves built very large statues to honor two of their generals. Search south of the city of Ebonheart. The statues are difficult to miss.
Torinaan is a set of Ayleid ruins in the High Elf province of Auridon, located southeast of Firsthold and northwest from Skywatch. \n\nMany scamps have been seen there, most likely summoned by a rogue mage.
No, a different kind of demon. Now be quiet and listen!\n\n"The demon said, "My brothers and I shall take this land and its treasures. Even the moons from the sky!" Khunzar-ri objected, but the demon laughed. "You cannot stop us, little cat-thing!"
I am having many thoughts, but I know what I must do. Like Anequina and my other ancestors before me, I must stand tall and accept my responsibilities with humility and grace.\n\nProvided the Mane's envoy confirms my right to the throne.
Vazbi does not think so. Before the water reaches S'rendarr's Cradle, it passes Rimmen. And for all the city's problems, a drought is not one of them. That means the flow is blocked somewhere between the city and the adeptorium.
No. Zamarak was guarding Khamira that day. We were far from the palace.\n\nAnyway, this one learned that the local crime lord provided Saulinia with guides who know the Scar well. We must hurry if we hope to catch them.
As a member of the Morag Tong, my grandfather executed a great number of people. But given the location, and the armor the spirit wears …. \n\nLet's move ahead. I have a feeling we'll get our answers soon enough.
Zamarak thought the soldiers circled around the town to attack from an unexpected direction. That is most certainly true, but they are also digging. They do seem to be looking for something.\n\nStrange things occur since this one returned from exile.
Of course. But, first and foremost, it is Mizzik's passion.\n\nThat is why this one takes the name Thunderboots. If he cannot work in the name of justice? Then he will not work at all. This, he swears.
You killed a Dragon? Ha! Oh, walker, that is just—. Wait, are you serious?\n\nJone and Jode! Seems Numaia hired the right stranger, yes? Those poachers do not stand a chance!
What would you have done? The lives of everyone in the adeptorium were at stake! Should Silhu-jo have chosen for all to die instead? Would that have been better?
I am Queen Euraxia's chief necromancer. You may call me Zumog Phoom. The other gravecallers answer to me.\n\nAnd this is my familiar and confidant, Sir Cadwell the Betrayer.
Vazbi left S'rendarr's Cradle, as she said she would. Remember?\n\nThis one knew life would be hard outside the adeptorium. She knows no one, you see. And with so much trouble in the land, there are few to help Vazbi along.
We will wait until you have blown the Dragonhorn. If the Dragon is subdued, that will be our best chance to escape. If not, well, we will try to be swift.
Queen Ayrenn insisted that Raz take a vacation after his last mission. "Even the Eye of the Queen needs to blink now and then," she told him.\n\nSo Raz returned to Elsweyr to spend some quality time with his family.
Ah, the lovely land of Gold Coast. And the equally lovely Naryu.\n\nIf only more assassins had her particular assets. Raz's job would certainly be a lot more interesting. More difficult, yes, but far more interesting.
We are not many, but we are strong. The adepts of the Desert Wind will aid the city.\n\nZamarak will see you there, after he makes sure the Grand Adept receives the proper blessings.
Then I must ask you to find them. My sisters are not fighters. They will need your protection far more than I.\n\nFor now, I'll make my way back to my father.
<You are about to enter a Group Dungeon. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
The lowest. Khasda clawed his way to the top of the Stitches with treachery and fear. The Stitches hasn't known law, but under Dashing Dasalzo it knew relative peace. Common purpose. Now it falls into anarchy. Khasda won't stop it—he creates it.
Yep. Some scavenged Dwarven artifacts, cobbled together to make a lock that most saps couldn't crack. Khasda probably bought them off Jubani. And Jubani probably had them built by a particularly handsome and talented Bosmer.\n\nThat's me, by the way.
Tasnasi's route involves us crossing the courtyard. The safest way to cross it without being seen? Don't cross it.\n\nSo I'm going to teleport us. Which is something I can absolutely do.
I feel tip-top, I must say. I thought it was the cozy confines of my beloved Coldharbour, but I suppose it has more to do with the destruction of my other half.\n\nWell, good show! The world is saved!
I'm afraid not. Least, not from here. He did something to the apparatus. It can't be used again. Khamira might be able to separate the moons, but she'd need to do it at the Moon Gate.\n\nShe looks a little peaked, though, doesn't she?
Yes. This one knows. Silhu-jo has prayed on this for eighteen years. He still hears the ghosts of the sick cough and wail every time he goes to sleep. But if we had let them stay, many more would have died. I had no choice.\n\nCome. Vazbi waits.
Silhu-jo understands. It can be difficult, to know what to do in such a position. But this one cannot say what he did was wrong. As loathsome as it was, as cruel … it was not wrong. I only hope my child will understand.\n\nNow, come. Vazbi waits.
In case you haven't noticed, we two don't always see eye to eye. She can be impetuous and obstinate, truth be told.\n\nKhamira gathered a handful of soldiers and took off to the west. If you run into her, send her back to Riverhold.
A powerful and insidious spell, to turn the whole temple on its head! But at least a spell may be broken. It's a small comfort to hope that their minds may not be truly lost.
Souls contain tremendous power, but they place certain checks on mortal will. Divesting the two—soul and mortal form—removes these boundaries. The effect is a virtually limitless magical horizon.\n\nThe process extracts a heavy toll, of course.
A few.\n\nWe should get back to the task at hand.
Haduras does not smell the sick sweetness of the drug upon them. Terrible as it is, the fleeting skooma-dreams would be preferable to this all-consuming madness.\n\nOn this side of the Lattice, it seems Sheggorath needs no sugar to share his lunacy.
Good. I just need to check on the town's defenses before we rendezvous with Gharesh-ri.
A merchant hired us to escort his wagon into Orcrest.\n\nWhen the flu broke out and the fires started, he panicked and got himself killed. We hid in a room and used his supplies to survive, but that's no way to live. Besides, these two talk too much.
Yeah. This one's too slick and clever to swing claws and swords around. Leave that to the Pahmar-raht and the Senches, right?\n\nIn times of war, the wise stand in the back and throw heavy things. Good motto to live by, yes?
Of course not. It's obvious now that the poor dear can't handle his rotmeth. I just wish he'd said something sooner.\n\nBut hey, if you're looking for a bit of extra gold? I could always use a new taster!
Useless shaveskin! We'll never catch him now!\n\nListen well, clawless. If the guards ask about Ak'an or Eljhan, you will say nothing. Breathe one word of this, and the wrath of Tu'heiba will find you. Eljhan! We go!
You destroyed one, yes, and the shade simply taunted us. There must be others.\n\nIf we're to have any hope of stopping this lich, we'll have to find and destroy all of them. A daunting prospect. They're probably well-hidden.
Naturally. Jakarn's bosom friend does not see where Jakarn goes. Bah! You outsiders are worse than the Knahaten flu!\n\nWe will find your cheating friend eventually, dung-walker. Count on it.
What's the matter? The giant spike trap under Fez'skar's feet! It could impale Fez at any moment!
The Cygnus Irregulars are on probation. For now. Once Queen Khamira sees us in action, I'm sure she'll come around.\n\nUntil then, I wanted to make sure you were all right. Beating Saulinia is no small feat! I'm sorry we lost the Dragonguard, though.
Hmph. Only the very crude would call it necromancy.\n\nYes, we reanimated the skeletons of fallen Khajiit, but always as a path to redemption. The dro-m'Athra who possessed those bones did so to earn their way back to paradise.
Why do we not aid more dro-m'Athra? Why fear Namiira if we bear Azurah's blade? Why do we fear at all?\n\nMy answers never satisfied him. He was fiercely loyal to Azurah, but resentful, too. Impatient. And powerful enough to doubt our warnings.
An adeptorium. Zamarak stayed there after he returned to Anequina. It was attacked by a Dragon.\n\nOne of the old treasures of Star Haven was a Dragonhorn. When sounded, the Dragon cried in pain. The horn faded to dust after it was used.
Our troubles began with the Knahaten Flu. It swept through Orcrest like a flood, leaving death in its wake. The tide of dead rolled in until our vaults were full and those who survived begged us to spare them. We took pity and agreed.
So your memory isn't totally addled? Yes, but we discovered that the Khajiit had more to deal with than just the Dragons.\n\nMy half-sister, Euraxia, the Usurper Queen of Rimmen, has aligned with the great beasts and necromancers to conquer Elsweyr.
Just that Cadwell, the gallant knight of Coldharbour, seems to be involved. Well, his physical remains, anyway. Zumog Phoom seeks Cadwell the Betrayer's severed body parts in order to restore the evil knight.\n\nTo what end? I have no idea.
Thank you, friend. Thadarra had doubts about accepting a strange package that smells like curdled dog slobber, but it felt like the right thing to do.\n\nPlease visit again if you'd like Thadarra to help with your embarrassing sense of style.
I saw Asaldak, the famous Khajiit sweetmaker, by the Merryvale Farms fountain!\n\nAsk him to try my sweetbread. His endorsement will change the Khajiiti belief that Nords only eat frozen potatoes and inspire a pastry-based esteem between our cultures.
Yes! The wandering litter of Baan Dar—father of bandits and exiles.\n\nMany Khajiit find comfort in towns and cities, but not us. We love to travel, you see? As my mother says, a house without wheels is just a very expensive coffin.
All the Divines have a vital role to play, but you could say Alkosh's is the most important. Without him, time would not flow like a river that we mortals can sail, but sit lifeless or churn like a boiling pot. He keeps us from chaos and stagnation.
He spends most of his time in the chancel, to what end I do not know. The false god has little interest in us, but he makes sure we don't forget him. He has two other Dragons keeping watch over us to ensure our obedience.
More deceit. The faithful of Alkosh would only raise their claws to enemies of the Khajiit. The Dragon King of Cats saw through your bad intentions. Khajiit may not stop you, but you will not cross the little lattice to profane his chancel!
This one still licks the wounds from his beatings, but perhaps he can forgive the ones deceived. You clawed out the cruel among them with the Dragons.\n\nPerhaps this place can become a true temple of Alkosh again.
The temple still stands and the evil cast out. This one will offer penance and prayers to Alkosh for his foolishness. With the Great Cat's blessing, Azin-jo will reconsecrate this place in his name and work to restore its glory. As he always has.
It would be an undeserved blessing to have his prayers answered, but if Khajiit wish to use this temple once again, Azin-jo will be grateful.\n\nThis one will do his best to see the people's faith restored.
This one only knows what he was told. Alkosh told him to spread word of his return and to bring him faithful servants, so that is what Azin-jo did. He did not question why Alkosh wanted these things or spoke to the wound in the sky.
Excellent. Let's be on our way, then.
You make a fair point. Sanzagh is hungry, but not hungry enough to spend the next three weeks picking scales from his teeth.\n\nSanzagh will find something else to eat.
The ones who are closest to Khasda do not show loyalty because they are virtuous, but because he allows them to indulge their worst impulses.\n\nI am not telling you to punish them, only that they won't be missed by anyone in the Stitches.
The ancient texts tell us that when we pass on, we rejoin our mother, Azurah. She awaits us on the other side of the Crossing, and welcomes us home with open arms.\n\nIn joining Azurah, we also rejoin the ja-Kha'jay.
Cheese on toast? That's just crazy talk. Next you'll be trying to make toast with the cheese already on it!\n\nOff with your cheese and toast madness. Looney.
If it were permitted, it wouldn't be theft. But just because it's illegal doesn't make it unworthy of veneration. Do you not cheer the gladiator because the law says not to strike another?\n\nAlas, no arena celebrates the clever thief.
Seeing now that the thief was one of her chosen people, the Prince, Azurah, stayed Mafala's hand.\n\n"By your admission this one knows the night better than any other. Who better to decide, or do you fear the truth will be too ugly?"
He slipped past me and flagged down a guard on the way out. Would have landed me in jail if that guard hadn't been the same one I bribed to get on the ship.\n\nThe guard arrested Fez instead, and we split his loot. Still, I had to respect the effort.
You mean other than getting drunk enough to forget a magic gem made my friend jump off a cliff?\n\nHaven't decided. Might be time for another job. Taking something that doesn't belong to me always cheers me up.
Yushiha promised to guide us. Odd to put our trust in vampires, but odder still to owe them our lives. The light of the Moons travels strange paths.\n\nKhajiit do not know your reasons for sparing us, but we are grateful for your mercy.
Just what you would expect. We held our ground against the swarming Euraxians and their necromancers. Repelled the Dragons as best we could.\n\nThis one let the Desert Wind flow through his limbs and claws while our soldiers rallied to his side.
It's all in my report. Our troops held their ground and fought bravely. We lost many good soldiers, Khajiiti and Imperial, but we did our duty.\n\nWe slaughtered Euraxians by the score and kept the Dragons at bay until the moons broke apart.
If that's what they need. But the Cygnus Irregulars are mostly military engineers, scouts, and trainers. We have a lot more to offer a kingdom that needs to be rebuilt than just blades and shields.\n\nThat was our original mission. To help Elsweyr.
I want you to know I appreciate everything you have done for Elsweyr … for me. I do not believe we would have survived without your assistance.\n\nNow, I understand the envoy asked you to stand beside me at the ceremony. Are you ready, my friend?
Next? Haven't given it a thought! It's enough trouble keeping track of the past and present to bother with what happens in the future.\n\nMaybe I'll finally build that little house on the edge of Coldharbour's yawning Chasm. Ah, the vertigo!
Oh, you know. A bit of derring-do, a righteous quest, and a quick jaunt around Oblivion and the known planes of existence. All very exciting!\n\nNever found a place quite as lovely as Coldharbour, but what place could be?
Ha! Surely you've been in the adventuring business long enough to know that looks can be deceiving.\n\nI don't understand her precise nature. Not yet, anyway. But she's flush with spiritual power. Don't take her for granted.
The siege weapons aimed down into the city. We need to disable them before Euraxia realizes she's under attack or she'll destroy Rimmen just to spite us.\n\nMeet Nala-do and destroy two of the installations. Khamira will take care of the third.
The King's Claws were an elite squad of agents loyal to King Hemakar of Rimmen. They protected the king and the royal family, undertook special missions … all very hush-hush.\n\nIt's a guess, but if I'm right it explains much about Zamarak.
That's another of those blank spaces in my memory. I have no idea why the vile person I used to be would commit such a dastardly deed. You know, once we find my head, we need to ask it about that.\n\nRight before we toss it into a roaring fire.
Worried? No, that would imply I had any feelings toward the man whatsoever.\n\nI'd say I'm more concerned that his nonchalant attitude toward his sister's death might be hiding his true emotions. I trust that he's here to help, but he's still a Tharn.
I expect nothing but your continued assistance, Vestige. However, I concede that your aid in recovering the relic was vital, so I assure you that it is perfectly safe.\n\nSafer than it has ever been.
Hmm. Some folk mentioned seeing old banners fluttering in the breeze up on the hill. Trophies from old conquests, or something more, perhaps? You can tell me when you return, eh?
Of course! What would you like to know?
Keeping the peace among this rogues gallery is no easy thing. Some days Tasnasi almost misses the quiet solitude of exile, but every day she sees the Stitches get a little closer to Dasalzo's dream of a safe haven for those who would live free.
One problem solved, then. The next is sheer age. This ancient combat horn is exceedingly fragile. I'm not sure how many times we can sound the horn before it disintegrates into dust.\n\nFor that reason, I suggest we save it until we absolutely need it.
It is my home and heart, where I have had the privilege of training many fine blademasters.\n\nMy most accomplished student will meet us there. We can give him the maps to both sanctuaries and let him decide on the next course of action.
He may. Even without the Clan Mother goading him, Grundwulf will back his conviction with his blade. If it comes to that, I'll put him in his place. I'd rather wound his pride than witness his self-destruction.
I think the land at the bottom represents this island, Dragonhold. See the vast amounts of aeonstone, including the spire at the center? Its energy feeds into the new moon as it rises into the night sky.
A long way to go, but such a relic is what Sai was hoping to find when he set forth upon this path.\n\nMay Leki watch over you, warrior. You and Sai both.
You found the Dragonhorn? By Leki's perfect blade, that is good news. \n\nThank you, warrior. You did far more than help Sai Sahan recover the wisdom of the Dragonguard. Because of your efforts, he finally has a way to combat this Dragon invasion.
She was being rather cryptic, but I think she wants to throw a celebration. Honor the Dragonguard and all that.\n\nBeforehand, however, she wants to talk to you. You can find her in Senchal Palace.
Kazahn may know more. He is a ruffian, but Lahini loves him. She would have at least told him goodbye.\n\nBut he refuses to speak to Buzinda. All he does is sit in the tavern, drinking his days away.
He loiters around the city's outskirts, along with his first mate, Caska. Just look for a Dagi-raht and a Senche-raht arguing with each other. You can't miss them.\n\nOh, and tell them Aeliah sent you!
There's no need to fight the noble Dragons who wish to rule over us. Swear your loyalty to them and no harm will befall you.\n\nJoin the Order of the New Moon and your survival is guaranteed.
That entrance has most likely been sealed in response to what you and she accomplished here.\n\nA structure as ancient as this must have other entrances, though. Let's find one and make our way to the amphitheater.
I remember closing my eyes as death embraced me … and then opening them to see the sun rising over the Dragontail Mountains. Beyond that, it's all a blank slate.\n\nBelieve me, Vestige, I would not keep such a secret from you.
And Nahfahlaar believes this aeonstone can enhance that energy as well.\n\nBy Leki's Blade, this looks grim. A sizable Dragon cult that's able to directly empower their Dragon gods.
Oh, fine. Selene's got her hands full with healing the damage Maarselok caused. It's keeping her out of trouble. She's steering clear of our people in the area. Not that I can blame her. I just hope Carindon hasn't destroyed her trust completely.
Then this shrine must be to honor her. How could it not?\n\nWhen Blademaster Sai returned to us, he was broken. Empty. And I can't help but wonder if his desire to fight Dragons, to save Elsweyr, if that stems from a need to … forget her.
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We need to find Nahfahlaar, first and foremost.\n\nAccording to this inscription, the mask can somehow be used to light fires. We should search for unlit torches or braziers.
The outlying towns have already been ravaged by Dragons, and refugees have come pouring into Senchal as a result. They hope that stone walls will stop the Dragons' wrath.\n\nBut it's only a matter of time before the Dragons attack Senchal.
Why else would it roost so close to the city?\n\nI believe the Dragon is evaluating Senchal's defenses and preparing for the right moment to strike. We must slay it before it gets that chance.
You'd be surprised what people tell a respectable gentleman with a distinguished beard.\n\nTake <<1>>, for example. I heard that she's been seeking a way to leave Senchal for weeks. A few gems would certainly help pay for her passage.
I will join with you and empower the mask. You are a worthy ally and a champion of my father's will. Only together can we hope to defeat Laatvulon.\n\nRaise the mask before me. It is time.
A brazier stands before each. Perhaps if we were to light them, they would reveal a way forward. Though I also suspect there's a proper order to it all.\n\nRead each statue's plaque and see if they contain any clues.
That's one reason. Another is that studying her allows me to make great strides in the advancement of civilization. Her essence alone … ah, you're implying that I'm a hypocrite.\n\nSpare me your judgement.
Only that it affects the flora and fauna alike, poisoning and twisting them. If they're lucky they die. I'm hoping Selene can fight back against the blight, otherwise we might not even make it to Maarselok at all.
It wasn't his hideout then, but yes. Well, no. Za'ji knows where he left it, though!\n\nCome, walker! Za'ji has a lock box hidden nearby.
If it was a zoo, why so secretive?\n\nI only know that Selloe or others are down here regularly enough, always looking for interesting creatures. And maybe those creatures include people like me and you.
'Course he is. Ugh. Always with the sneaking around. \n\nAll right, fine. Let's deliver the token. I'll keep Auberic distracted before I hand it over. You sneak around his house and see what you can learn about this little event they're planning.
Very much so. There is no one else I trust to handle such a delicate negotiation.\n\nGeneral Renmus has an idea this is coming. I want you to officially present the offer and determine what he thinks.
Nahfahlaar returned shortly after we did, but he's been acting strangely. He won't talk to me. Won't tell me what happened on the island after Tharn ….\n\nNahfahlaar trusts you. Can you speak to him for me?
Before I made my way to Elsweyr, I searched Dragonguard sanctuaries for weapons and wisdom. There I learned about the Horn of Ja'darri and how it was stolen by the Dragon Vahlokzin.\n\nI found Vahlokzin's lair, slew the beast, and took back the horn.
If you seek weaknesses, prepare for disappointment. I have none.\n\nWhile my brothers were slain or locked away, I have been free. I know when to fight, when to fly, when to look for allies. And so I stand before you, nikrent. Unbroken.
We pray to Khenarthi to share her knowledge, for all of Tamriel feels the caress of her winds.\n\nWe train to hear her words in the ringing of our sacred bells. Through them, we can find that which is lost. So you must get Za'ji to return the bell.
Turo does not respond well to bad news. The people who deliver it … more often than not, it is the last message they ever deliver.\n\nHe will come for us soon after. We must move quicker.
The citadel. You don't see grand Imperial edifices like this outside of Cyrodiil very often.\n\nPerhaps we can reclaim it. If we manage to rid it of undead, we might rebuild—learn its history. That would make my parents proud. I know it.
I think they'll take gold for any cause that'll pay them, and this clan don't need much encouragement to pick a fight. Dragonguard's got enough problems dealing with actual Dragons. Don't need more toadies getting in the way, too.
Not as sorry as the Dragons will be, walker.\n\nChizbari studied them from a distance for many long days and nights. Now this one knows their habits—their weaknesses. Some see them as gods. This one sees only quarry.
Information, obviously. It isn't every day an island flies up into the sky. I wanted\nto find out what the Dragonguard knew about it.\n\nMy daughter provided more than I bargained for, what with the details concerning a mad Dragon's plans for godhood.
The Shields will do as they have always done—keep Senchal safe and make sure its people come to no harm.\n\nI wish I believed this threat were confined to Senchal or even Southern Elsweyr, but I fear the danger extends beyond our borders.
And the boob! Don't forget the incompetent boob!\n\nThese candles, if effective, will save countless lives. A worthy endeavor, I'd say!
Percius and Bebbia had been discussing just that very thing. He has a great talent and a new found passion for restorations. This one intends to hire him to share his learnings with Khajiit. Perhaps more things thought lost may be returned to us.
Corner the market and make a killing. Had you, didn't I? Bebbia has already proposed an arrangement where I would teach what I've learned to Khajiit weavers. Restoring Khajiit of the Moons will be the first rebirth in the resurrection of a lost art!
Gossip and hearsay. As if any operative of the Morag Tong would do such a thing. \n\nSee, this is why the work of scholars is so important. Finding the truth, suppressing nonsensical rumors. Now then, I should get back to my notes.
Then it would be best for Caska and Za'ji to meet up with them and give a full report!\n\nYou go on ahead, walker. See if you can rendezvous with Nahfahlaar. We'll be right behind you.
Once, Anequina danced and the Moons moved … strangely. Like some great thing pulled the stars and Moons from their paths. \n\nKhunzar-ri suddenly fell, for where there used to be ground, now there was none. He could not stop himself from falling.
That's thanks to the General and the Shields. Good old Imperial structure, elbow grease, and organization. The Khajiit merchants provide a governing body, but the Shields of Senchal are the muscle behind it. Makes it all run.
Look for a notice around here to set you on your way, but the short version is that if your steel or your spells are mighty enough, travel to Elsweyr and slay Dragons on behalf of the Khajiit!
Nothing short of world domination. If he succeeds, Dragons will rule over Tamriel once more.\n\nHow precisely he plans to do this, we're not sure. But he has killed many, including his own kind, in order to make that desire a reality.
Thank Khenarthi. He feared the Darkness swallowed him before he could.\n\nHe heard his father calling him. He had to go. To see him. There was a great crack of a bell and he was gone. Is his father …?
Twisted as it is, Vijari knows there is love in his father's heart. This one prays the Divines will show mercy and wrench it right-ways some day.
Someone on this ship has to be. If everyone plans for sunny weather, how will we survive a storm?\n\nDespite the odds, it's not hopeless, though. If we can fight, then there's always a chance we can win.
You compare the sands of the hourglass to the moments which pass through time. Can they truly be the same? But then, are they truly so different?\n\nIt is one answer only the Dragon King knows.
You are an expert? All right, then!\n\nThere's a grapple point on the edge of some nearby scaffolding. Aim for that and let the bow do the rest of the work.
Tell her the truth. Her father wanted to save everyone despite the risks. I wanted to keep her safe.\n\nJano and I both made mistakes. Pride and stubbornness. Cowardice and heartache …. But now we can make things right. We can find peace.
Lady Bebbia has graciously extended her hospitality. I would be a fool to refuse such an illustrious invitation.\n\nI've asked an associate to mind my business in Abah's Landing in the mean time. He's the only one I could trust to handle it.
He was isolated from the rest of us. He learned secrets from the Clan Mother that no one else learned. Trained to become a warrior.\n\nAs a cub, this one was often jealous. But now Nuziwa sees that such a life was not a blessing, but a burden.
You have certainly proved yourself worthy of the Mask of Alkosh.\n\nJust do not expect it to ensure all your victories. Its power was only awakened through our connection. With my departure, it shall be but a mask.
Ah. Then you know how their temple fell to ruin and their order wiped out? The dro-m'Athra are insidious. Their very presence is enough to bring out Khajiit's inner darkness. To save one imperils many. The risk is too great.\n\nWe can only banish them.
I swear I intend you no harm. If I don't get that flask back, however, my intentions won't matter.\n\nRetrieve it and we'll break out of here together.
Sacred oil? Strange. That's the second time today someone has come seeking Arkay's anointing balm.\n\nSwordthane Uthlet arrived with an edict from the king. Demanded our entire supply! How we're to consecrate the dead without it, I have no idea.
Not immediately.\n\nOne by one, they fell to the flu. The spell proved too weak to protect their flesh, but too strong to let it pass. Now their souls and corpses remain. Tortured.
She had doubts, certainly. We all did. But at a certain point, it seems she lost faith in the ritual completely.\n\nI was furious. At first. I even called for her to be arrested on charges of desertion. Or would have, had I sent that letter.
During my explorations of Blackreach, I came across an ancient burial site. A place called the Midnight Barrow. This Undergrove must be inside those ruins.\n\nOnce there, you and Svana keep watch from a safe distance while Lyris steps into the storm.
Two things I wholeheartedly approve of. I carved a path through a number of witches and vampires, myself. Shor's bones, there are a lot of these bastards!\n\nAnything else to report?
Is this what would have happened to all of us if I hadn't gotten the others into the cave? I tried to heal Eivina, but Meridia's light had no effect.\n\nBut what was that about Priest Direnna and the stables?
Disappointing, but not unexpected. Reach witches are a tricky lot. Still, you have my thanks.\n\nIn the meantime, Hjaalmarch shall prepare for war. We may not have a defense against the harrowstorms, but we can be ready to attack once we have a target.
Such terrible things we witnessed today. An unnatural storm … vampires … innocent people turning into monsters … I fear this corruption cannot simply be prayed away.\n\nIt seems that Meridia has abandoned us to our fate. Why, I cannot say.
Reachmen transgressions will not be enough for Svargrim to accept outside help. He's a prideful man and the bad blood between him and Jorunn runs deep.\n\nI will speak on your behalf, but you and Lyris will need to bring me proof he cannot ignore.
Damn. Lucky thing he found you. Brondold was supposed to get the lay of the land before I got here. Without his information, my work for Jorunn the Skald-King could be over before it begins.\n\nWhat did he give you? Hand it over.
Dead? That's a new one. Nothing Kasalla usually moves through port is worth killing over. You didn't hear it from me, but she's the one picking up those shipments.\n\nHer warehouse is down on the docks. You want to know more, go ask her.
My sisters whisper prophecy to me from their stone circles of power. The Gray Host will rise and unite the Reach clans. Together, we will retake our home.\n\nI will lead them in this dark mission. I shall be made queen.
A plot against the high king? Involving plundered antiquities from Hammerfell? Preposterous! I'm simply facilitating a transaction between treasure hunters and a rich collector.\n\nSo, who am I paying the bribe to? You or the high king?
Introductions! Sorry. Ugh … if my master could see this, he'd be aghast.\n\nGwendis of House Ravenwatch, at your service.
I have some idea. There's one just below, tucked away in the back of the town.\n\nPhebe may be … indisposed for the moment, so I'm counting on you to join me. Keep her whistle on you, we may need it.
Markarth mead. Hmm. Ena deals with the Reach from time to time, though usually indirectly.\n\nThe arrow, however. It worries me. Only Reachmen use Druadach snow owl feathers to fletch their arrows.
I found the camp. Thought it was deserted, but the assassin must have been hiding in the shadows. He got the drop on me.
Right, skulking in the shadows. Lead the way. I'm right behind you.
While Fenn and I examine that ritual site more closely, you should return to Solitude and inform Svana that her mother's assassin has been taken care of. She'd want to know.\n\nMore than that, she deserves to know.
Practically my whole life. I served in his army when we drove the Reach-dogs back from our gates. The Wolf chased them halfway over the Druadach Mountains before he declared the campaign finished. He was a man to be feared and admired.
Plenty of axe-swings and a few kicks in the stomach, I wager.\n\nThese witches will protect the ritual with their lives. We'll make sure they pay in full.
Karthwatch trains their guards to hide villagers down here during Reach raids. It proved impenetrable in the past … until today.
Violence between Reachmen and the Nords of Karth has lasted generations. They take our land and we push back. Even after building Karthwatch, we still endure raids. And, each time more of our neighbors fall. Bjora shouldn't suffer for their crimes.
A storm straight from Mauloch's arsehole rose up over the town. It twisted everyone I know into monsters.\n\nIn the chaos, I saw my brother Hafskjar and his friend Bjora take people to the barrow west of town. But I've heard nothing since.
You're right. I know you're right. It's just—he's my father!\n\nNo, I have to focus. The harrowstorm. It's coming. We have to save the city. There's nothing more important than that right now.
You should leave.
That makes it even more important that he heeds your warning and takes action. All of the holds are in danger. Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, Karthald … my father needs to do something before another storm strikes.\n\nMeet me at the Blue Palace, all right?
Alas, no. But now, having seen them up close, I'm growing more and more convinced that someone is helping them. A shadowy researcher of some kind. This person may even be financing the expeditions. Not a comforting thought, that.
Leave? But we're so close to figuring this out! If we just had a little more time … and maybe a set of extra hands. \n\nYou look very clever! I'm sure if you joined us, we'd solve this in no time. Interested? Claudina would reward you, I'm sure.
No. Many in my order would frown on it. We Nords have a … fraught relationship with magic. But I feel such a sense of communion when I take flight.\n\nFeeling the wind rustle through my feathers … it's as if Kyne and I are dancing.
The Skald-King is in Solitude? Shor's bones, no one tells Rigurt anything!\n\nWell. Rigurt has never failed a mission! He will do his best to see this one through, for the good of his people!
It's a rocky outpost on the Sea of Ghosts. A fort, some ruins, a fishing village ….\n\nThe only reason we settled on it was its location. It serves as a bulwark against northern invasions. But the defenders never counted on an invasion like this.
Her methods trouble me. We've always upheld our traditions, and they've served us well.\n\nNow, Chief Urzikh has grand ideas about a prosperous future and expanding the stronghold. We don't need anything more than what we already have.
She's an alchemist. I'm a mine overseer. I think I've got a better handle on how to move stone.\n\nUgh. It was only a matter of time before her pride betrayed us. Guess it's fitting that we both get crushed together down here.
Of course. Truthfully, I only asked in jest.\n\nI will find recruits in Bangkorai Garrison, Hallin's Stand, perhaps even Evermore. And before I pass on to the Far Shores, I will make sure an incursion like this never happens again. You have my word.
<Add the third ingredient to craft the stonemelt solution.>
The assassin may have leapt out the window, but he must have had help to get that close to the king and queen. Even Jorunn's guard had traitors willing to help the coven, so why not here, too?\n\nHmm. What was the name of that Orc at the Lonely Troll?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. One moment I was back in Morrowind, but it was different. Vivec City was a smoking crater. The next I was underwater and struggling to breathe. Then I was falling into a volcano. Then I was here.
Yeah … yeah. It's not like I opened the gate and let him slink off. The real problem's at the palace.\n\nNo more questions. I've got to secure the gate and take care of poor Sonolia.
Today? No, the time isn't right. As for the future, who can say? Svargrim was never interested in finding a path to reconciliation.\n\nPrincess Svana isn't her father, that much is clear. So, I suppose I can hope, hmm?
Priests and pilgrims of Meridia. They must have sought shelter in the temple before this terrible fate befell them.\n\nIf only they had been able to make it inside.
Obviously, Fennorian's elixir is key to protecting Solitude from the harrowstorm. He has to make enough to distribute, and he has to do it quickly without making the slightest mistake.\n\nThat's a responsibility he won't take lightly.
Besides being an important lumber town, Dragon Bridge serves as the crossroads for the northern region. We're the first line of defense for Solitude and the neighboring holds.\n\nThough in our current state, I'm not sure how much good we can do.
Careful, outsider. We don't take kindly to that kind of attitude when it's directed at our high king. If you want to know so badly, go ask your precious princess.\n\nNow leave us to our work before I decide to herd you right to the dungeons.
That's what I've been saying! I've never seen the lass's brow so wrinkled. Svana's face will furrow like a wheat field if she keeps it up.\n\nShe should reclaim her seat in the tavern and stop trying to get closer to the throne.
The Pale Man took their loved ones, as it has taken so many over the years. These people are witnesses, so I need to know what they saw.\n\nI can't return whoever they lost, but I can track the thing down and kill it.
Along the northern coast, you say? Hmm. Yes. That might narrow it down. Here, follow me inside.
No one knows what make those walking corpses move, but we do know they stop moving if you hack them up enough. We need intact, non-moving parts to make a body that will draw out the Pale Man.\n\nOne draugr won't do, but parts of dozens? That might.
I don't know how it works, exactly, only that it's something the hagravens created. Somehow, the clever woman stole it away from them. \n\nWhen poured on dead flesh, it creates a scent that drives anyone who smells it mad with hunger.
You assemble them into a body that tempts the Pale Man. Take these sharp bones. Jam them into the torso. Then stick the arms, legs, and head onto them. Gruesome work, but it should hold.\n\nPour on the pungent mixture I've made and you have your bait.
Tzinghalis's helper made a mistake. Forgot to lock the chains when I was brought back after one of my … treatments.\n\nI can still feel the fire from when the needle pierced my skin. My blood, flowing into his vials and beakers. It wasn't pleasant.
If the jarl is still alive, she can take care of herself for a while longer.\n\nThe witch hasn't gathered all the reliquaries yet. I say we get to them first and destroy them. I won't let these bastards profit off the destruction of Karthwatch.
No! I hope not? I disobeyed because I saw a threat and took the initiative to deal with it. And nothing bad happened, so that's a good thing, right?\n\nYou should join us! I'll mark our location on your map. Meet me there and I can pay you.
Svana does as she pleases. Always has.\n\nShe's on the rise while this old Orc fades away. With any luck, she'll have a chance to grow as fat and useless as me.
Ah, no, of course you wouldn't be. Skyrim is a land of hard people and hard drinkers. Who has any use for the skill to read, write, and reason these days? Few here, I assure you.\n\nVery well. I will seek others who are willing to learn.
It varies. A friend of mine started showing symptoms a week before she was lost entirely. Others succumb overnight. \n\nI couldn't save them, but I will do what I can for those who remain. Alchemist Rasir was close to a cure. I must find him.
Almost as soon as we heard Rasir was missing, Skor was asking after him. I told him the same thing I told you. \n\nWe haven't seen him since then. He must still be out searching … don't know how he's still standing, much less trying to find Rasir.
He looked exhausted. His worry for Rasir seemed to take precedence, however. \n\nIt's not unlike him. He's always protecting everyone else. He sometimes forgets to protect himself.
You are a curious one, are you?\n\nHmm, where to begin? I assume you're familiar with Secundus Antilliax Pomo's work: The Harmonics of Motivational Force as Applied to Post-Dwemer Animunculi.
I haven't the faintest idea. That's the best part. Whatever your findings are, it'll all be uncharted territory for me. I could use more interesting reading material while I'm out here looking for quality research assistants.
Well, your Antiquities Codex contains only those antiquities we're currently aware of. If you want to make a unique discovery of your own, you'll need to find a lead. Something that gives you a place to start.
That's what I use to train'em! Goats are plenty smart, you know? Stubborn, sure, but smart! They're more cooperative once they're a bit sloshed on fermented berries. A handful should calm their nerves and stoke their appetites enough to head home.
Thank the Divines! I've exhausted my current material, which consists entirely of local folklore. There is simply no credible evidence that Goblins or Reiklings live in this region. Any who did were likely driven out by Nords and Reachmen long ago.
Well, I'll be. I thought <<1>> was just telling me they'd look into it to get me to go away.\n\nShe told you that it's some sort of colossus? A big lumbering thing with whirling blades that spray fire and steam everywhere? And that it's getting bigger?
Yes, of course, though I fear what we may find there. The temple was clearly at the center of the storm.\n\nRegardless, there's still a lot we don't know about the effects of this ritual. Observing the target area could offer new insights.
That's it! The glass is fading away …. I'm—Oh!
No, no that's not it! Damn, my ears are ringing! Well not my ears … I don't have any— Oh, you know what I mean! Read a different line!
Rigurt may be a poor angler, but he is still the best ambassador in all of Tamriel! \n\nAnd he happens to know how to acquire the perfect fishing bait from his time among the Argonians in Shadowfen.
A clever woman? Out here? Nords are extremely distrustful of magic, especially Nords from Western Skyrim. I'm surprised the people of Morthal tolerate her presence.\n\nIf anyone can help Fenn figure out the coven's ritual, though, it would be her.
An icy rime clings to the wolves, sapping the heat and life from their bodies until only a frigid, shambling corpse remains.\n\nYou are safe from them here, but be mindful out in the wild.
I know nothing about Bjora's heritage. She was alone when I found her. A small baby wailing in a crib. If she was so important, why would those barbarians put her in harm's way?\n\nBesides, she's my daughter now. I don't care what she was before.
I knew it. Wise of him to send an associate like you to offer an olive branch. Cowardly, but wise.
How would I not? Ancient mysteries are Narsis Dren's stock-in-trade! No arcane relic or lost antiquity evades my gaze for long.\n\nSurely you've read some of my books? They're best-sellers, assistant. I can get you some at a very reasonable price.
He told me to stay behind. He didn't want any more harm to come to me. I tried to convince him otherwise but he insisted.\n\nI agreed to stay behind and watch over the others, but when neither Skor or Rasir returned, I got worried.
Thank you … please don't let my work go to waste.
Heh. This one has seen better moons.\n\nI … I do not know if any trace of Essenia's corruption still flows through my veins. Adusa feels weak, but clear-headed. Unlike the bloodknights. Only time will tell, yes?
Of course. Some may choose to blame her for her father's misdeeds, but I will seek forgiveness from them. There have been enough divisions of blood and feuding. It is a new day. This is a time to mend rifts and forge new bonds.
When things are settled here. Hjaalmarch has weathered these storms better than Haafingar and Karthald—if we can keep the kingdom from complete collapse, it's worth a few weeks away from my home and hearth.
Just wondering if they could bury the hatchet long enough to get us out of this. That business between them is going to come to a head sooner or later. I say let's get it over with.\n\nThis whole disaster is their fault. Both of them!
We're looking for the same thing, my friend. I want to learn more about the ritual they performed here. With any luck, that investigation will turn up evidence you can bring to the queen.\n\nAt the very least, we might figure out their next move.
The word of an outsider isn't worth mammoth spit. Keep sticking your nose where it doesn't belong and you'll wind up just like him.\n\nMind your own business or you'll find that Solitude doesn't take kindly to instigators and strangers.
I can't leave everything to you, you know. Well, I probably could, but even Ysgramor took a rest now and again. Let us shoulder the burden for a while. I'm sure I'll need to call on you again soon enough.
A shame, but no. We require something much more powerful to undo magic this strong. Energy directly connected to the curse's origins. The rabbit blood from which I drew the magicka to charge that rune will not suffice.
I grew up in a very traditional stronghold.\n\nChildhood in a stronghold's not so bad, but everybody grows up eventually. An Orc like me gets two choices: kowtow to the chieftain, or challenge him for leadership. I didn't intend to do either.
I honestly can't remember ever wanting to do anything else.\n\nMy mother insists I wanted to be a banker as a child. I certainly don't remember it, but who knows? I suppose all bright four year-olds entertain frivolous fantasies like that.
Oh, yes, she was. I loved her dearly. And, I truly believe Maxten loved me back. When she realized she'd accidentally cursed me, she swore to find a cure. But as time went on, growing her necromantic power became her only interest.
Not exactly. I mean, I admit that vampires often like to stir up gratuitous trouble. But Lady Thorn always kept to herself in the past. Very strange that she wants to build an army now.
I wish this news surprised me. After I left to come home, I feared Maxten would no longer reign in her desire for power.\n\nHer ambition attracted me when we first met. Over time, she grew increasingly fixated. Eventually, I no longer recognized her.
Ah, young blood, the battle for Solitude might be over, but the war's just begun. You've given us a fighting chance, but there's still an army of vampires, werewolves, and witchmen out there seeking our destruction. Now we must beat them back.
Maybe. I suggested she visit my sister and their children in Solitude. It's a big city with many people who don't know her. It could be a fresh start.
Make sure you find out what he knows about all this. I need the full story. I need to know who's to blame.\n\nEven if it's me.
And every one of them gave up their life willingly. They gladly died to awaken the Dark Heart from its slumber! Arana may deny it, but this is the day Namira has been preparing us for. \n\nWe give our souls to the dark in return for eternal life!
Until we find the source, I can only speculate. We need to locate it, learn more about this energy, and determine the true nature of these shades.\n\nIf Rada and Lady Belain can harness this dark energy, I hate to imagine what they could accomplish.
I know precious little. I never visited the site myself.\n\nThough incomplete, the historical record indicates the survivor hid in a concealed space that they were guided to. Perhaps that has something to do with the idea of being worthy.
What? Verandis, how could you? I don't want to believe it and yet here it is, right before my very eyes. Why didn't he ever tell me? I thought I knew everything there was to know about him. \n\nNo, there has to be more. What else does the letter say?
We gave our loyalty to Caddach long before he became ard. We are his sword, his shield, and his counsel. There are many threats in the Reach. Too many for one person. So we deal with the ones the ard can't handle.
Correct. I don't know what becomes of the spirits of Reachfolk who die away from their clan, but to the Wildblood, it seems those talismans are an important part of guiding their loved one's spirit home.\n\nBring them back, if you can find them.
Yes, and it's a darker story than we were led to believe. Not only was Verandis a member of the Gray Host and a close confidant of Rada al-Saran, he was also the architect of their rebirth.\n\nI hope he's truly ready to face him when the time comes.
It's true that Rada often relied on myself and later Tzinghalis to handle his research and experiments. But he wasn't without his own skills when it came to arcana and alchemy.\n\nI suppose during his long isolation, he had to increase his aptitude.
I've been thinking about what you told me. I believe the Ghostsong ritual primed the Dark Heart, opening a path between this world and the Void. The void energy is stronger here, but it lacks direction.\n\nI fear they require a greater sacrifice.
I was really hoping Verandis had something tricky up his sleeve. I guess there's nothing left to do but smack Rada al-Saran in his self-righteous face.\n\nYou just bring Verandis back. Promise me.
You did what you thought was best and the price I paid has been returned. None of us could have imagined this is where our path would lead, but I've no complaints with the outcome. No complaints at all.
Western Skyrim has begun to recover. With Fenn's elixir, our soldiers have been able to push back the Gray Host. I know the Reach has not been so fortunate. I persuaded Prince Irnskar, and the Skald-King, to offer our support.
I'd say being home has been nice, but you'd know I'd be lying. The Skald-King owes me some rest. Think we'll take our leave of Skyrim and spend some time free of obligations.\n\nAlways wanted to go back to Skingrad.
Aye, we'll fight. There aren't many of us left, but most of us are werewolves. Lady Belain will regret the day she turned our own witches against the clan. That, I promise you. We'll make our way to Rebel's Retreat. I'll look for you and Arana there.
Well done, harrier.\n\nNow, once we undertake this ritual, we will be bound by blood and spirit. It's a union stronger than stone and more eternal than the stars. Are you ready for such a commitment?
Mannimarco didn't call me confidant. When he departed, he said the failure here would forge his success elsewhere. I never saw him again.\n\nIf you want to know his mind, you'll have to see what he wrought yourself. I'll open the way for you.
Freyleth has a plan. A way to replace Boss Trenlor and choose a new leader. Someone who wants to improve the Lothid instead of aggrandizing their own position. Once that happens, I can leave.\n\nTalk to Freyleth. She explains things better than I do.
I sensed some deception, but her illusion is powerful. How else did she hide her nature from me?\n\nAs for Arana, do you think we can convince her and her rebels to join our cause?
You spoke to Rada? Did he—? No matter. If Rada al-Saran is here, our time grows short.\n\nTalk to Caddach. If he deems what you tell him worthy, maybe he'll finally be willing to work with me. Then we can figure out how to deal with the Gray Host.
The darkness crashes against my mind like waves slamming into the shore. It can be … distracting. I can function normally, with the occasional need to pause and let the sensation pass.\n\nI can't yet control the darkness, but I haven't been idle.
Oh, I'll admit, I do miss the trees. But everyone is so friendly here, and the food, mmm. There's so much of it! Delicious, squirmy, screaming food.\n\nDoes that bother you? The screaming? I recall us discussing such things last time we spoke.
I don't know yet. But it's imperative I figure it out. The safety of Tamriel could rely on it.\n\nLook, Lady Thorn is a threat. And I've seen you fight. No matter what she throws at you, I know you can handle it. You must take her down.
Rada aligned the orrey in order to make his escape. Use the keystone on the Dwarven mechanisms that control it. That should open a breach we can travel through.\n\nThen maybe I'll have a chance to stop this storm I created.
We know all about the blood-drinkers and the beast-folk. We were dealing with them just fine before Ard Caddach called us back to Markarth.\n\nThe witch-rebels are a bigger threat. Along with outsiders who try to get into our business.
I got to say goodbye. There was so much more I wanted to say to him … but at least there was that.\n\nI need some time, but I'll carry on.
Aye. We've trod in circles with blood and rage clouding our eyes for as long as anyone can remember, but just now we've glimpsed a new path off this endless trail of suffering. Peace is on the horizon and we're for it now with all we've got.
That's Eamon, the first among our hunters. He's as fearsome as a Giant and just as thick-headed.\n\nHe's been up in arms since the storm. Seeing me bring you into the village hasn't calmed his disposition one bit.
Before we reclaimed Karthwasten for our clan, outsiders built deep tunnels to exploit the land. The Crow-Eye have no interest in such things, so we left them abandoned. \n\nMy people mostly avoid the place, truth be told.
I feared you might say that. But it's my problem to deal with. I can have to sort it out … somehow. Thanks anyway.
I was meant to stop the Gray Host from recruiting a clan of vampires. I tried to convince them that they'd just be used as pawns. But … they all ignored me. My mission failed. \n\nHow can I explain this to the rest of House Ravenwatch?
No one has entered or departed by these doors in all the time I've been here. It's clear that Rada and Belain know more about this old Dwarven structure than we do, though.\n\nThey must have another way to come and go as they need.
Well …. Candlelight, flowers, a place that doesn't crawl with danger at every turn. \n\nNot many bards tell romance stories about vampires, but we can still feel love, you know.
What, you expect me to curl up in a tent or house, like those thinbloods in Markarth? Give me the wilds any day. I only need the open sky over my head to feel calm.
When all the drama has come to an end, the Eagleseers and the Six-Fords are still going to hate each other. Nothing will change that.\n\nAs for my niece, she won't do anything she doesn't want to. I'd feel sorry for Madearn—if he wasn't a Six-Ford.
Didn't the chief-of-chiefs tell you? I'm the daughter of Chief Eagleseer. Or I was. I have half a mind to exile myself and cut all ties to my damned clan.\n\nI tell you, I won't be the barter that ends the feud. I won't!
Ah, yes. Red Eagle was a great warrior as well as a great teacher.\n\nAll I can tell you is that an ancient cave sits below this sacred redoubt. If this particular song is meant for you and your friends, you will find the answers you seek there.
It was one of a few pitched battles between the Six-Fords and Eagleseers in ages past. There was no clear victor. Both sides slaughtered almost to the last man. And woman.\n\nIt took place in the lea of the Karthspire.
I … think so. I'm just worried about Madearn. If we're to be married, I don't want there to be any guilt. \n\nBefore we complete the handfasting, I just want to thank you for everything you've done. Your heart is of the Reach.
Part of me wanted to, no doubt. I've grown fond of Eslyn. But what kind of man would I be if I went back on my word just because of that? Promises must mean more than fickle emotion, or I cannot call myself a man of the Reach.
The Gray Host? We've heard of these invaders, but so far they've left our village alone. Until now, I guess.\n\nI won't pretend to understand the whole of it … but this affront to the Reach and its people, there will be a reckoning.
It was purely by chance. When Lyris and I helped the people at the Reachwind Ritual Site, we discovered a letter on the Gray Host leader. A number of the vampire commanders were discussing the story through correspondence.\n\nI was intrigued.
You've seen those dark storms swirling over the Reach? The Gray Host calls them harrowstorms.\n\nTheir witches conjure them up using harrowcraft. From what we can tell, it requires all sorts of ingredients. Fetishes and alchemical mixtures mostly.
The Wayward Guardians trust you, harrier. Of that, have no doubt.\n\nBut the people of Markarth need to see those sigils hanging from the ramparts. They need to know that they have nothing more to fear. That we are here to defend them.
I returned to save Freyleth and the clan from Boss Trenlor. I accomplished that. I know the clan is better off than it was. That it has a more promising future. But that future doesn't include me.\n\nMy path leads in a different direction.
With your warning, Ard Caddach can decide what to do with Lady Belain's advice in the future. As to why they care that Reachfolk gather within the city, I'll need to think about that.\n\nDid you hear anything else of significance during their exchange?
Each day, I reach more Eagleseers with the tale you helped us discover. I believe many are beginning to reconsider the feud with the Six-Fords. It will take time before there's peace … but I still have hope.
I think breaking his word to Drisene still weighs heavy on him. Though I hear she's found a new love already, Madearn still worries. \n\nI do my best to comfort him. It's easier now that our clans aren't feuding … as much as they used to, anyway.
I don't see how. Rada al-Saran was a Yokudan swordmaster before he came to Tamriel. His vampirism is the result of a meeting with Molag Bal. At least, that's how I understand it.\n\nLady Belain, however. Her origins are unknown to me.
Our relationship with the land and the Daedra does not have so clearly defined rules. It could be anything from a whisper of thanks, or returning seeds to the dirt. \n\nIt's not as complicated as you might think. Consider it while you're in the Reach.
Freyleth says the darkcap will work instantly. Weaken Trenlor so he's more like other vampires. Then Freyleth will launch the final stage of her plan.\n\nShe'll challenge Trenlor for leadership of the clan.
Bah, it's not an uncommon thing for packs of dire wolves to make off with livestock. My soldiers haven't been able to deal with them with all this Gray Host madness.\n\nNext time you're headed to Morthal, lend my wife a hand and you'll have my thanks.
I did say I'd sell you the map to Bthar-Zel, but I'm not sure I could determine a fair price. The map is extremely rare and valuable, as I'm sure you know.
An Imperial cache lies beyond that concealed doorway. Unfortunately, the entrance has been warded to prevent anyone, including those of my kind, from passing through.\n\nI require a capable mortal to shatter the ward so we can see what's hidden inside.
Xynaa's contracts mentioned it. The rites it describes allowed Vandacia to imbue us with a portion of Dagon's energy. I think he took a little for himself along the way, which is why he's so powerful.\n\nI want to try to take that energy away from him.
Then let me help! Sombren has been holding me back. I don't care if I lose control, so long as I take Vandacia with me.\n\nFind him. Keep him busy. I'll make sure he pays for Destron.
You may call me Lyranth. I know that most Dremora like myself behave maliciously toward mortals, but I promise you have nothing to fear.\n\nWell, unless you find a way to upset me.
Easy to say, hard to do. Still ….\n\nSo many people fought to protect me today. Even though my heart is broken, for their sakes I'll find a way. Destron would want me to.
Allowing Quistley to be dragged off to angry criminals is not much of an improvement. While Quistley might deserve it, I can't let Tenarei Vels get him, either.\n\nI want to try to grab one of these cultists and get some answers.
Well, prisoner, actually. He stopped by to show him off. Gave me a preview of his big event.\n\nPlease, I—I shouldn't be telling you any of this. It goes against our code!
It all goes back to Leovic's secret. How he hid the Four Ambitions right before Varen killed him and took the throne.\n\nWe thought the Ambitions were Daedric weapons, but they turned out to be people! Vandacia wants the power they contain.
My spymaster reports a flurry of activity that is troublesome. And Gideon is not the fortress it once was. Even so, my Black Fin Legion will give as good as it gets. Better even.\n\nWhat most concerns me is the possibility of treachery.
I need you to paint some stabilizing runes around the area to reinforce the censer's magics.\n\nThey're not all that elaborate, I promise. But do be mindful. I'm not leaving anything to chance this time!
Just pay attention to the energies flowing between them. If no spectral motes pass through one of the pylons, you'll know that's the one that needs fixing.\n\nI should warn you—if you try to attune a functional pylon, you might feel a … mild shock.
With happiness, love, and so, so much pent up aggression. Jad'zirri sprinkles her special blend of spices onto her feet and gives the tub of overripe apples a thorough stomping. It is quite joyful. Then she sieves the slop into her still and voila!
Oh, not me, little mortal. I have no intention of slogging through the muck and the sludge when you are more than capable of handling that.\n\nI shall catch up to you after you have dealt with the wards. Go on now, and take the Wood Elf with you.
But you saw how Vandacia looked. Strong, powerful. And Mehrunes Dagon looking down on us. How do we stand against that?
First things first. I need to restore my power. Let me think ….\n\nXynaa told me about an old foe she destroyed. Tossed them into this place and kept their skull as a trophy. It may hold enough energy to recharge my power immediately!
Let me take another look at Xynaa's contracts. Yes, it's here.\n\nXynaa used a holy book to show Vandacia how to create the Four Ambitions. Could it have been the Mysterium Xarxes? She was always loyal to Dagon. She never wanted to help us at all.
Hopefully, they're either still locked in a vault or wandering free like I was. I hate to think that Vandacia captured them while we were busy elsewhere.\n\nI'm … I'm not sure what we should do next, my friend. It's beginning to seem hopeless.
I'll try to train the twins as Xynaa trained me. If all else fails, I can take them back to the Deadlands. The realm seems to naturally siphon off our energy and keep it at manageable levels.\n\nNot my first choice, but it will serve as a last resort.
While it is true that the souls of these Shadowscales returned to the Hist long ago, their remains still deserve peace. Their bones need not become puppets to a madman drunk on power.\n\nBurning them is the only way to prevent that.
The vault is warded, little mortal. Wards that repel Daedra—including me. You and the Elf, however, should have no trouble. Just remove the wards and we can both satisfy our curiosity.\n\nOh, and tell the Elf I think I know what tome she carries.
Indeed. We've all had to make choices about what we're willing to risk to attain our desires. Cres's bargain promises perfection without the sacrifice. Who wouldn't be tempted?\n\nIs a life without need or want truly fulfilling? I can't say.
Like we were in some sort of in-between place. Like a piece of Oblivion had somehow overlaid a portion of Nirn.\n\nConfusing, right? But that's what happens when you get mixed up with Daedric magic. Now go turn those cubes!
Well, we did take down all the wards that protected this place.\n\nI put arrows in as many of Vandacia's crazies as I could, but the rest of them scattered.
Since last our paths crossed, I ran afoul of these Mehrunes Dagon followers. While I was investigating their activities, I ran into … an obstacle.\n\nAs much as it pains me to admit, but this requires a mortal's touch. I need your assistance.
Since the events at the Cauldron, I have been chasing these Dagonists. After running into a few dead ends, I encountered … an obstacle.\n\nIt pains me to admit it, but this requires a mortal's touch. I need your assistance. little mortal.
What else would you call it? He stayed true to the teachings and carried the resolve of Zenithar in his heart to endure, even as everything around him crumbled to dust. Faith like that is worth far more than gold.\n\nWe can learn much from Gavos.
Help, of course. I've devoted my life to liberating people from their troubles—however briefly—and if I can't do that from a stage then I will take my talents where they are most needed.
They got what they were after, and now they're sending their forces to kill the rest of the councilors. With the other councilors dead, Vandacia will be the only person who knows the secret of the Longhouse Emperors.
So he could. If he were satisfied with iced rolls grown stale from weeks on the road. But when one offers the chance to have them at their freshest and most perfect, always and forever, why would Bugtail not take such a bargain?
Yes! What else would one dream about? Have you never known the ecstasy of sweet moon-sugar cream melting upon your tongue? This one has not tasted true sugar since he left Elsweyr. He has missed it so.
I saw the Dagonists use magic to temporarily disable the ward. Their power is limited however, and the ward reasserted itself before I could follow them.\n\nOnly power akin to the amulet can totally destroy the ward.
Yes. Now that I've studied the energy, I can detect it quite clearly. Getting through the initial ward must have expended a tremendous amount of power. I suspect the cultists haven't recovered enough as yet to replicate their earlier efforts.
Then I guess you've reached a dead end. Farrul never told me much. Just that he needed the book he sent Eveli to find. That he had to correct a terrible mistake.\n\nHe also mentioned that Leovic told him things, but he never got into specifics.
No, no. When the Wind dies, the title passes to another of their choosing. There is a big celebration with drinks and dancing. And, a little bonding, if you understand.\n\nWe treasure the Four Winds. I do not know why they abandoned us.
It's not like this is how I dreamed of getting married, but after being jilted so many times I may as well marry a man who can't change his mind.\n\nYou may not get it, but for your sake I hope you never have to.
Most certainly. Moments after the captain brought Councilor Lovidicus the news, the councilor summoned Teb and myself. He explained everything. \n\nHe should have done so sooner. Allowed us to help. But I know he thought he was doing the right thing.
Oh yes, I can sense that raging fire in your stout heart. I suspect you have slain many a foe in your travels. But if we are to go into battle together, I must put a fire in your belly as well.\n\nAnd so, we're going to do … a drinking contest!
Well, it has been many hundreds of years. I suppose Phalevon's arms and armor might not be much to look at now. But in any condition they would be of immense historical value. I simply know it!
Remove his symbol of authority. Walk into his chambers and pull down his banners. That way his troops will know he is broken. \n\nIf they don't outright turn on themselves, they'll likely steal what they can and flee. Hired hands are fickle.
I can still hear the creeper fighting with that tree, for one, and the tree's losing. We've got to do something about the vines strangling its roots and kill the creeper.
Hmph. I suppose that's your attempt at being clever. Very well. I'll rise to the bait. The sooner we're done with this the better.\n\nKnow this, however—I'll not employ his silly, whack-a-hackwing methodology. Witness a true mage in action.
She has a soft spot for people. Nothing makes her happier than bringing joy to others. When she sees people suffering, she just can't abide it. Her bleeding heart can be a bit of an inconvenience, but it makes her a good mentor. And friend.
She's made all sorts of acts of kindness on the road, big and small. Never for the praise. Alchemy may enjoy her accolades for her acting, but she's usually discreet with her charity. She even raised money for the orphanage in Leyawiin!
The kind that comes with a terrible curse and has the locals all in a tither! Nisswo Somarz is very cross with me. She insists I return to the xanmeer and set things right. And Stibbons isn't any help. Not in his current state. Will you assist me?
You're telling me this Cres didn't take her place, they traded for it? And not just her, but everyone here. What does Cres have to gain from these bargains? To infiltrate the town? What could a sleepy village offer someone who can create dreams?
Better. He's stopped staring at me, wondering if I'm real. I told him everything. I thought he might disown me for it, but he was just glad to hear me confide in him again.
A Wood Elf slipped out of the shadows … but not one of my mates. Said her name was Eveli Sharp-Arrow.\n\nShe made sure I wasn't bleeding too badly and went in after the cultists.
Theater, conservatory, circus, salon, temple! The House of Reveries wears as many guises as we do. It is the ancestral home of all the performing arts in Summerset, and the world if you believe some of the Sapiarchs.
No idea. But hopefully speaking with the lieutenant will shed some light on that. If his people are innocent, then he might help guide us to the real enemy.\n\nAnd if they are not, then I will strike them down with the power of a graht oak!
Oh, I used the last one saving your hide. I'm not too troubled about it. You know how treasure can be—lightly come, lightly go.\n\nCome on, let's find that book!
The mark of the Dark Brotherhood, just like Farrul Lupus.\n\nRemember I said I was going to find Lovidicus? Well, I did. And turns out, he's the head of the city's Chamber of Legates! I just wish another person hadn't died because of this damn secret.
Of course! The Crow Mother taught us to speak, and since then we have talked and cawed with the utmost elegance! \n\nI have the honor of being named the Duke, for I am the loudest of my loyal vassals. My feathers are also the most resplendent!
Wherever the wind takes us, crow-friend. Though, after this harrowing experience, we may return to Crow's Wood. \n\nI long for our skirmishes with the bats. Our gallant knights could use a fierce battle to forget this insult. A victory!
I suppose the story's not well known outside of court circles. My father was one of High King Emeric's most trusted advisors. But when I was only a toddler, he plotted to secretly murder Emeric and appoint himself regent. Or so I'm told.
Trying to pitch me into Orkey's gnarled teeth—or Dagon's rather. Felt like all the air was sucked out of my lungs. Would have killed me if you hadn't come along.\n\nWas it always this hot in here?
Smash, smash! Destroy the mirror and my vassals will be free! \n\nNo longer will we be cowed and bound to these featherless masters. These fools will feel the sharpness of our beaks, the cutting wind of our feathers! Go, my tall soldier! Go!
So you do know about them. I figured. You seem to be taking this all so calmly, like you've seen all this horror and worse.\n\nSo these Waking Flame folks are still around? If our killer was one of them, that means they've been in Gideon for decades.
Vinnus, h-he's dead? How? \n\nNo, he wouldn't want me to mourn when there is still work to be done. This letter mentions a stone. Hand it to me. Carefully!
The Happy Averno Shipping Company was gifted to my brother and I by our dear departed uncle. Formerly, it was one of Blackwood's main trade enterprises. We thought, with a little elbow grease, it might prove a profitable venture.
Sophus is dead? Damn! Was it the Dark Brotherhood? What am I saying, of course it was!\n\nI've torn this place apart, but so far I haven't found anything related to Imperial secrets or the Ambitions. Maybe you can spot something I missed.
Squeezing information out of the Dark Elves is delicate business. To be honest, we know far less about what's going on in Morrowind than we should.\n\nI can tell you that Vivec put out a summons for heroes recently. That's worrying.
She apparently has been investigating this so-called Longhouse Emperor secret for a while now. She approached Councilor Lovidicus with news of the murder and evidence to suggest the rest of the Elder Council were in danger.
It was just a flash, but it was accompanied by a feeling. I felt a sense of overwhelming evil, all tied up in the figure I saw in my mind. \n\nLike someone held a portrait in front of my face for just a moment and then pulled it away.
That's because it is bad.\n\nLet's pick up the pace, all right?
I don't know! Look for a lever or a crank wheel or something. Maybe through that door over there? Let's go!
A good question. Perhaps the cost of that victory was too high. Or Gavos's desecration was too great for Zenithar to forgive. \n\nIf anyone was to have kept records of what actually transpired, it would be the trade-ministers.
I did not know how dangerous this ancient magic truly was! I did not understand my actions were the cause of all this … not until I heard about the bodies you and Heem-Jas found. \n\nAnd once I realized, it was already too late.
Giovanni is a kind person and Darene is … abrasive, but she stood up for all of us when we were little. I know them, they aren't bad people.\n\nAnd if I'm right about Tumma-Maxath, no one deserves the fate he has in store for them.
Something's got him on edge, he won't talk to any of us. The members of the Black Fin Legion are easily recognizable in Gideon. \n\nI need someone he won't see coming. I want you to see if you can speak with him and learn what he and Xocin discussed.
It is less of a concern now that we know they mean us no harm. But to ensure lasting peace, you are correct, we will need to negotiate. \n\nWe did as much to sully relations between our people, if not more. My tribe is prepared to make compromises.
Then perhaps this child is less a fool and ingrate than my own. No doubt you've been told I died in pursuit of my stolen puzzle box, but that is not the whole story. I was murdered. I came too close to the truth and I was silenced for it.
Having Xyria by my side once more will certainly outweigh any risk. So what if a few more Dremora come looking for a fight? We will banish them back to Oblivion. Together.\n\nThank you, my friend. I'll begin the summoning shortly.
I'm so glad! I really can't thank you enough for doing this. I would go myself but it really is quite dangerous. I care deeply for these insects, but I know I'd be no help to them dead.\n\nBut you look incredibly strong, I'm sure you can rescue them!
The king's officials thought Lady Clairene might be disloyal too. They commanded me to take young Bastian to the house of a minor lord and keep him there for a few months until they were sure she had nothing to do with Lord Hallix's treason.
If Quistley is supposed to give it to Mauriene Bouchend, then yes.\n\nI don't want to see the Silvelles come to grief. A betrothal between two houses? It's important to a lot of people. And maybe it's what Quistley needs.
Good, but what are you doing over here then? Go splash it on Leric before it loses its potency!
Knew that would get your attention, I'm not the sort of woman who would lie you know. Can't tell you where it is, not with all these little ones running around. They don't want it to be too easy for you.\n\nI can give you a hint though.
Yes, of course they did. I had to convince them that my new wife was appalled by what her father had done and repudiated the Hallix name.\n\nNot only was Clairene at risk—my own house might have fallen under suspicion of treason, too.
He had no great liking for it. He was a staunch loyalist and took Lord Hallix's plot against the high king as a personal offense. It took a rather exceptional inducement to persuade him to take in young Bastian.
Not much, really. The place is filled with all kinds of wild and dangerous creatures. Like Sister of Pools, the Nereid who cursed my stupid brother.\n\nLook, if you want to explore the ruins, go ahead. But could you help me restore Deet-Loh first?
I have heard the name. The Daughter of Sithis herself has him.\n\nThese miserable Sithis … pretenders. I can show you the passage you seek. I'll consider it payback for the way they locked me up.
What I know is that I lost someone today, someone who died trying to get this device into my hands. I might have theories later but for now, I need to figure out what Vinnus died for without the influence of my own theories. I owe him that.
An august body that advised the Emperors and maintained the Imperial bureaucracy. It was disbanded with the collapse of the Empire.\n\nMany of the former councilors came here to escape the war in Cyrodiil. They retain their titles as a sign of respect.
Me and my sister work as servants here at the fort. Talaise was on kitchen duty. When the councilor called for a meal, it fell to her to deliver it to the watchtower.\n\nBut Talaise never returned to the kitchen and no one has seen her since!
I got my mom's knack for adventure and my dad's levelheadedness, so I'm the only one who's both crazy enough to go after her and sane enough to talk some sense into her.\n\nI also happen to be their eldest child, so it's my filial duty to the house.
Hah, not so much. Our family is of little consequence, so we're free to be a bunch of impetuous miscreants chasing our own whims. If I'd been born to one of the Great Houses, I'd either be a pawn in their schemes or a disappointment, like father.
The Khajiit have a saying. They will do to cross the desert with. which really means, I'd trust them with my life. Let's, you and I, cross the desert together.\n\n<Placeholder. Replace with RST 13580>
Not much. Vandacia and his guards brought him in. It was unusual, though. The man was calm, confident. Completely at ease. Not a hint of worry or concern. Like the rabbit that knows it is faster than the wolf.\n\nI suggest you be careful with that one.
The frog pool. It's a bit farther into the ruins. It's where I saw Sister of Pools change my brother into a pig.\n\nWhen we get there, splash some water on Deet-Loh until he starts singing. This has to work.
Of course not! She was intended to be betrothed to the House Father's first-born, not some tenth-rate House Cousin she fetched trinkets for. With a word she could have elevated our station to the Great Houses.\n\nI ask so little, and she delivers less.
It was a singular find. The greatest in my career. A Dwemer puzzle box of such complexity and beauty that it could only truly be appreciated by a great mind. Onimiril understood that. We knew that this device hid answers to mysteries only they knew.
Anyone who knew that device's true value would never let it go. He'd never part with it willingly, no matter how much its maddening design might thwart him. My only consolation is my certainty that the puzzle has tormented him ever since he stole it.
Sombren doesn't think so. He says that's the last place they'd look for us.\n\nI'm still attuned to the realm from the trial in the Ashen Forest. Sombren believes he'll have enough time to teach me if I'm not in danger of imminently exploding.
Another waking vision! Happened when I got here. I think that strange book is trying to tell me something.\n\nI saw these weird cubes with symbols on them. Symbols like the ones in the book I'm carrying. I'm not sure what it all means.
He has grown distant lately. Meeting in secret with other mages, disappearing for days at a time. There is something troubling him that he does not want his egg-siblings to know about.\n\nBut I believe he might have told Melyn Drad.
It is mine.\n\nThough I will return to the Hist upon my death, I want all the stories I have collected in this life to have their place … to be remembered. I carry this with me to add to it as I travel.
No. You're not an Ambition. Besides, you've been to the Deadlands already and suffered no ill effects.\n\nIf the twins attempted that before we attune them, the plane would rip them apart. Our power, it's connected to Mehrunes Dagon in some way.
I'm not entirely sure. I just know that there's some element of Mehrunes Dagon inside us. And it wants to return whence it came. I think that's what Vandacia hoped to accomplish by killing me.\n\nAnyway, I'd rather not see that happen. To any of us.
I bet knowing an outsider has saved the day will truly tug his tail. We often argued until the night-bugs slept about the risks of isolating the tribe.\n\nBut, I feel sun-blessed that he survived. I would not change a thing.
Not only that, I'm the best scribe south of Skyrim! I arrived as quickly as I could, but I was too late to do more than glance at the coded documents. You should hurry, though. Vandacia went after Councilor Lovidicus and he had murder in his eyes.
Please. I'm sure Stibbons is just dithering about somewhere in the xanmeer without a care in the world. Any excuse to get out of a day's work.\n\nHe is by far the laziest, most infuriating manservant in all of Tamriel!
Helping. Is that so hard to believe? Not out of the goodness of my heart, of course. The priest was in possession of something I need until the Knights of the Silver Rose robbed it from him. We've come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Let me see the documents you found. \n\nI am familiar with nymics, but not with this egonymic. If it truly has the power to banish Mehrunes Dagon, then no wonder the Longhouse Emperors kept it hidden. And did you visit the doomvault mentioned here?
I have a talent. That's not just some excuse to brag. I was selected because I have the potential to make a difference in this crazy world. It's my duty to use it to restore the stability of the Empire. A return to peace.
Ah, you must be another one of the Dread Lady's followers. I've had a number of pleasant conversations with her prophet, Rogatina. And I even got to meet the Dread Lady once. She mentioned she might have need of such a tincture, so I brewed one up.
Of course. Wheels within wheels and all that. After you drink the potion and disguise yourself as a Waking Flame cultist, I will pretend to be your prisoner.\n\nNot only are you returning with the portal key, you're bringing them a gift. Me.
A remarkable achievement, devastator. And fortunate, as well. We're about to perform another test with the Fargrave cataclyst, and Nokvroz is hesitant to provide me with any more of his precious Daedra.\n\nLyranth should do very nicely.
At one of the work areas nearby, use string to bundle the feathers together into the likeness of the Crowborne Horror. \n\nOnce you douse the effigy in a brazier, it will imbue it with energy from the Evergloam and lure the creature to us.
Certainly not. Nokvroz was attempting to figure out how to build his own cataclyst, you do recall? But we should strike at the Waking Flame while it is in disarray. Find their hidden stronghold, learn what I require, and then do what you must.
That would be an inefficient use of my time and abilities.\n\nDo not expect me to guard you, mortal. But if you die, as mortals are prone to do, I shall inform Lyranth. At my convenience.
My Kyn learned little that we did not already know. They waited here, hoping to trail a Waking Flame messenger back to Sister Celdina. Since they are not here, it must have worked.\n\nWhich leaves us no closer to finding this mortal device. Or my Kyn.
As much as you trust me. If his Bladebearers come to grief at the hands of the Dagonists or Valkynaz Nokvroz, then you share a common enemy. Remind him of that.\n\nA temporary alliance with the enemy of his enemy? That Rynkyus can understand.
Vaveli Indavel represents the Saraathu Tong, a syndicate of outcast mages who control a lot of trade in the city.\n\nBetween their business dealings and research projects, they require groups to take on jobs too dangerous for single adventurers.
We know it's hunting prey. And it's falling apart without that. So we need to find and destroy that orb. Stop its ability to hunt and starve it to death. Perhaps I can watch it suffer.\n\nLead on. We're not leaving until the Ravener is dead.
No. Nokvroz is no mage. He must have found some relic or forgotten curse to transform me into this daedrat body. And he must have caught me off-guard. Otherwise, I would have destroyed him the moment he struck at me.
Not at all, but the attempt will be glorious!\n\nI mean, of course, master. It will be difficult, but I will be there to assist you. Right up until the very end.
That will be up to the mages of the Spire Council. We don't have the resources to guard this place from further incursions. They may devise a means of cleansing the lingering energies here, or simply decide to blast it into dust. It won't be missed.
You try to interpret Daedric actions through mortal understanding. I have seen the mortals of Wretched Spire do the same thing. It leads to all sorts of trouble.\n\nNokvroz will seek to discredit and undermine Celdina, even as he works to assist her.
What else would you call the Bladebearers' action? While they draw the attention of Nokvroz's forces, you must move quickly. You have until the last Bladebearer falls. Use that time wisely.\n\nAnd I do hope you survive. For aesthetics, if nothing else.
If that portal leads to wherever the cataclyst waits, then Elegian spoke true. We will not know until we use it, however.\n\nI sense that the portal connects to Nirn. Moreover, it contains a ward meant specifically for me. I dare not step through.
Rynkyus and his Bladebearers will assault the front gate, drawing the attention of Valkynaz Nokvroz's forces. Meanwhile, we will infiltrate using the attuned portal key and attempt to remain undetected as we search the fortress for the Anchorite.
Did Nokvroz face me in open battle? Did he strike me down with his own strength and fervor? No! He resorted to a trickster's curse.\n\nHis actions revealed his fear, not his power. He has not earned his place at the head of Lord Dagon's armies.
We tracked our first group of missing Bladebearers to Kynmarcher Jynd's foundry. When Nokvroz gave our Kyn to the Waking Flame mortals, we followed them to Annihilarch's Summit. That's where Nokvroz's blood adepts captured us.
Is protecting Tamriel not a worthy enough interest?\n\nAh, too clever to believe that, are we? Fine. We plan to draw power from the Crowborne Horror once you lure it into the pocket realm. It is nothing that concerns you, child.
The furnace has two other discharge labrums connected to it. If we move the charged lucent you found to one of them, we'll need to find another lucent for the second. Once both are active, that should ignite the furnace.
That would accomplish nothing. The Dagonists are experts when it comes to disappearing into the shadows.\n\nSister Celdina will pay for her various insults soon enough. For now, see what she left behind when she fled.
Dislike? One must be familiar with something to dislike it. I am unfamiliar with your kind and not especially curious. You are simply … unimportant.\n\nI mean no insult. I am sure you are very important to you. As far as mortals are concerned.
Comfort is not a concept I give much thought to. It is something mortals seek, to protect them from fears and cares. Or so I have heard.\n\nDremora know little of fear, so the relative merits of being comfortable or uncomfortable are meaningless.
We are Bladebearers. All of the Kyn of my clan are pact-bound, one to another. The clan-pact unites us in purpose, attunes us to each other. I know my Kyn, and see what they wish me to see. Others do not.\n\nIt is a connection that cannot be broken.
Figures. Maybe it's silly, but I was hoping for a little reassurance that we didn't just unleash a new threat on the world directly after banishing another.\n\nI have a bad feeling about all of this. But there's not much we can do.
An alchemist I know has a supply. Aurien. You can find her at the outpost south of Bramblebeach.\n\nTell her the tincture is for me and give her some of those yellow rocks you mortals are so fond of. Then return back to me.
I cannot say. I must consider the balance of their crime of theft, their flight from the city and their voluntary surrender in accordance with the Strictures. \n\nI will deliver judgement once the measure of these events is fully comprehended.
I am not a prophet, mortal. Seeing the future is not among my many abilities. But the whorls and eddies of existence carry us together and apart in their courses. None can truly know when we will meet again.
What can I tell you that you can't already guess? The Dread Lady is a powerful Dremora. Perhaps the strongest of her kind. She has served Daedric Princes but now walks her own path. She possesses a burning curiosity, forever seeking more knowledge.
Good question. I have my memories back, no strange Ambition powers to speak of, and nothing riding on my shoulders. I could do anything.\n\nI think I'm going to stay close to Calia for a bit. Tamriel is new to both of us. We can navigate it together.
Ally, yes. Friend … not so sure. Like others of his kind, he considers himself the better of mortals such as ourselves. And he barely tolerates that Sister Celdina is in charge of this operation.\n\nSometimes I think he'd love to slaughter us all.
Indeed. My relic. When I learned that the cult wanted it, I decided to acquire it before they could. I covered my tracks, but apparently not well enough.
Did you not just hear me say it was intelligent? \n\nI don't know about Taupezu Azzida, but I've heard of Mantikora bartering with cultists. Bartering! Let's not be stupid enough to give it something it can gift to our enemies.
The Blood Pit is a prison for Daedra. That alone should tell you what you need to know. \n\nPut another way, entering the Blood Pit is easy. It's the leaving that's impossible.
Very well. Just make sure you're prepared to face a tempest of blades or the Grim Warden will chop you to chowder in an instant.
You've already begun the process just getting here. Light the braziers by the orange guardian stone and you'll have reactivated its arcane matrix. Once you've done that, I can revise the spell, but we'll get to that matter in a moment.
The Ebony Blade? Well, that's uh … you know, not really my area of expertise. Daedric artifacts, I mean.\n\nThen again, there is a small errand that needs doing. A personal matter, you see. You help me with that, and my memory might improve.
Then hopefully there are a few uncharged crystals lying about. In that case, we'll need a dynamus font to charge them. Why don't you search around?
An interesting question. Alas, I have no answer. But you're not the only newcomer to our fair city seeking such knowledge.\n\nMy eyes about town tell me that Lyranth the Dremora has come to Fargrave. She's in the Shambles, searching for Sister Celdina.
An apt description, if somewhat inaccurate. They do enforce Fargrave's laws, but in ways that won't always be comprehensible to the limits of mortal understanding.\n\nTry not to commit any crimes in front of them and they won't harass you. Probably.
A personal query? That will cost extra, my darling.\n\nI am a Mazken, what your kind commonly call a Dark Seducer. Unlike many of my brothers and sisters, I use my charms to beguile and entice for knowledge and profit. I have no interest in violence.
Ravam probably will go on and on about the scarcity of resources here, but I suspect the real reason he's so insistent in getting his hands on some Daedric armor and weaponry is that he's been trying to learn Daedric techniques for a while now.
Bah. I did not do it for you or the Anchorite, master. I did it because it offered my best chance for vengeance.\n\nHad I chosen the safe course, Nokvroz would have been beyond my reach by the time Lyranth found a way to break the curse permanently.
Is there some benefit mortals derive from casual queries? Curious. I have heard that mortals ask questions even when they know the answer.\n\nRynkyus will be with you. That is enough.
How could it have been? Destron's dead. We both saw what happened to him. But even creating a copy … that was too cruel.\n\nI've already lost Destron once. I didn't need to see that again. And now I've lost Sombren. I just feel … empty.
The Anchorite has demonstrated the ability to survive whatever hardships come her way. She will sort out her memories and come to terms with her parentage, eventually.\n\nAnd she should be safe here in Fargrave. The Stricture will see to that.
So you have! And what do you know, a memory popped into my head just then!\n\nA couple Skaafin picked up the sword not long ago. Said they had to stow it away in the Hexos gallery vault. In the Shambles. Just don't tell anyone I told you, all right?
Redmaiden is a rare commodity, and difficult to produce. Mortals would tear each other apart for it if it was not strictly regulated. Not every mortal contracts the Drain. But many fear the very possibility, and will do anything to acquire the drug.
You found it? Then … no, I suppose I won't be able to change your mind. I don't deserve it anyway. It's my fault we got into this mess. I should be suffering. It's only fair.
Sister Celdina and the Waking Flame have attempted to neutralize me before. They warded this portal with a spell that will unravel my current body. Remember, I cannot die. Not like you. But I can be inconvenienced by the process of reformation.
I'm—I'm on a pilgrimage. There was some trouble, you see, and—ah, I shan't bore you with the details.
They are. Most of us mortals are all right. There are organizations who have pacts with powerful Daedra. But plenty of pactless mortals resort to a substance called Redmaiden to keep their wits. \n\nAnyone who can't stay on Redmaiden … well.
Good, good. Now, let me prepare your way to the realms beyond Nirn.
I can't believe …. Is that what you—what the Tribunal wants from me? \n\nMaybe it's better than letting two spirits stay in eternal agony. But, Sotha Sil? I don't know if I can do that. Not even for Ordinator Nilera and Grandmother Sovisa.
I've heard it sounds a lot like waking up bleary-eyed in a misty morning. Or like a hangover. \n\nAll I can say is that being killed is an annoyance and an indignity that most Daedra would rather not undergo.
No, they have never been so bold before. Perhaps they grew bored of petty theft and being a nuisance. I could not say. \n\nMany of their transgressions have been too small for the Grasp to interfere. Not this one.
Servant? It's a corpse, for Z'en's sake! It's not like it was polishing his silver and entertaining guests in the parlor. And it tried to eat me!\n\nI refuse to be punished for killing some feral creature that was already dead. How is this a crime?
Indeed. They will find it much less forgiving than Fargrave. If they manage to survive the lightning and the tearing winds, they will need to contend with the wildlife. The Sever is not a gentle place. \n\nBe cautious when you venture there.
Is it? I hadn't noticed.\n\nLook, we only just met. If you turn out to be trustworthy, I'll tell you the strange tale. If not … well, we'll deal with that if it becomes necessary.
Aww. Little mortal, are you curious? Do you want to know how I got myself tied up by a main road in Fargrave? Do you think you can solve my problems and set me free?
They won't work properly unless they're attuned. \n\nRight now, the stones couldn't return me to Morrowind. They need a lot of power to save Ordinator Nilera and Grandmother Sovisa. I mean, they're both dead and they've been trapped here for years.
She was protecting the Temple from Mehrunes Dagon's attack a few years ago. I remember hearing her call him a Sar-shemand fetcher. It was the most heroic thing I've ever heard. \n\nI cried when her screams stopped.
The mortal cultists inflicted no lasting harm upon me, as you set me free before they sent me into the cataclyst. The indignity of being imprisoned by mortals, however, is not one I shall soon forget.
Oh, no! I'm just Vares's apprentice. But he's already taught me so much about spell-casting and magic, I know I'll be great with a bit more study.
While I may not like mortals, I've always found the events on Nirn to be fascinating. I loved getting summoned by mortal wizards. Oh, not because I like serving them. No, because I could often trick them and then wander off and explore for a time.
Chopping wood, or trading for it, Zenithar equates such labor as the same as any heroic act.\n\nWe who serve Zenithar know that he respects the dirt under your fingernails as much as the offerings burnt in his name.
They were recruiting, or at least offering the chance to earn a reward. They wanted people ready to haul in whatever came ashore.\n\nSeveral salvagers went with them. I wouldn't, though. What I find is mine.
A sailor in Gonfalon Bay described them as creatures of molten rock. She said vulk'esh shed their outside layer of rock, like a snake. There's bound to be piles of scoria lying around for us to take. But Tarrinore went in on her own.
First thing, Privette needs a bath! She seems a little sad at the moment. But a long soak should fix that. Then I'll make us a meal. The simple pleasures.\n\nI just want her to feel safe again.
No, we need to return to Lady Arabelle and share this information. Then we can mount a rescue for Guild General Quentyn.\n\nI'll meet you at Lady Arabelle's little pavilion. What she calls her field office, I believe.
The Ancient Anchor Inn sits just up the street near the city gate. It's one of the more popular places on the island. In my experience, inns are an excellent location to pick up rumors.
And I'm looking for a posting more interesting than pushing papers for Knight Commander Jourvel, or playing politics with snooty nobles!\n\nTell me, why should I give a key to the first peasant who comes wandering in off the lawn?
Gross. All right, since it's for Isobel. I'm sure it's yet another ode to my hair or face or something. \n\nTell him I blushed prettily and said I would read it later, when I'm alone. Good luck.
One should be careful when talking about one's neighbors. Still, Count Mornard's dislike of my family is well known. Years ago, his father backed King Ranser of Shornhelm in his dispute with High King Emeric.\n\nEmeric did not forget it.
I lived there for most of my life. I have many happy memories there but a good deal of unhappy ones too. I used to have a crew there, a good one. Me and three others. We were just kids, but we did pretty well for ourselves.
I was not the only one with a difficult life, nor will I be the last. But it's all right, it was all I knew. I wasn't bemoaning my fate or lack of a permanent roof over my head all the time. I had a lot of freedom at least.
That's horrible! No wonder I noticed traces of vampirism! Yes, Vampire blood can speed recovery, but it's very risky. I know Viralaine thought our methods were slow, but still ….\n\nWe must confront him. Together, if Seraphyne's willing.
Of course I'll help. Anything to bring that monster down. Even if it means allowing others to see what I am.
We will assume power and put an end to this wretched war. Strength can win the peace Lord Bacaro hopes for. Hard choices must be made, but one day the peoples of Tamriel will thank us.  \n\nA pity you are too blind to see this simple truth.
No need to get violent about it. Fine. I helped Valentyn sneak out of the stockade and into the caldera just before you got here. Said he needed to check something past the big tree and near where the waterfall plunges down.\n\nNow leave me be.
I was? What manner of unseemly laze-about was he? No, no, don't tell me, I don't want to spare a moment more of thought on him. Not when I can devote my attentions to the work ahead of me. \n\nWe have an offering to prepare.
I hoped the legend was wrong. That I'd only need the one key I already have. But alas, it requires three keys to open the vault. And now I know where to find them. \n\nHelp me survive the jungle and acquire the other keys, and I'll pay you handsomely.
Heh. Most people were scared of Jhaka. He's a Pahmar, so everyone wrote him off as a big, dumb brute. But I've never met a kinder soul. He was always so generous, even though he didn't have a coin to his name. He was … spiritual, too.
That's probably for the best. It's close by. And All Flags Castle was quite a mess after the battle with the Ascendant Magus. It will take Lord Bacaro a considerable effort if he plans to make it ready for the conference again.
I really am. But you know me. I lay low and some sort of trouble still finds me. I'm like one of those lodestones, I guess.
Pahmar? What do you want with one of them? Eh, I don't care. Go ask the inn owner. \n\nI'm just supposed to tempt customers with our delicious food.
The gentleman I did business with told me that his band was headed to Pulk next. Here, I'll mark the location for you. \n\nThe man's name was Bralsa Inlador. And that, my friend, is all the information I have for you. Now kindly scurry off.
Info 2
Mount Firesong is the volcano that rises above the island of Y'ffelon. You can see it in the distance. It's always been restless, and its vents and hot springs stretch throughout the archipelago. \n\nI didn't think too much about the initial rumbles.
No idea, we peeled off from Kestrin's Blades before we ever made the trade. Things started falling apart after that job.\n\nBut if you want to find the Wood Elf, try the Shrine of the Black Maw. Bloodsuckers are still crawling all over that place.
Hmm. I was hoping father needed us to battle the Hadolids. Recovering bandages and poultices is just as important. Right? \n\nOoh! Maybe there'll be resonance crystals. I haven't sung into one of those for a while.
No idea who you are or what you are talking about. Leave me be!\n\nBack off, then follow me. Discreetly.
We regaled each other with tales of how we survived the shipwrecks and our adventures on Amenos.\n\nI believed Emeric was past his prime, no longer the great hero. And Irnskar struck me as young and brash. I now have a different perspective.
I'd tell you to mind your business, but you've done me a good turn.\n\nI wasn't always such an upstanding citizen. I got involved with some unscrupulous things around Port Hunding. It caught up with me and I found myself on Amenos soon enough.
Arrgh! Get. Out. Of. My. Head!
I missed your courage and your competence. Let's go cut some timber.
How do I feel? Like some virile man was stomping around inside my body with his oversized boots and manly urges. It was unsettling.\n\nAnd, if I'm being totally honest, somewhat arousing.
So Jakarn mentioned. Well done! I'm not sure how the Ascendant Order ascertained our plans, but at least you recovered the invitation medallions. They're the key, after all. Figuratively and literally.\n\nOh, that's good. I should write that down.
Just getting out into the fresh air is an improvement. That place was a nightmare. \n\nBrigands, Daedra, rats … I wasn't sure if I'd end up with a knife in my gut or eaten by Ogrim.
She was ill for some time, just a short while ago. Past it now, I'm sure. But she's such a vibrant force, on the battlefield or the stage.\n\nIt was a blow to see her barely able to swing a blade. Not like today, hah!
I've learned a lot from Dame Madach's … erm … unorthodox leadership approach. She firmly believes in pushing squires to better themselves. \n\nAs she likes to say, I'm not your captain, kid. Figure it out!
Heh, not being killed for some druid's evil plan or slaving in a mine will do that to you. Turns out not making extra work for the people just trying to keep you alive is a good idea.\n\nI'll have to remember that. Seems like it'll be useful later.
It wasn't always. It used to be one of the safest locations on the island. In fact, my ancestors deemed the grove sacred when they first arrived.\n\nNow the corrupted wildlife attacks for no reason, and some of my fellow druids have been afflicted.
Brahgas … yes, he loves the game in his way. I wish he exercised more caution. He often forgets how much he has to lose.\n\nBut he's a bright lad. Full of youthful energy and hope. That is more than I can say about most people in this world.
If they recognized us as delegates, there's all sorts of ways they could hold that over the conference. If they just assumed we were rich nobles, ransom is always an option.\n\nBut who can really say what those helmeted bastards are thinking?
I would be happy to!\n\nThe tournaments started informally. Premiere players like myself and Teliv Fels gathered in major cities to match wits and sharpen our game. The Roister's Club leadership caught wind of it and began sponsoring official events.
If luck is with us, maybe just some irritated wildlife we can deal with as we've done before. Or some of the bolder motes.\n\nBut if there is some truth to the ancient tales, then maybe we find some sort of really cranky wind spirit.
Well, between you, me, and old Bendu there, I've heard they might offer some new decks as prizes in the upcoming tournaments. Beyond that? It's a mystery.\n\nJust keep working on raising that rank by playing matches. That's the best path to success!
Had being the operative word. Clearly, her best days are behind her. I cannot fathom her methods. The delegates are lost, so what's the point of distressing the duchess's guests with incessant questions?\n\nBesides, we have the situation well in hand.
I am a druid of the Stonelore Circle. I am a teacher, a healer, a counselor—as well as a steward of the natural world.\n\nI hear the voice of Y'ffre and his Earthbones, and I do my best to be his advocate. Natural principles guide my every action.
Chizbari, Sidura and the rest stayed behind in Senchal. Because of the secrecy, they gave us royal agents to crew the Pounce.\n\nI'm not sure there are any other survivors to find. I didn't see anyone else make it to shore.
She said what now? Rotmeth? Hemgruuf smells bad, but not that bad!\n\nTime to deliver the ouchy-ouchies! Out of my way, friend!
I can give a firsthand report. The first symptom is the nightmares. I'm familiar with dreams of war, but these were somehow more horrible.\n\nI remember eyes around me, peering from darkness. And screaming. Constant screaming.
Hmm. Strange that this affliction shows up at the same time people start disappearing. I don't believe in coincidences.\n\nWhy didn't Viralaine tell me about this? Sure, I'm not a member of the Society, but still …. Anything else?
She's the moony Khajiit downstairs. Kishka and her brother create daily challenges for the chapter to keep us sharp. It's great practice and you can win some fine rewards, too!\n\nKeeping her attention's no small feat, but when she focuses, look out!
Me? I'm calm as a slug on Sundas! I don't let these things get to me. Tribute is meant to be fun! My days in Elsweyr taught me that there's far worse things to get upset over. Far, far worse.\n\nJust enjoy yourself! Let Brahgas handle the stress.
Since I opted to travel with you, I'm considered a Knight-Errant. A wanderer, basically. \n\nJust trying to make the world a better place one act at a time. Like you.
Ah, my trusty hammer and chisel! Saved my arse on more than one occasion!\n\nNow let's go find that gem and get to the extraction point before Marcelle. If we hurry, we can still turn the tide on the love of my life.
I don't know much else, only that he has a sort of animalistic presence. Nothing obvious, but hunters recognize the way he stalks through the markets. \n\nDon't underestimate him. Zenithar smiles on those whose work is well-reasoned.
Without the relic, my family will struggle and scrounge to maintain their power. Over time, their wealth will dwindle and they will be lost, I'm sure. \n\nWith my father gone, there is no one to lead the Emerald Eye. I imagine it will dissolve in time.
Nothing that bad. We were sitting at a table with my parents, eating the food I grew up on. Calia tried not to look sick when I explained what was in each dish. It was a good dream!\n\nWherever those two are, I think they're having a good time.
Oh, that was early in the First Era. After struggling against the Direnni Hegemony, our ancestors came to this archipelago because of its connection to Y'ffre. When they arrived, our druidic circle deemed Stonelore Grove to be a sacred site.
I'm not quite certain. Lord Bacaro's plans are in disarray. We were stranded on Amenos and assaulted in his supposedly secure facility. Makes one wonder if all this talk of peace is actually worth the effort.
Exactly. Which is one of the reasons I'm laying low and talking to all the wonderfully boring people here. I'll be in Mournhold again soon, but I want to give the Living Gods a chance to find new hobbies.
Of course, of course! I commend your efforts. Please let the rest of the order know that I, Sir Brenvale the Golden, shall now depart this plane at last.\n\nMy next performance will be in the great theatres of Aetherius! Adieu!
That's the spirit! I've had it up to my acorns with all the pity. Poor, pathetic Brahgas! Sure, I've stumbled in the past, but this is my ticket to a clean slate!\n\nCome on. Let's head back to the gaming hall and meet our soon-to-be-defeated foes!
Ah, yes. The protected hall. I thought Lady Arabelle's arrangements were overly cautious. Events, however, reveal the wisdom of her actions. As much as I dislike hiding, we must deny our enemies an easy victory.\n\nDo you have an invitation medallion?
Brahgas's debts are … no longer in Brahgas's hands. There is hope still, but you must defeat Teliv in order for my plan to work. And to defeat Teliv, you must beat Brahgas here. Now.\n\nHe's upstairs waiting. HoonDing give you strength.
Ah yes, there's a cave on High Isle which is filled with roving packs of vulk'esh. The creatures are so great that their footsteps shake the earth. \n\nI stood atop the mountain and felt the blistering heat on my face. No mortal could survive there.
Find a weak spot and knock on the wall. You'd be surprised what you can do with a good hammer and chisel.\n\nI'd do it, but I'm more about the strategy and tactics than the physical labor. Not really built for that sort of thing, you know.
It's not really my area of expertise, but I presume you just hit it until it stops moving. And given the fact that the Sable Knight animates the bodies of its victims with necromantic power, I'd appreciate it if you didn't join its little army.
Ah, enough of all the mushy stuff. You should head upstairs and talk to Razhamad. He's got a reward for you. Go claim it, champ!\n\nAs for me? I'm going to have a bit more of this delicious medicine.
Razhamad revoked my chapter sponsorship and suspended my Roister's Club membership—we've barely spoken since we got back.\n\nLooks like my days on the Tribute circuit are over. After what I put Razhamad through, I can hardly blame him.
Oh, by all the stars! Why must that ghost make this difficult? Amunara didn't even know he'd be here! Who sticks around after they die to give people tests?\n\nThis one sympathizes, but when Amunara leaves, the shield goes with her.
An evil knight you say? You know, that just might be odd enough to work. My knight master will probably spend the entire trip challenging the other knights we meet along the road. But, what else is new?\n\nI'll tell him about this villain right away.
Well, that's great news! People in my condition struggle to find opponents. Most of the tournaments take place during the day. And Verandis's band of orphans? Well, they all stink.\n\nI helped craft the damned game, but I barely get a chance to play!
Eh. On second thought? No. I'm tired of bleeding novices dry. I'm sure you're a fine player. But, I need a real challenge. And as you can see, I've got nothing but time.\n\nCome back when you've got a title under your belt.
Aye. Taleria has split her fleet into small attack groups to hit as many shipping lanes as she can. We've tried to catch them out in smaller numbers, but their groups maneuver in perfect concert with each other.
Kiv and I have kinda been … flirting with the idea of doing business for a while. And then I get a letter from him saying he's working with the Veloise Mercantile. So I say, sign me up!
Some backwater called Northsalt. Never heard of it before. These merchants blow where the winds take them, you know?\n\nHey, be careful in Rivenspire. I've heard dark shadows hang over that part of the world.
Exceedingly well. With the trials out of the way, the jousting and revelry has been some of the best we've ever seen. \n\nI rarely get a chance to enjoy much of it, but Aurelia has encouraged me to live a little.
Oh, very good! Tanillin and Ulgonash said my diplomacy was so strong they didn't need to be diplomacized any more. They told me I could go commit diplomacy on new people and make more friends!
Who knows what dangers lurk in this old ruin? And Amunara refuses to deal with this trial nonsense. The mercenaries will help me break through into the Shield Hall.\n\nLook, be reasonable. Move on and no one will know. Now, this one has work to do.
The Trial of Constitution will test your hardiness in one of the castle's old training grounds. You can expect to be assailed by dangerous traps and snares.\n\nNo challenger has completed this trial since I walked among the living.
It appears Dwarven and unusually simple for their work. It seems to react to magical energies, but the interference from Taleria's runes make its output too chaotic for me to understand.\n\nThose runes must be destroyed if I'm to learn more.
I already located and destroyed two. When I did, the tonal output of this device increased, but I sense the presence of more interference coming from outside this chamber. I'd wager there are about five more runes, if they are of similar potency.
Yes! I started by singing rats off of a galley. It's a small start, but now folks are coming to me with their problems!\n\nI'm making a name for myself. It might not be much—yet—but I crafted it myself. And it's my name, not my father's.
Of course!\n\nThe tournaments provided the lift you needed to reach master status, but you are still far from the summit. Searching for new cards, playing ranked matches with high-level players … maybe even seeking the Founders.
When you play games of luck and skill, you meet many people. Some are prudent. Some are not. Unfortunately, the imprudent players tend to remain that way. Unless they seek help.\n\nIf Brahgas finds help, he may turn things around. I hope he does.
Stranger things have happened. My uncle used to dance naked through the grahts hunting shalks with a deer-antler. Now he sells pottery in Pellitine. Things change.\n\nAs much as I complain about it, I do love this city. So, yeah. It might just stick.
Yes, yes! One day Rigurt was drinking in the Skald-King's hall and loudly explaining all the good things people don't know about Nords. King Jorunn said he knew that already and I should go tell somebody else.\n\nSo I did!
Maybe the game at Whalefall isn't for the prisoners. Maybe it's for rich highborn monsters to hunt down desperate people.\n\nWhen you have enough gold, you can do pretty much whatever you want.
It was my old, worn gardening shirt. I like to give used cloth to the seamstress in town. She makes patches. But she's old and it hurts her to cut cloth. So, I cut it before donating.\n\nPrivette saved me the trouble. She's great!
You're right! I got cause to celebrate. Let's find another! More liquor for me!
Absolutely. They raised a storm and sank three ships to try to kill us. As long as their leaders live, there's no reason to expect them to just surrender.\n\nAt least Emeric, Irnskar, and I still draw breath. Thanks to you.
It's a wonderful story! A mutual enthusiasm for libations, two brilliant minds, two fates intertwined, a love so passionate it threatens to engulf all of Tamriel as we bring drinks to the thirsty and curious! It's … wait, what are we talking about?
I suppose you are correct. I've heard rumors of entire clans turning against their more bloodthirsty brethren.\n\nThat said … I would not advise relying on a vampire's charity. They cannot be trusted.
Goodness, no! That honor falls to my cousin Leonard, and he can have it! I wouldn't want the responsibility.\n\nNo, I'm content managing our affairs here on High Isle. I leave the larger concerns of the business and house to my cousin, the count.
You jest, right?\n\nKishka seems like a silly ja'khajiit, yes, but when she gets angry? Ziss'vo. She is like little Merrunz—all hissing and flailing and biting. You would be scared too, I think!
He won't be happy about the way Lord Bacaro manipulated him. But when I explain what happened here—and what you did, friend—he'll support my decision. He really is an excellent king, my father. But don't tell him I said that.
I wouldn't say that. I came here to do a job, and I think it can still be done. I plan to send word to the Skald-King, tell him I'm staying—at least as long as Emeric and Ayrenn agree. Lord Bacaro may have deceived us, but peace is still possible.
Yeah. And I have no idea why. Aldvar doesn't offer much to her. No real strength in herbalism or alchemy that I've seen.\n\nI might be too hard on him. He does get along well with all the patients. Perhaps Roslenn has a soft spot for the mediocre.
Lady Garick called it her Sacred Shield. She claimed that a saint of Arkay blessed it with his blood. While she held it, no injury could befall her.\n\nI have no reason to doubt this belief. Only when she left it behind did she die in battle.
The rush to earn the shield slowed to a trickle. I think people started to believe the task was impossible. Eventually, they stopped all together.\n\nBut I stayed at my post! Lady Garick gave me an order, and I refused to shirk it. Even after I died.
Oh, I met my end as an old man. While cleaning cobwebs off one of the traps, I felt a pain in my chest. Then, just darkness.\n\nI woke up above my body. Quite the shock, I'll say. But it made sense. From there I just … kept to my routine.

Parts of it. But we have a rich history and the same sorts of dangers you'd experience on the mainland. Bandits, pirates, wild beasts. \n\nAnd you might want to avoid our sister island, Amenos. It's a harsh jungle that has long served as a prison.
Because the Ascendant Magus has made a show of wanting us to fear him. Why would he care if he had what he wanted and couldn't be stopped? No, the royals elude him. Somehow.\n\nBut his magic … I wonder ….
<Placeholder. Will be replaced with RST 15796>
I'd like to sift through these documents. Maybe some lost sailor found the secret to Graven Deep.\n\nAnd who knows? Perhaps information about the Druid King will float to the surface. A long bet, I know. But I feel in my bones that something's here.
The note was suspiciously vague about that. If I hadn't been tired and thinking about twelve dozen other things, that should have set off a warning bell. Instead ….\n\nNo matter. Tell me, is Lord Bacaro ready to start the peace talks?
We know that the Ascendant Lord allied with factions of the Eldertide and Firesong Circles, but to actively promote a sacred druidic prophecy to gain followers to his cause ….\n\nWhat about those crates we found?
The high-roller suite, they call it the patrician suite, is for game winners only. This is where you come in. Raz has an idea. \n\nOne of the games they play is Tales of Tribute. Are you familiar with this card game?
Now? Now we do exactly what Lady Arabelle would want us to. We follow the clues.\n\nHead to Steadfast Manor. We need to talk to Captain Marguerite. I'll meet you there after I start the preparations for the antidote.
What? But Lord Bacaro is a man of peace. Why secretly control the very order of rogue knights that are actively trying to destroy everything he's worked for? I don't understand.
It's an initiative this one began to properly train fighters to face down the Dragons plaguing Elsweyr. Without leaving behind heaps of charred bodies, of course.\n\nYou'd be surprised how poorly some of the recent battles have gone.
Roneiia was a legend among the Eyes of the Queen, five-claw. If she does not want to be found, we have a better chance of sniffing out a sweetroll in a tannery.\n\nLet's look through Grandvache's documents. They may give us a place to start.
The Ascendant Order? The rogue knights that gave you trouble back on High Isle? What would they be seeking in my castle?
At the docks preparing to receive Lord Bacaro's ship and the relief supplies he promised. It never arrived. I suppose that was all part of the ruse, based on what you just told me.\n\nNow let's go make sure the crown is still safely locked away.
Correct again!\n\nTruly, you are a learned scholar of Dragon lore. I will let Captain Samara know you've proven yourself twice over in the trial of knowledge. Well done!
This one was born here in Elsweyr, but spent many years traveling Tamriel as a mercenary. When I received word about Dragons terrorizing my home, I could not sit idly by. This one had to return.
Oh, that doesn't matter. As long as I bring them proof that it's worth their effort to establish a new mine, then everyone will be happy.\n\nAnd then maybe next time, House Mornard will hire me directly instead of going through agents and brokers.
Some of them. But when Dhulef wrote that he spotted more of them here on the mainland ….\n\nI don't know what changed, but the Firesongs went from the most isolated circle to the most violent faster than a tree sheds leaves in the autumn chill.
Until today, I would have said Suncleft Cove wasn't important at all. It's a pretty enough spot, but there are certainly better places for the Dreadsails to land raiders. I can't imagine what the Sea Elves want there.\n\nIs that all?
I dropped the tablet. Slipped right through the fingers I no longer have. I broke it. And if Joslin hadn't tried to help me, I'd be the only one cursed. \n\nBut maybe Druid Fenas will save us. Druid Fenas … and you. Let's head back to Fauns' Thicket.
Hmm. One of our druids was captured in the attack on Tuinh. I've had scouts searching all over for her, and they tracked the Dreadsails to Castle Tonnere. It's a ruined keep on Galen's northwest shore.
The sacred seeds were given into the care of the three Druid Circles by Druid King Kasorayn, to keep and guard until the time they would be needed. That's what the prophecy says, but the actual meaning has been debated for centuries.
Not easily. This lock has some sort of arcane reinforcement—you won't be able to pick it. We need the gaoler's key.\n\nHe's a fearsome brute called Goriadh. His chambers are across the hall to the east. That's how he comes and goes, at least.
Quen? Job? That can wait, lovely.\n\nI'm quite thirsty. Could you bring the water bucket? You wore me out.
Key! Key! Time for riddle three! \n\nThe sun-warmed side of Singer's path is where you'll find your prize. Hang Gloomlantern upon your ship to shroud her from all eyes!
For all my time studying the history of Druid King Kasorayn, that's been one of my primary questions. Is the Ivy Throne a metaphor? Is there an actual throne, like the one High King Emeric sits upon? We just don't know for sure.
These troubled times confuse even me, my friend.\n\nVerline is my closest counselor. A loyal Firesong, all too familiar with the threat posed by those sworn to the Allwither. He is in danger, too, from those who call him a traitor to their cause.
To sow confusion and weaken House Dufort, of course. And to further delay the peace talks. Perhaps even scuttle them completely. I have political rivals, but none who would stoop to murder.\n\nIf I had to guess? This is the work of the Ascendant Order.
Hmm. That sounds like the Ascendant Order. But only a skilled druid could alter plants and create this vile poison. We know they worked with the Eldertide Circle before. Maybe they still have some druid allies assisting them?
Besides the Firesong druids, the very air is thick with spirit motes. You'll see them once we enter the valley.\n\nThe worst are the animals though. They frighten me.
We'll rebuild. Ask more Eldertide to join us. For too long, we relied on the Chronicle to show us our past. To tell us our stories. It's time for us to take responsibility for our own memories, I think.
Captain Marguerite's reputation is impeccable and she seemed unaware of all this. But the same could be said about Lord Bacaro.\n\nUntil we determine how far this corruption has spread into the Society of the Steadfast, we keep this to ourselves.
I plan to hire Captain Siravaen's ship. The Mad Maiden is anchored just outside Vastyr's walls, and she has no love for the Firesong druids. \n\nHer ship and crew are battle tested. They'll be perfect for what we need to do.
Give one seed to each druid circle to guard … to keep. Oak to Eldertide. Rowan to Stonelore. Ash … for the Firesong untainted by the Allwither.\n\nOne last thing … go to the Ivy Throne. Seal it. No one must enter until the Sower awakens.
Vaster, wind-wracked shores … that sounds like Vastyr and Windwrack Fort to me. And the riddle makes mention of the distant cauldron.\n\nMaybe … somewhere on the shore between Vastyr and Windwrack Fort, within sight of Y'ffelon?
The Firesong Circle sailed off with at least three good Dreadsail warships. I doubt those oyster-shuckers know how to handle them, but they're out there somewhere. Plus whatever scows they use to get from island to island.\n\nMight be rough seas ahead.
Ah, thank you. We're shorthanded and I haven't had anyone to send for these. As you can see, the fighting on Galen has caused no end of suffering. And most of the victims are simple farmers and townsfolk, not soldiers.\n\nDamn those Sea Elf pirates!
Remember how I mentioned that shipwreck years ago. When the Stonelore druids rescued me and took me in. Taught me to see the world in a new way. That was here on Galen.\n\nI set aside my cutlass for magic, but lately I've needed both blade and staff.
Count Mornard sent word to the Mages Guild that he wanted to hire a battlemage. I was already here, so the guild sent me. Not the first time I've sold my sword. Or my staff.\n\nI advise the count and get my hands dirty when I need to.
We've never faced such a test, but Vastyr's walls are built to withstand punishment. I believe they'll hold and give us the time we need to drive off the invaders. But even the strongest stone can be chipped away at with enough effort.
Rock. Root. Leaf. Brook. All dreams of the Green. My kin, spirits given form. We are … purpose. Meaning. \n\nNow, a new purpose grows. Unwelcome change.
The Stonelore reported glimpses of someone fitting his description lurking near Glimmertarn on the north side of Galen.\n\nHe's sneaky enough to not be seen, but he feeds off of fear. Best take care of him before he decides to kill again.
Yes, long ago. It was a … sanctuary. Lost to time. But it held answers, the truths of me. The longer I stayed, the more I learned … remembered. \n\nMy hands alone can ordain. I grow the seeds.
Possibly. But more to the point, I want you to warn Count Stefan and secure the aid of House Mornard. Sail to Vastyr and meet with the count. Let him know what transpired here and get him to agree to aid us when the order appears again.
I certainly hope not. We're still recovering from the Dreadsails raid, not to mention Archdruid Orlaith's attempt to become a new druid king. Lord Bacaro sent the Society of the Steadfast to provide aid and support, and we appreciate the help.
Despite Lord Bacaro's betrayal, the society has done good work here in the Systres and back in Tamriel. I'd hate to lose that, but you're quite correct. I need to determine if the society is trustworthy.
What? Oh, yes. Of course. I'll be fine. Just got a bit caught up in the moment. Moments. Lots of moments. \n\nQuen seems a bit, ah, disappointed in this particular heist. But I'll remember it forever. She's probably just a little jealous.
I hoped I could count on Archdruid Rahval, but it's good to hear those words. Even with the secret paths, though, it was difficult avoiding our enemies. The wilderness is thick with Dreadsails and Firesong.\n\nI assume you helped settle things here?
I know what you're thinking. How did a Wood Elf become a Stonelore druid? I wasn't satisfied with just following the Green Pact. It wasn't enough. So I came to Galen to find myself. Turns out, I fell right in with the Stonelore Circle.
Orlaith murdered Archdruid Rahval during the Dreadsails attack on Vastyr. And Count Mornard and Archdruid Ellic were buried under the city's cathedral when it collapsed.\n\nAt least you killed Sealord Nalos. The Dreadsails aren't a threat anymore.
This one is normally happy to chit and chat, but some things must remain secret for the safety of all. \n\nSuffice to say, the queen's arrival in the archipelago may signal a new chapter in the story of the world. Fingers crossed and tail in knots.
Raz hopes so, five-claw. Most folk believe the treasure was just a story, anyway. And if anyone follows hints from Vastyr to the caves, well. They'll have to dig out a mountainside for even a handful of coins.\n\nIn this one's opinion, a job well done.
Oh, come now. I don't wish to quarrel. It's just that my methods are highly efficient. I've managed to blend in quite well here, for many years, all on my own. \n\nCouldn't you sail over to Amenos and sate yourself on the wretches there?
Excellent! Oh, you won't regret this. And enjoy the slightly elevated view while you can!
Healers, supplies—everything the Society of the Steadfast is known for. I need to coordinate efforts and stock the ships, but our pavilions will spring up before you know it.\n\nAnd when I return, I look forward to working closely with Count Stefan.
Trust has to start somewhere. But we still need to gather the elders and form a new Draoife. After that, I'll broach the subject.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll commune with the tree. With the growing seeds. And I'll be here when they finally blossom.
What choice do we have? Our stories and history are important, perhaps now more than ever. If my understanding of recent events is true, then you know the dangers of burying or misinterpreting the past.\n\nHistory should be learned from, not repeated.
All right, I've taken up enough of your time. I know how eager Lady Arabelle is to get the peace talks underway.\n\nWe'll talk later. Now go speak to Lady Arabelle and let her know everything is ready for her to begin.

But you're different?
So your ancestors just gave up?
You were the Wilderking's first creations and his most beloved.
You're welcome.
And that's what you intended to do with the Altmer you robbed?
Why do you have a grudge against the Altmer?
Are the Colovians still causing trouble?
Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?
Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?
How do we capture the enemy's Elder Scrolls?
What do I need to do?
Was he successful?
What if we send the guilds to Coldharbour?
Send the guilds into Coldharbour.
Do we have a choice? I don't see any other options.
Are they feuding?
What are you?
What can you tell me about this game?
How can the links be broken?
Why are the Elder Scrolls kept in temples?
I'll return as soon as I can.
Why should I trust you?
Why stay?
What can you tell me about Hectahame?
What then?
What do you mean by practical applications? What do you need me to do?
Let's go to Driladan Pass.
I'll defend you.
How do I hand skulls to a ghost?
What comes next?
After you, Khali.
Actually, I'd like to hear your thoughts on <<1>> the merchant.
So, what's our next move?
Yes, I'm ready.
What is the Moon Hallowed?
Shouldn't a prince be afforded a little more respect?
I wish to join the Mages Guild, then.
Thank you.
So you act as bookhunters?
You mentioned an Argonian?
Thank you.
A history lesson?
What are you suggesting?
What's the reward?
And where should I look for your Badge of Office?
Where can I find Tharlas and Jonne?
I have a lizard that can track the scent.
I think you should own the johads.
And then what?
What did they do?
Someone has to die?
Where am I supposed to go?
What can you tell me about <<1>>?
I wish you luck.
This will be dangerous, right?
Of course not.
How long have you been a skeleton?
What's a spinner?
You can tell the future?
Jealousy?
How about Warfront missions?
<Place <<Az:1>>.>
What's so special about the Barrowbough?
I am.
Thank you, Merric.
I'm here to defeat him and take my soul back.
Can he really sense <<1>>?
Will your people be all right in Valenwood?
Can you tell me more about <<1>>?
I wield a longsword.
That's why we have to win here.
How did you two hear about this village?
Are you insane?
I'll see what I can do.
What have you done since the attacks began?
Who are you?
How would I do that?
So what can you tell me about Sea Vipers?
What does <<1>> have to do with this?
You're not alone. I'm here.
What if I found your scouts?
What do you mean?
Why is Montclair on the rampage?
Thanks.
I'm glad you are doing so well.
Did you find this relic?
Have you found anything interesting?
Why not portal me into the Mages Guild in Evermore?
Where is Sancre Tor located?
He was afraid <<1>> would wake up.
I'm here to support you, Your Majesty.
Thank you for the information.
Did we succeed? Is Tamriel safe?
I'll have to report this to the queen.
Elara seems to be cured. What more is left to do?
Why did you kill Sir Etienne? You had already treated his injuries, you could have let him go.
Would you doom this girl to die for a grudge against the Sentinel?
I understand your frustration, but lives are at stake.
Aren't you concerned about the killing in the streets?
I'll tell him what you've said.
What will you do now?
So you have the poultices?
<Give him a package of <<1>>.>
Why do you live in these woods?
What was Saryne's role?
Don't do this, Lyris. There must be another way.
Really?
Is Montclair that vessel?
How do we get in?
I want to become a member of the Mages Guild.
Care to elaborate?
She's writing about bloodfiends. If hunters know the difference, vampires would be safer.
Why is this all so critical? Is this thing that dangerous?
That can't be a popular decision.
How can I forget Hectahame?
You're right. We need to remain focused.
This is a local rebellion. Why should I get involved?
I think Queen Eselde will be an excellent ruler.
I think King Alard will be an excellent ruler.
Yes. I'll try to get his attention.
Is it true?
What might that be?
Sacrifice?
Cloudless skies scare the peepers away.
Once yellow, it grew jealous of its neighbors. I hear it stole the red skin.
How does this business opportunity work?
Will you show me where these bandits are so I can join them too?
What's the plan?
Where are the supplies?
But what do you need the inscriptions for?
What will you do next?
What do you suggest then?
Did you ever find the Amulet of Kings?
No. It's not safe. You should run.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
You're welcome.
Let's go.
What do these wards do?
If he puts them on trial, the king shows he doesn't fear the Blacksap. It makes him look stronger.
He hasn't racked up any more debt with S'rashi, has he?
What sacrifice did your mother make?
We also saw a projection of Sai Sahan. He spoke to us.
Your men won't get here fast enough to save your life.
No, I don't.
<Take the Sword of the Saint.>
<Take the Simple Training Sword.>
What's the plan once we're all inside?
All right, I'll follow you inside.
What can you tell me about House Montclair?
Where can I find him?
Here is an offering. Please begin.
I'll tell him.
Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild.
If you can't leave, how will you find any stories?
What if I retrieved your trunk?
I met your children when they were alive. This is how they were.
Summoning ritual?
These ruins were once a shrine?
If you're running from Daedra, isn't this a bad place to loiter around?
The other disciples made this sacrifice willingly too?
You say she's a mage?
What will become of your disciples?
What can you tell me about the temple?
Thank you.
<Use Mundus Key>
Impossible ledgers? Why?
Where are we exactly?
Crush faces?
How else can I prove I am Undaunted?
I can't say for certain.
<Add <<1>>.>
Who are you?
There are healers at the chapel.
This one's on me.
Have you heard rumor of anything else?
What about it?
So—you were about to tell me where to get a good bruising.
Tell me a story about the seas.
How's that?
Are you a part of Brackenleaf's Briars?
What will you do now?
What exactly is the Viridian Sentinel?
Here. Take the plans.
Yes. Here. Take the plans.
Will I see you again?
Farewell, Sai Sahan.
What were you doing up here?
Try to hold still.
Have you received any reports from Captain Janeve?
Of course, Leila. As you wish.
What else can you tell me about Montclair himself?
What are Warfront missions?
I want to see the Baroness healed with all my heart.
Where did he go to meet the constable?
Where do I go to find <<1>>?
You think knowing would make a difference for Martin?
Where is Darien?
Read something from this book of poetry.
Thank you.
What exactly were Althen's crimes?
What exactly were Althen's crimes?
What can you tell me about those bandits?
She talked about a Mortuum … Vivicus? I don't know what that is.
Thank you.
Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?
Thank you.
What is it that you do?
Tell me about your mace. It has a fancy name?
<Add a gear.>
I'm ready to join up.
I wish to join the Mages Guild, then.
What's the reward?
I'm ready to join up.
Grell doesn't seem to be here.
We'll have to take that risk. You can't settle here.
Erunor said you would tell me about your village.
Attributes: Make a donation
I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild.
Anything I should know about this place?
What do you mean?
You mentioned an Armature?
How did Titus get here?
Slaughterfish don't have gold.
Tell me more about the Star-Gazers.
Why's that?
Why did the Yokudans attack?
And they can't be raised as undead?
What do I get for being a part of the Guild, again?
Anchors? What do you mean?
I'm ready to join up.
Does the Mages Guild know what's happened here?
Can you tell me about the process?
Does it matter what reagents I use?
Is there more to it?
Can you tell me about the process?
So how exactly do glyphs work?
I'm sure there's a lot to learn.
So you get ingredients and recipes—what then?
Does it matter what reagents I use?
What else is involved?
Plants and water? That's it?
Can you tell me about the process?
Is there more to it?
Can you tell me about the process?
So you get ingredients and recipes—what then?
Is there more to it?
I'd like to know about Shada's Tear.
So if I wanted to join the Guild …?
Hermaeus Mora?
Tell me more about Kelmen Locke.
Yes, I'll release you.
What's wrong?
Who is the Learned One?
The First Era? How old are you?
Iron Orcs?
How did a powerful conjurer like you manage to get captured by mercenaries?
Tell me more about how you summoned the atronachs.
All right. Take me to Vulkhel Guard.
All right, I'll do it.
Lead the way.
What happens if I'm defeated?
How did you sail a ship back to port without a crew?
But their claws are sharp as daggers.
Where'd they take her?
Troll food? What do you mean?
Fools? The Scaled Court plans to destroy Craglorn … maybe all of Tamriel.
Maybe Ulfonius is never coming back.
Yes, I want to return to the sanctuary.
What do you think it this place used to be?
I'm untying you now.
What did you lose?
They really use the mortal races to create the mantikoras?
You call yourselves the Five Claws?
What kind of surprises?
You're my … king?
Why was Holstagg crying?
What purpose did these creatures serve?
What have you been doing since last we met?
Is Kelmen really dead?
So, painting is just a hobby for you?
What brings you to Craglorn?
Are you a member of this group?
You seem nervous.
I guess not.
Are all these goods from Cyrodiil?
So, you make a profit from the war?
How do I learn other racial styles?
All right. Why are you a member of the Undaunted?
What did he do?
Is there anywhere I can purchase ingredients?
What if I free the prisoners and just walk away?
The schematics were lost, but the engineer lives.
In the Imperial City.
Daedra, huh?
Do you know what they're planning to summon?
Sure. Just drink the potion.
How did you escape?
Is that how you were wounded?
You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?
Fair enough. What did you do before all this?
What can you tell me about bandit dens?
Who will catch me?
So he's somewhere in the sewers?
What's your mission exactly?
I'll save Lady Sovelle.
Any other way inside besides the locked door?
So why did you marry him?
Are you going to examine the shrine?
Where are Avreg and Zhasim?
So what's Lady Laurent's interest in all this?
What can you tell me about <<1>>?
Wait. Tell me more about the Agra Crun.
What about you? Are you going to Orsinium?
I know where they took the supplies.
What happens now?
I'll go to Fharun Stronghold and meet Eveli.
"Yes sir!"
How can you face Baloth if he does not fight with honor?
Why would the Vosh Rakh imprison you?
I should discuss this with Raynor before I make a decision.
I can kill other Vosh Rakh?
You're going to blame this on High Priestess Solgra?
You won't get away with this.
But something must have inspired the king's bad mood.
What's actually inside the tomb?
So we go to the crematorium and ….
All right. I'll let her know.
How new is this group?
So you don't care who claims the city?
Open the portal.
<Place the tall vase.>
Do you think you could read it if you saw it again?
Can I help?
Praise Malacath, true father of the Orcs!
So you'd prefer to die?
I'll find Jaeloreh, retrieve your documents, and meet you on the road to Orsinium.
Chief Bazrag asked me to give you this.
All right.
Unification sounds like a lofty goal.
Tell me more about the storm.
So, are you ready for this?
What can you tell me about <<1>>?
Tell me more about the demiprince.
Tell me about this fog.
That doesn't sound like a hero talking.
<<1>> gave it to me.
So you and Meram are partners?
Any idea where the fog comes from?
How can I help you, King Kurog?
Is that a good idea?
Bazrag's fine, but I need to know how he was captured.
You stole the mug. Why shouldn't I turn you in?
Why would Shatul fall into chaos without a chief?
Did <<1>> ever fear you would challenge him?
Would that be so bad?
But what do you think of him?
If anyone else swallows a bear's tooth, they're going to look more sickly.
Kurog and Alga. They plan to kill the chiefs and blame you for organizing the Vosh Rakh.
Deal. What should I tell <<1>>?
I'll head there now.
Did King Bazrag talk to you?
You mentioned your husband. Who is that?
So she left you and joined the cult?
Why do you need to do that?
I'll look for your sister at the old Akatosh shrines.
I'm told you know where he keeps his hidden gold.
And that's how you came to the Brotherhood?
Thanks for your help.
Are you always this forward?
I'll pay you to hire her, with enough extra to make it worth your while.
If I compensate you and throw in something extra, will you hire Raynor and pay him for his work?
You look ridiculous.
Tell me what you know about <<1>>. His life depends on it.
You were desperate. You made a mistake. But only <<1>> can forgive you.
Your future husband did that. He framed the Thieves Guild.
How could singing a song be dangerous?
What happened to you after Coldharbour?
Could the Iron Wheel have seen the same notice?
<<1>>, what are you doing here?
Are you all right with how I handled <<1>>?
How many spirits do I need to catch?
It's important to someone, just tell me.
Tell me more about the Enclave of the Hourglass.
I think you should go and talk to her.
What do you mean?
How long has she been working here?
You both have a lot of catching up to do.
Is Tashmin in some sort of trouble?
I can't have you warning the Iron Wheel.
Narahni wants to see you. She looked everywhere to find you.
Why are you and your mother estranged?
Are you all right sharing Narahni with Tashmin?
All right, I'll plant these letters in the Velmont Mansion.
What sort of danger?
What items are we looking for?
Any idea where she might keep such items?
Is Jakarn still pursuing you?
So you're just going to stand around and watch?
You're the only one who isn't hunted by the Iron Wheel.
Speaker Terenus told me to talk to you before I deal with the Governor.
I don't care what you think.
We both have an interest in seeing Nicolas face justice.
What makes <<1>> think there was a traitor?
Who are the merchant lords?
It's some kind of prayer or ritual, maybe. Very poetic.
What if I kill the wrong person?
This had better not be a trick.
You think something may have happened to Hildegard?
Where does Hildegard usually go to pray?
The same Sanctuary that she was ordered to purify?
So you want me to just walk up and kill a random person in cold blood?
I think you've been targeted by the Sweetroll Killer.
You're not worried?
And what matter is that?
Just one?
What about the people here in the hostel?
You think Darien's lost in Coldharbour?
The trader, the baker, the Eye's apprentice. But what about Naryu?
Do you think we can trust her?
That's a problem for another day, I imagine.
That's still pretty tall.
I also found the Black Dragon's journal.
<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>
Ever thought about seeking a cure?
So you could transform at any moment?
You seem nervous. Is everything all right?
We'd be punished for that failure?
Could someone like Lyra ever be forgiven?
Just tell me where we need to go.
Who is my target?
But you aren't in the legion anymore?
Is there anything I can do to help?
What is the Trial of the Arena?
Are you really the Thief constellation?
What can you tell me about this city?
And that is?
What is the significance of the goblets?
Tell me about Klause.
Who is Shada?
Why suspend your search?
Hara wanted us to go inside.
Maybe Hara understood what was happening and tried to give us a clue.
Who are you?
Why suspend your search?
Have they given you a reason not to believe them?
Fools? The Scaled Court plans to destroy Craglorn … maybe all of Tamriel.
He was the High King's friend and he helped cause the downfall of the Nedes?
Any idea what's inside the Arena?
You're part of the Scaled Court?
You mean the Serpent isn't the Serpent?
Any idea who these slavers are?
I'll find Naryu at the overlook.
Thanks. I'll go see her.
I can do that much, but won't your mother be suspicious if I ask about Tirwin?
All right. I'm ready to donate.
Fungal Grotto I: Kings of the Grotto
Like what?
How do we do that?
<Enter the Vaults of Madness.>
I'll find her.
All right. I'll retrieve the evidence and meet you at the mine entrance.
If the Anka-Ra are centuries old, how are they here now? Are they undead?
Where will you go now, Ibaal?
And what happens if he's unable to help?
These notes should be helpful. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Chodala's newfound power might have something to do with Vivec's problem.
What do you suggest we do next?
So you froze him for his own good?
The Forge?
All right. What will House Hlaalu do about this situation?
So slavery through mind-control?
Stormhaven, when you're ready.
Shadowfen, when you're ready.
My partner? I don't have a partner.
Maybe your wife would be willing to discuss that with me.
<Point at Dwarven device.> What is this thing?
An Ashlander named Chodala has been inciting the tribes.
Ashlanders?
Tell me about Veya's disagreement with her father.
Gothren's Mouth, Ralasa Delvi, seemed dead set against it.
Can't you look for a better farmhand?
I'm just trying to help out here. What harm will telling me about Veya's brother possibly cause?
All right, I'll use the staff.
I'm sure. He kept winding up locked in a sarcaphogus.
What do you want me to do?
If you don't let me help, you'll have to deal with others. They're hiring outsiders to find Veya.
Tell me more about Veya's brother.
What does Lord Vivec hope to learn from the divination ritual?
Why didn't you stop these breeding experiments?
Do you think he's planning another escape?
He and some others are planning another escape. It begins in the Vassamsi Mines.
Can I try again?
Lead on and I'll follow you.
And Azri just wants to kill them?
One more thing. How did you get past the guards?
I can put the helmet back where I found it.
Do you often receive writs that call for the death of high-ranking House officials?
Morag Tong rules are that stringent?
Do you think she's in any danger?
What is the Camonna Tong exactly?
You said Khartag's an idiot. Why?
What about the other Daedric Princes? Aren't there more than eight?
Azura mentioned the compact of Sotha Sil again. What do you know about it?
How did you and Eoki meet?
Does the queen know you're impersonating her?
I can handle that.
Do you know where I can find this "Ruddy Man" now?
I hear your reign has been difficult for many of Vos's citizens.
You believe Molag Bal can offer you a cure?
I'll think about it.
Duly noted.
I'll follow your lead.
Anything else you can tell me?
Sotha Sil's tool, is it a weapon?
Tell me more about Beleru Omoril's requests.
Do you get a lot of visitors out here?
Can you tell me anything else about the siblings?
Galgalah is trapped inside Farwen. It was the only way to save her life.
Do you know anything of his plans?
What are you planning?
What brought you here?
If that's true, why aren't you on Artaeum now?
So if someone took over Clockwork City, they could change or even destroy Tamriel?
Is this oil dangerous?
Is this oil dangerous?
How do you keep the stone from blowing up Slag Town?
Is this oil dangerous?
I'll watch for the fabricants on the way to talk to Ohtowen.
Would you still feel that way if I snapped both your legs?
Why did Sotha Sil hide the Clockwork City here?
Are they all like Luciana?
He becomes your enemy?
He wants us to build a lamp—one that's identical to the lamps removed from the loqutorium.
Neramo believes they emit some kind of invisible light.
Thanks for the warning, Kireth.
Is Proctor Luciana still insisting you leave the city?
An aide told me they tossed the old lamps into the Fundament. We should start there.
Is it worth the price?
Yes.
Leave it to me.
So, Precursor, do you know where the rest of your body is?
Why am I looking for notes? Doesn't Oscard use a tabulator?
Who are these Exarchs again?
I'll place the animo core in the machine.
Tell me about the Wraith-of-Crows.
What is the Imperfect?
Wrath, seriously?
How did you and the Exarchs get here?
What do you plan to do with it?
Why will this factotum help with that research?
Who are you really?
I'm sorry to bring bad news, but Orinol is dead.
All right. Is there at least a reward for returning them?
You mentioned an episode? What did you mean?
Can you tell me more about yourself?
Who are these others?
What do you mean by a right fit?
What do you think they want with the Oracle?
How do I break the bindings?
Thanks for the information. Here's something to tide you over.
Do you have any idea where Gascone might have gone?
You want me to go and accuse the Kinlady of conspiring with a Daedric cult?
And the Aldarch agrees with your efforts to protect the island and the newcomers?
I'll meet you at Meridia's shrine.
She didn't seem happy to see you.
A final audition?
What can you tell me about yourself?
Where do I find them?
Is there any other way I might recognize him?
What a spectacle! Let's hear it for Clever, the blade tamer!
You'd really force your brother to join the Sapiarchs against his wishes?
While I cannot speak for Larydel, he will write you once you reach Lillandril.
Other members of the cult mentioned that something was going to happen in Rellenthil.
Where?
So, within legal reason, I can do whatever I want with the place?
What sort of arrangement?
If she stopped working for Halimorion, why would she be here?
How?
So how do I talk to Clavicus Vile?
I think Essence of Mammoth would be perfect for inspiring Enigma's performance.
You should stick with us. It's dangerous to be alone out here.
How can you complain that he's not respecting your wishes, when you refuse to respect his?
Is she always so brusque?
What did you mean when you said that Mirulon aims to bend Arathel's mind?
What's that have to do with Goblins?
Why choose to assist him then?
You won't have any trouble getting him back to the Psijic Order?
I made a deal with Vile to reach the Crystal Tower and Mephala is considering attuning the diamonds.
Rest easy, tower sentinel.
Mephala dragged the Golden Knight into her realm after he dropped this gem.
So what do you suggest I do?
It just seems rather convenient, a voice telling us where to go.
… And?
No.
It seems like you'd have hired more people for a job as dangerous as this.
Do you think the Daedra harmed the Oracle?
What's your role here?
And my reward?
But I thought you were taking records of the wars between High Elves and Goblins?
Tell me more about the items you want Rigurt to acquire.
Who's Justiciar Rolumdel?
Tell me about Sapiarch Tandemen.
So that's it?
I only know that the Dragon abandoned her a long, long time ago.
Why did they imprison you?
Who captured Grog and where can I find him?
All right, I'll go rescue Grog.
Who are you again?
You must have some idea where they're sequestering the newcomers.
All right, I'll help you break this enchantment. I need more details, though. What happened exactly?
Why haven't the Psijics cleared them out?
All right. I'll meet you at the Davon's Watch Mages Guild.
I'll find it.
Who are the Maormer and why did they attack you?
What else could be going on here?
And all three roles are required?
Do you believe that?
She's an artist named Tableau.
What brought you to Summerset?
I can handle Arillas, the Saviors, and whoever else comes to stop us. Just keep your head down.
They exploited a secret entrance only he could open. He was using it to carry on an illicit affair.
Is the island dangerous?
Why would the vandal target you specifically?
I'll hold you to that.
How did you end up here?
You've never tasted beer before?
Why do Arillas and the others call you their Saviors?
If I can ever repay you for your help, let me know.
Are you recovering?
Any ideas on how I should deal with these illusions?
Fine.
So you're a breeder?
You shouldn't have to put up with that.
If you're not so interested in hunting, why not drink with them?
Do you think you'll be able to secure funding?
How can I defeat their shadow replicas?
Is that how she got the treasure?
Why's that important?
I'm sure he'll open up in his own time.
Are there any aprax Elves here in Shimmerene?
Tell her that.
Unpredictable how?
So we need to find the books Hannayel mentioned?
What's your history with the Divine Prosecution, and these two?
I'd like to talk to you about your investigation.
Do you have any idea why?
What kind of rumors?
What is this Augur of the Obscure, exactly?
Remind me, who's Meridia again?
What are you, exactly?
Well, you did just escape Artaeum.
Why are you stuck in a crystal skull?
You said you're bound to tell the truth?
Have any theories as to what we'll find in the Conservatory?
All right. I'll go rescue Grog.
You mentioned a reward?
All right. We'll find Castire and put an end to this.
A pearl?
I'll ask some questions around the city.
Do you know where I can find her?
I'll find Oriandra and get the amplification elixir.
Why do you need me for this? You are the most powerful mages on Nirn.
Can't the other Psijics help you regain your power?
What have you been up to since we stopped that shadow on Dranil Kir?
You think they're still a threat?
Has that worked out?
So someone stole the relics?
Didn't the Ritemaster place protections on the pearl?
Tell me more about the Sapiarchs.
And you want to help us defeat Vykosa?
So Vykosa imprisoned you.
He doesn't seem like a follower of Hircine though.
What did she tell you?
What can I expect within the Wispwood?
What can you tell me about a person named Margus Derius?
Who or what is K'Tora?
Tell me about the Psijic Order.
So what changed?
Are you volunteering?
<Enter Depths of Malatar.>
I'm ready to begin our search.
Kishi's letter mentioned an old training manual.
Good luck. I'll let the Bright-Throats know after I've spoken to the other suitors.
All right, take this and tell me the rest.
Who is Mewah-Jez?
Ready? I guess so.
All right. I'll be right back.
All right. Give me a minute.
What do you mean?
I'd like to help. What is it you need?
Tell me where this cave is located.
What did you do to impress her and secure the deal?
How many balls?
What is this place?
I found this unusual weapon, too. Any idea who it belongs to?
You're going to have to be more persuasive. Is there anything else you can tell me?
All right. I'll tell Famia.
And why are you sending me off to scream?
Maybe so. What can you tell me about the Remnant?
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect to find a Wood Elf tending to an Argonian Temple. That's all.
You think some misfortune is about to befall the ceremony?
If Kishi saved your lives, why punish him for that?
What is Bok-Xul?
Can a necromancer really be killed?
Famia is looking for a treasure called the Kajin-Jat Crystal.
I'm not sure I understand, but thank you for the explanation.
How do I use the fire stones to find Kishi?
Do you know anything about the Swallowed Grove?
Be your eyes? How so?
We should get to know each other better then.
You don't deserve your sister's land. You're the reason she went into ruin.
Nothing.
Where is Famia? Did she leave with Kassandra?
What can you tell me about the Deepmire?
So you help place the grave-stakes where they belong?
That doesn't sound so bad.
Then why are you asking me for help?
You want me to save Kishi and then send him away?
I'll do so. Thanks for your time.
Jaxsik-Orrn and Xukas seem convinced that the Remnant is here.
Kassandra is an unusual name for an Argonian.
And the final frog you need?
Have you never belonged to another tribe?
I'm just trying to understand.
Where can I find Sulosya?
He's in the Bright-Throat Village if you want to see him.
Your traditions make you offensive?
And how are you doing?
Hit the ball into the wall for one point. Lower hoop is three points. Upper hoop ends the game.
So these grave-stakes pin down the dead—they keep them from rising?
And if I can't?
You think they'll accept her?
How would you punish Haxara for what she's done?
We'll see, I guess.
Is this a vision, or is it really happening?
Sounds simple enough.
Tell me about your tribe.
Is this your private viewing spot?
You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk.
Any idea why they took over the Teeth of Sithis?
Why do you describe Famia as persistent?
Thanks for the advice. Any tribes I should watch out for?
Queen Anequina? First War of the Prides?
Yes. Please tell me your part of the story.
Why not talk to Abnur Tharn directly about destroying the weapon?
Who's the Speaker of the Mane?
You said your mother would sometimes hold it and tell you stories. Maybe something she said …?
Why do you need an assistant?
I'll help you relieve Khasda of his wealth.
Euraxia's soldiers reached the ruins before we did. They would have broken the seal eventually.
Perhaps the nearby river is the blue serpent?
That's what I thought.
Any idea where the farmhands may have gone?
Yes. I killed the Betrayer, but not before he set the moons in motion to open the Moon Gate.
How's it supposed to do that?
The Moonlight Blade?
Triangulants? Is that a real word?
All right, I'll head to Tajirri's home and search for clues.
Let's go stop the assassination squad.
You were right. It was Cadwell. He was drawn to an old grave of someone called the Betrayer.
Cadwell agreed to help, but you should know he's been having some strange dreams.
How long has Euraxia been employing necromancers?
It wants Abnur Tharn and me to leave Elsweyr.
Do you think they all mean to do you and the adeptorium harm?
What's so bad about the way you used to live?
And do you believe that?
They have a Dragon as well. That makes escaping difficult.
All right, stay close.
I'll do my best.
We've crossed paths before. She's the enemy of our enemies, but not our friend.
You mentioned someone named Vole?
Tell me about Sunspire.
Why was Sunspire in peril?
And where can I find Sugar-Slinger's den?
Who'd she kill?
You don't sound very confident.
So we've hit a dead end?
But she didn't do anything. It was her ancestor who stole your identity.
I'd like to know who I'll be working with.
So help us fix this, Cadwell. Help us stop the Dragons from reaching Jode's Core.
How does that make the mage more powerful?
He appeared as a small cat.
You said they kill people as well as beasts?
Tell me about the dictated letter you found.
So you operate the siegecraft, too?
Where are they holding Prefect Calo?
How do I know I can trust you?
What do you mean?
How did you survive the execution of the royal family?
And how does collecting mural pieces help with all that?
What are you going to be doing while Nala-do, Khamira, and I deal with the siege weapons?
Why what?
You made them vampires?
If your clan has always been peaceful, why does Rakazsa want them to attack travelers?
Tell me about Cadwell the Betrayer.
Do you usually reward people with collars and bells?
Does Zinthia like all these cats, too?
Guide them how?
So the smugglers were going to make skooma out of the moldy moon-sugar?
What about your daughter Rideza?
I'll go help Captain Nala-do with the supply camps now.
Why was that?
Why can't you just teleport all of us into the palace?
Do you know the significance of the name? The Hidden Moon?
I'd like a blessing too.
I'd like a blessing.
Tell me about the Akaviri.
You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr.
You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave.
I'll go take care of those supply camps.
l'll see you at the Moon Gate.
So you're still with us?
What about the house you were going to build in Coldharbour?
Remind me, why is Euraxia no longer a problem?
And it was you who stole the mural pieces from the House of Histories.
How have things been since I banished the Skooma Cat?
Are you upset that I was the one to kill Phoom?
Good luck, Sereyne.
Why did she have your husband's remains?
Fine. We'll try to perform the cleansing ritual ourselves.
What do the Hollowfangs need him for?
The rise of the new moon is dangerous?
You've been here ever since?
Perhaps these maps will help. They show the location of two Dragonguard sanctuaries.
The Wall of Life?
Let's head for Dark Water Temple right now. (Fast Travel to Eastmarch)
Thank you. I'll see if Za'ji is willing to help.
So now it's an underground fighting arena?
All right, I'll go with Caska to secure your ship.
How many of you are there?
You mean you'll take a new identity, or were you speaking literally?
And you blame yourself for all those things?
I will walk the path.
Why do you want to find a way to battle the Dragons?
Do you want some time to think about it?
It's called aeonstone. The cultists give their life energy to it to empower Laatvulon.
All right, let's head to the New Moon Fortress.
How did you know where to find me?
My patron was concerned over, uhm, unknowns digging in to her business.
Good luck. You two make an interesting pair.
What's the significance of the Horn of Ja'darri?
I'll look for the missing tablet pieces.
Snow lilies?
How did Sai take her departure?
The Horn of Ja'darri?
The cove is full of trapped moonlight?
I'll take my reward either way.
What is this mask? And who's Ja'darri?
Who is Grandmaster Vashu-Pir?
It sounds like you're not very pleased with our Dragon ally.
How will you help?
Have you been able to fight back against the Dragons?
I didn't know that. I'm sorry. You'll have your freedom after we deal with Maarselok.
I'll find the moon-sugar and meet you in Senchal.
Why would the emperor's honor guard also hunt Dragons?
Tell me more about the Dragonguard.
I'll retrieve the last of the gourmet moon-sugar.
I'd like to know more about you.
You said you stole the bell to buy your ship?
Can you describe him?
How do they react to the moons, exactly?
Sounds like a desperate situation.
What did he offer you?
Is there no cure for your affliction?
Was it your mother's voice you heard?
All right. Any idea where I can find this Khajiit, Zurnash?
I'll let Sai Sahan know what we discovered.
Why did the mask fail Ja'darri?
And Tajahir?
Best of luck.
Is Zeira still running things?
Has the tapestry always been here in the palace?
Why have you decided to join us now?
Isn't this a love story?
What was it?
<Enter Falkreath Hold.>
And what about you, Captain Sai Sahan?
And what happens if I get on her bad side?
Is there anything you can tell me?
All right, you can follow me.
I'll take a look.
What can you tell me about your cat, Winks?
What should I tell her about Jano?
You said these caravaners were criminals. What else do you know about them?
So, how will these goods help you and Safik escape?
You'd rather leave again?
Why do you think this special treatment was a burden to Ra'khajin?
Before we go, tell me more about the magic Jorunn's wizards provided. (Do Not Fast Travel)
What do you need me to do?
Where are these dro-m'Athra coming from?
What will you do now that Vijari is gone?
A great hunger? What do you mean?
Open the door and I'll get your flask.
I'm ready.
All right, I'll explore Blackreach and see what I can find out.
Yes, if I had to.
We'll do our best.
Let's head to the temple.
The coven seems interested in the Haafingar hold.
So that's why the soldiers became harrowfiends?
What do you need me to do?
So you've done this before?
What are harrowfiends? And for that matter, who are you?
Let's track him down.
You didn't find any trace of your caravan agent?
Do you think it will work?
What changed?
If we hadn't stopped Svargrim, that might have been necessary.
What else do you need to do out here?
You think those men were trying to hide where they came from?
Tell me about the Icereach Coven.
Sure, I can find the ingredients. How does this potion work?
Wait, wait …
I'm ready.
What makes you think Old Mjolen can help?
But you got along with your mother?
Who is Overseer Thulsgreg?
You really think the Reachmen will attack Dragon Bridge?
I was thinking about our time in the Clockwork City.
Tell me about Thane Hraldi.
You said Freiwen enjoyed visiting the farm?
<Add Shalk Resin.>
Have you found any other survivors?
Have you seen any locations where bandits could hide down here?
Do you think Svana's ready to rule Western Skyrim?
What exactly is the Scraps?
What will these traps do?
The coven isn't acting alone. Someone called the Ashen Lord commands vampires and werewolves.
What can you tell me about the mine?
What did this Pale Man look like?
You mean this Dwarven key?
Tell me about Tzinghalis.
We absolutely do.
Why seal themselves in the Temple of the Divines and the Tower of the Wolf?
I do. I want to join the Antiquarian Circle.
I'll see you there.
How'd you survive?
Do you have any advice for facing the Sea Giant?
Do you think Svana is ready to become the ruler of Western Skyrim?
Good luck in your search.
Good luck.
Do you think this amulet really calmed the storm?
Cross the bridge or sneak in through a sluice gate. Sounds like a clear choice.
What have you been doing in Skyrim?
Tell me about this group you represent.
I'll clear a path for you.
Show us how to get inside and we'll leave you alone. You have my word.
It will take me directly to him?
On the shores of an open sea, hordes of horkers frolic free.
Yes, I want to be one of the Undaunted.
Are you happy we caught Overseer Urlvar?
What ingredients do you need?
Why do you dislike Chief Urzikh so much?
But has the alchemy helped the clan?
Are you willing to put your feud aside and meet with Thane Hraldi and Jarl Morryn?
What happened to Rasir?
The way out is clear. You can escape now.
So you're also a vampire?
You mentioned that Solitude is ignoring you.
Do you know why Maxten brought Freiwen to Kjenstag ruins?
Can you give me an example?
You don't approve?
Can you use the rune magic to end the curse?
Are there any survivors left out there?
Remarkable? You sound like you respect them.
Remind me about the Direnni Elf.
Tell me about the experiments with life energy.
Have you ever heard of the Pyre Watch?
I'll go to the Crypt of the Exiles. Get to Scholar Diel's camp.
I'll go with you to investigate the Gray Host castle.
I want to know more about the kind of work they need accomplished.
What about the ritual has to do with Namira?
Were you two close?
What kind of traps?
So you're going to work with him on this?
No. You need to defend yourselves and keep your people safe. The fewer Reachfolk die, the better.
There's no other way?
What do you think about Jarl Svana?
What do you plan to do?
How are things in Western Skyrim?
He did.
I'll present myself at the ritual pyre.
Isn't the Dark Heart evil?
Could this Darkstorm be related to the harrowstorms of Western Skyrim?
I would like to continue our discussion of an alliance with the mortals later, my friend.
Why don't you and your sister talk any more?
Keep at it. I'll continue looking for Arkasis.
You may find that power, bereft of companionship, does not bring satisfaction.
What need have we for assassins? Death only invites more death.
What do you mean?
Did it work?
The storms aren't natural. Icereach witches summon the storms at the behest of the Gray Host.
What's so important about these letters?
Who's traveling with you?
What about these black infections?
What will happen to the Rites?
An emergency?
I can do that. [Take Old Life Messages]
What should we do?
Lyris Titanborn and Sai Sahan need to hear this story. It may have significance for them.
Where can I get a briarheart seed?
Where can I find these ritual components?
What will they do when this is all over?
Tell me about Adusa-daro.
I'll meet you at your camp.
You like her, don't you?
You seem happy that Madearn's here.
The Spirit Queen?
What about Ard Caddach?
So what do we do?
Tell me more about this vateshran we're going to see.
Then why bother to cleanse Lorkh's shrine?
I'll retrieve the Symbol of Uricanbeg. Where can I find it?
Does that mean you're getting along?
Is that why the search for the Dark Heart is leading us to Nighthollow Keep?
So, you saved the entire clan? They must have been grateful.
So each clan is fighting its own war?
Why are you recruiting outsiders to do this work?
Before the duplicate exploded, it said something about a master.
I suppose Ard Caddach and I have a rapport.
What's been happening in your village?
What did you mean when you said you know the Reachmen have a strong sense of honor?
Tell me more about the cult.
And you don't know what happened to them?
What can you tell me about the Painted Eye?
Your combined forces helped save Sombren and Calia.
So you and Quistley are like brothers?
Do you think this mentor can help Calia and Destron learn to control their powers?
All right.
A complication?
I'm ready.
Tell me about this seed we're searching for.
You really think the Waking Flame cultists are out here?
We found the ring you planned to give to Alizinda before she murdered you.
Lady Twilight?
Dangerous in what way?
Where is this frog pool?
Eveli never mentioned she had a brother before.
When did you last see Annyce?
Secret gatherings?
Your brother thinks you're dead. He's grieving for you.
Who's Mehrunes Dagon?
Why romance, if you don't mind me asking?
Can you tell me about the living Winds?
Yes, we came about Satul-Sa. Wake up!
How many fermented mudcrab apples do you need?
This ritual had better free Yisara too.
She unleashed their power without teaching them to control it? Won't that consume them?
So you don't mind that she's looking into the secrets of the Longhouse Emperors?
Take your time. Then what happened?
What will happen when he reaches this lode?
Wild Elves?
How do we do that?
How many adventurers have you hired?
Let's go.
Can you tell me why you can't access it?
<Enter Rockgrove.>
Are you ready to see the final vision?
What kind of Argonian relic?
So, it's not fully assembled yet?
Why is it called the Keywright's Gallery?
Let's go.
You mentioned a Grand Archive?
Remind me about the secret.
How do we do that?
How do I get to the shrine?
You said you're not from around here. Where did you travel from?
Can you give me the details of the crime again?
Thanks for the tip.
Can't you just tell me what happened to Stibbons?
What will you do now?
Tell me about the Four Winds.
What brings you to Blackwood?
Is Old Deathwart a singing frog too?
But the Deadlands. You'll be walking right into Mehrunes Dagon's realm.
Where's Eveli now?
Do you think he did it? Found an Ambition, I mean?
There was a rope hanging from the ceiling of the watchtower.
Why would the Imperials take your people?
What happened to the relic you broke?
Tell me more about the ritual stone.
Please don't.
How am I supposed to recharge the stone?
Irenni never gave up searching for your puzzle box, but Mirri wants to take over her mother's duty.
You know someone who can help us locate the hidden vault?
What became of the jewels Lady Hallix sent with Bastian?
No, I'll keep my spirit.
What's your plan now?
Why are you sharing this with me?
How can I even be sure that you're really Nocturnal?
You must know more about Leovic's secret and the Ambitions.
What can you tell me about the Sul-Xan attack?
Malosza said you were one of the guards.
You have an alternative?
How fare the other Winds?
Best of luck.
Good luck to you and Gavos.
What's that item supposed to do?
I'm helping the Fighters Guild find a way out of here.
Are you sure your sister didn't join the cult?
Dangerous how?
Who are Jynd and Zynoahz? Tell me about them.
You don't want to search together?
Why is Tephilaz so crucial to Wretched Spire's peace?
He said he had a Perfected Cataclyst. But listen. The Anchorite's memories have been restored.
Elegian helped you escape that fate.
You're willing to trade one of your holy relics?
Tell me more about the jobs Vaveli Indavel offers.
Do you know who Elegian is or why he was imprisoned?
Elegian has something to do with the Anchorite. He made her mask.
We'll meet you at the portal dais.
Do you think that other battlemage was behind all this?
You said something about a pocket realm?
For a time?
Is there anything else you can tell me about the cult?
How did Pibiha get kidnapped by the Waking Flame?
Who are you, exactly?
How is your injury?
Are you uncomfortable working with me?
If any Dremora can sense it, how is it secret?
Hop in my pack, Arox.
But I haven't forgotten about her.
Why do we need those specific vintages?
I assume you have a plan?
Yes, this planestone.
What does that mean?
<Enter <<1>>.>
All right, I'll help with your rescue and recovery mission.
A sundial? What does it do?
I defeated an extremely powerful creature. Your readers should avoid these locations.
I saved Vivec from a plot to drain his power and pass it to Clavicus Vile.
Is there anything you can do to help poor Joset?
What sort of treasure is in the Unmaker's hoard?
Who are the Saraathu Tong?
I'm ready to stop Mehrunes Dagon.
The pain of dying means so little to you?
You should be safe in Fargrave. Mehrunes Dagon can't reach you here.
What will you do now?
They're Dremora transformed into living disasters. We want to destroy the device that creates them.
Now will you tell us where to find Master Rrvenk?
Stop looking for someone to fix your problem and get a hold of yourself.
Why did you make the deal?
I've never heard of you.
And Daedra in Fargrave know the rules?
Rynkyus was sending his Bladebearers to scour the Deadlands for Sister Celdina.
What will you do with Tarvyn?
Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil.
What are the Old Ways?
Why did you hire Robhir?
What kind of fish can you catch in lava?
The Grasp?
What would Mehrunes Dagon want from you?
So, you're basically a glorified messenger?
You're suggesting Nokvroz could have altered time itself?
Did you learn anything from him at least?
That sounds a little ominous.
How do I assist Miksotet's ritual?
You're not going to hurt her, are you?
Does this change your plan to find it?
How do you know about blood magic?
I'll gather the wood you need to weave a basket.
Should we head directly to the abandoned crypts you saw?
Mind if I ask you about the delegates that were aboard the missing ships?
Why is it called Mandrake Manor?
Tell me about the Loch Abhain Shallows.
You certainly lead an interesting life.
All right. I'm willing to help.
Do we talk to the mage, or fight them?
Would you mind if we took your staff?
The paper mentioned a stage at the northern tip.
Why do we need disguises?
Tell me where to find Lady Arabelle and the medallion.
Why is that?
Right. We'll meet at the coin fort.
Stagger and Sway, please.
You saw what they did and you chose to stay?
Tell me more about the locations you want me to investigate.
All right, I'll find you some food from the shore.
If you kill the alliance leaders, how will you achieve peace?
Are serious threats common in the Systres Isles?
How do you feel about joining a new crew?
Sure, I'll help you steal a ship and sail to All Flags Islet.
Why did you call yourselves the knights of Death's Valor?
If it really is Jhaka, do you think the Telvanni are going to give us trouble if we try to free him?
I'll find Prince Irnskar and meet you at Memorial Hall.
If you knew all of this, why haven't you tried to rescue Song yourself?
Thank you, Captain.
Where do you think he'd go in Gonfalon Bay?
He thinks you're smitten with him.
Um, all right.
How do we do that?
You want us to get the wine back?
What are these medallions actually for?
Do you still want to adventure with me?
Right, they want us to get a musical instrument.
You've been through here before?
So the Oaken Order is a druidic group?
It's the Ascendant Order. The inn's patrons said they've been robbing people and attacking caravans.
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
Go on.
So, do I know everything now?
The Emperor making weapons of children is a lot to stomach.
What's in it?
How will the tournament play out?
Your days in Elsweyr?
What kind of trouble?
And what happened to the Redguard?
We'll figure it out, Ember.
So you haven't found the next world-ending threat to deal with?
And some of these ships were wrecked nearby?
What about the restoration ritual we found?
So you're Captain Renwic Moorcroft?
Are all druids this upset?
Why do you call them faceless?
It seems fine now.
Who sponsors these jobs of yours?
Let's play. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)
Can you fix it?
Who sponsors these jobs of yours?
Thank you for sponsoring me.
It's good to see you again, Stibbons.
Why here?
You're a Roister's Club Founder?
What can you tell me about the All Flags Navy?
So, now people just play games in there?
Chapter seat?
What will become of the Dreadsails?
Who else did you commit diplomacy against?
The Ascendant Magus was Count Damard Dufort.
And you think you can get off Amenos on a raft?
How many runes are there?
I'm sorry.
What do you think it means?
Why does this process kill the vessel?
We'll see soon enough.
How did you end up here?
Why were you talking so strangely?
Who is Armin Demalle?
You only found a few purses?
And what does this have to do with finding the missing alliance leaders?
Some vampires aren't so bad.
You're tracking a specific vampire?
Is Silverslip close by?
How do you plan to learn that?
Did they help you here?
What brought you to Steadfast Manor?
What happened during her last voyage?
What did you do in her absence?
I'll meet you there.
Honestly, I thought they were all bad.
My friends over there are spoiling for a good fight. See how they're scowling?
They're just over there. Good luck!
Here you go. The louder, the better.
What are you thinking, Lord Bacaro?
Archdruid Devyric can corrupt the spirits?
All right. I'll use the ballistas to drive off the Sea Elf ships.
All right. I'll tell Sir Stefan what we learned here.
Do you know where we can find Druid Fenas, Octin?
I'll scout the cave and look for the captives.
Sir Stefan Mornard sent me to find these captives.
Voices of the roots?
Alduin.
Tell me about Windwrack Fort.
A second home to you?
Tell me more about Galen.
Do the Stonelore have cities, too?
I'll participate in the training.
Where did the Dreadsails take the everflame torch?
All right, I'll go talk to some imprisoned Sea Elves.
What's on the other side of this door?
I'll go to Clohaigh and check on Frii.
Did you believe the legend?
Archdruid Orlaith knew about you. Does she know about the guardian?
Of course.
Who's Elder Verline?
One wrong move and what?
Do the Stonelore worship at these shrines?
There was nothing we could do to stop the cathedral from collapsing.
Why do you say that?
Are there many Redguard members of the Stonelore Circle?
Are there many Redguard members of the Stonelore Circle?
What happened after she found you?
What's Sealord Nalos's target, then?
Galen? You think the Ascendant Order is hiding on that island?
I overheard Sealord Nalos. He learned where the seed is hidden.
I'm surprised they left any Dreadsails behind. I assumed they'd all be part of the armada.
What do you need to defend the spirit from?
Why does Frii need your protection?
What do you have in mind?
Remind me. What happened in the cathedral?
Why do you think they wanted to take Unu?
So, can I get a bottle of brandy from you, or not?
Where did you get food and wine?
It's getting there. Now just be creative.
You've mentioned your claws twice, what do you mean?
Let's go talk to Quen.
I'll go talk to Druid Ryvana.
Can you prove Averos is guilty?
I will NOT give you the tome
What protections does the Claw have?
Reset battleground.
I will try and find her.
This potion will make you forget your worries.
Where can I find Serge Arcole?
Casilla
Who is Sadir?
Tell me about the Supernal Dreamers.
<Examine the papers.>
Tell me about the Forebears.
You said you were a general?
What do you think we should do?
That's enough. Here is your armor.
Do you have any advice on defeating her?
Tell me about the harpies.
What miracle?
Tell me more about Gabrielle Benele.
Who are the King's Guard?
Tell me about the warrior spirit.
Why are the Mabrigash so isolated?
I'm not afraid of killing more soldiers of Montclair's.
Why aren't the other Dark Elf houses helping you?
Tell me what's going on and I'll let you go.
Where did you go?
Anything else I should look out for in the mines?
Who are the Chimer?
Where should I take this book?
A cage.
What's a lamia?
Wait. I need a moment to prepare.
What can you tell me about the prison?
Why do you think Tanval did this?
You said the invaders mentioned crystals.
Enjoy your stay.
Where did you find me?
What does Tillrani have against you?
Will Feyne leave you if you stay?
Take Feyne back to Narsis.
How'd you escape?
What happened to the rest of your circle?
What kind of creature attacked?
We need to rescue the Silvenar. Let's go.
What is there to do in Windhelm?
What do the cultists want down there?
They didn't see you on their way down?
What is the Worm Cult?
Where can I find Teldur?
You sound tense. Is something wrong?
Let me ask you something else.
Saved the Rift in Harald's age.
His tomb was built upon this lake.
Now on my nose this cake I bake.
Where did you get this key?
Do you miss your command?
What about your husband?
He's a wanted man. By me and others who aren't as pleasant.
What do you mean?
I'm not falling for this again.
Razum-dar said you two were old friends?
Why were you out here?
I want to help and I could use his assistance.
That's madness. Not a chance.
I choose Estre.
Why are you in this place?
This is none of my business. Here, take your things. I'll be on my way.
Have you heard of something called <<Ac:1>>?
Anything else?
I can't help you today.
He poisoned you?
Ten long years you were astray, with sword in hand so far away.
Good idea. I'll be back with him soon.
Can you tell me again about the essences?
What is the Worm Cult?
Who were the Ayleids?
Can we stop the Worm Cult from summoning Mauloch?
How did you make yourself look like a fern?
I already promised it to the mage outside the ruins.

I decided that meditation is not for me, and thought I might take up the study of music. I found an Orc merchant specializing in musical instruments of every type. I asked him for a recommendation. He sold me a blunt instrument and told me to knock myself out. I was a half day's ride from him before I got the joke.
As I gathered components for this delivery, I got to thinking about moths. Why do you only see them at night? I'm not saying that they're vampire butterflies, but I started carrying extra toothpicks, just to be safe.
Ducked into a tavern to get out of the rain and have a hot meal. The food was terrible and the service was worse, but I honestly didn't mind. It made me feel better about not having enough coin to leave a tip. Your components are enclosed.
Here are your provisioner components. I will make this letter brief, as I have come down with an infuriating case of the hiccups. In an effort to scare myself, and thus relieve my condition, I am planning to enter a crypt that is reportedly haunted. Wish me luck.
My friend, I have wondrous news! I am in love! She is a dainty, sweet thing, full of caring and honesty, and she has the bluest eyes I have ever seen! I may propose marriage this very night! A selection of quality components is enclosed.
A hooded stranger appeared in the dead of night. I knew I could trust him, for he bore a tattoo like mine. He gave me a scroll bearing the name of a local villager and told me he was a Mark, although the name on the scroll was Farfal. I promised that I would pay this Mark Farfal a visit, and give him the regards of the Morag Tong.
Traveling with another caravan, this time Baandari traders. I don't think these Khajiit like me. I've never been a cat man. I grew up with dogs. I think the Khajiit can tell this with one glance. One nasty, sidelong, vindictive glance. Your delivery is enclosed.
Here are your provisioner components. Interesting day. I got into a tavern fight. I really gave him a good shot to the knee with my chin, then got blood all over his fist, with my nose. That will teach him.
Your next delivery is enclosed. I met a woman named Helga, and we had a torrid love affair that lasted all night. When we awoke and I gazed upon her in the light of the morning sun, she looked deep into my eyes and told me she wants to get married. I hope she meets someone nice.
Here are your components. I don't know why, but I seem to attract traveling companions that never stop talking. And the whole time all I can think is that I wish they'd finish so I can tell my own story that's not just better, but also directly involves me.
Another shipment for you, friend. I hope my brother Ezdab handled the last package well. He is an oaf and a fool, and though both oafs and fools have their uses, they are prone to mucking about. Forgive me. I do not mean to share my sibling misgivings with you, but I only have so much ink and a single parchment, and the words wrote themselves.
Esteemed employer, may these components avail you. I hope you fare as well in your journeys as my brother and I. Never fail to keep up with your enchanting! It could save your life! We would hate to lose you.
Honored employer, this is Ezdab, brother of Abnab who writes to you. Along with the letter comes our latest shipment. Use it well, for there may not be another coming. My brother has disappeared. I do not wish to trouble you, nor do I think you can help--by the time this reaches you, if Abnab has not been found, likely it will be too late.
Esteemed employer, I have sent you a package. It is full of the components of your dreams. Once again, I have sweat and fought and bled for them. Have you ever considered doing the same for me? I'm not bitter--but I can see through everything. And I do mean everything, like it's made of glass. Not malachite glass. Looking glass. It's terrifying.
<<1>>,\n\nGreetings from Grand Warlord Sorcalin. As one of the Dominion's finest Champions, you are hereby granted the following reward. May it aid you in the battles to come!\n\nFireluin,\nScribe to Grand Warlord Sorcalin
Anvil is an odd place. Everyone knows raiding bands keep gold flowing through the port. It's always rougher when their boats return, but the locals are mostly immune. Even the meanest dogs are loathe to foul their own nests. A curious balance, but they seem to keep it.
The Dark Elf vessel—the Graceful Netch—stopped briefly in Rivenspire. Blood fiends and civil war is all anyone could talk about in Northsalt Village. Also, strange happenings in the nearby city of Northpoint. I don't know the details, but I recommend avoiding uncivil blood fiends should you visit. For me, it's on to Vvardenfell.
Though Khajiit sound harmonius to each other, Pacrooti's other friends say that Khajiiti singing sounds like the scraping of two rocks against glass. Pacrooti swears he has a voice like an Elvish bard of old after an ale or two. Enjoy your components. Though Pacrooti tried, the components were not paid for by Pacrooti's singing in the street.
Please make good use of these components, dear friend. Pacrooti had to fight a terrifying Dwarven machine to get to them. No one in town had any. Pacrooti checked everywhere. Including the houses.
I shared a fire with a camp of Argonians. After a few cups of some foul-tasting beverage they obviously enjoyed more than I did, they loosened up enough to tell me about a ruin they had passed in their travels. Finally, a real lead to a dungeon! But don't despair. I won't neglect my duties to you while I delve into the unknown.
Here you go. I hope this suffices, but I didn't want to range too far afield while Narsis Dren is visiting the city. He is my hero, after all. I plan to be just like him! Well, maybe half as good. He is the preeminent dungeon explorer of our time, so I need to set my sights accordingly. I'll tell you all about his talk next time.
By all the snow in the Nine Holds, I can't believe what my brothers have done to me! Do you know why they called me home? Do you know what we're celebrating? My marriage! Oblivion take the horkers, I don't want to get married! I'm just furious about this! Oh, and here are your components.
I met the most interesting Argonian. A traveling alchemist, Aleet-Uka. I encountered him on the road, beside his small cart with its potions and reagents. We got to talking and realized we were heading in the same direction, so he invited me to accompany him. After that incident with the circle of stones, I find the lizard's presence comforting.
I followed Plucky as he chased the rabbit, but a strange noise ahead gave me pause. I drew my weapon and approached, using what cover I could to conceal my presence. From my hiding place, I saw a sight that made my blood run cold. Daedric cultists! Three robed figures tossed nets over both Plucky and the rabbit. And the day had started so well.
Ilton Beran is an infuriating little man. Small even for an Elf, he carries himself as though he were a giant. And does he love the sound of his own voice! I came close to driving a dagger into my ear on multiple occasions, as he went on and on about one obscure fact after another.  But eventually he got to the subject I originally asked about.
I'm drowning my guilt in mead. I didn't help Little-Leaf, but I also decided not to warn the merchants, either. Now I feel guilty about doing absolutely nothing! Karamel succeeded at robbing the bazaar. She smiled and blew me a kiss before she disappeared into the wilderness. I hope I see her again. I miss her already.
Plucky and I have sneaked up on a camp not far from where I think the ruins of Bthunzel are located. It's worse than I imagined! I found Karamel Little-Leaf—and she's sharing a drink with Morella the Cruel and her thugs! I guess our meeting at the bazaar wasn't an accident. It appears the Wood Elf thief works for Narsis Dren's nemesis!
Congratulations, your Argozog has arrived! Your new friend can be found sunning himself in your Collections window. Have fun on your adventures!

Sitting in the holding cell, I overheard the local guardsmen talking about a shocking development. Murder is a blow in any community, but the death of someone in a small town rattles everyone there. With my experience as a tracker, and the keen eye of a provisioner, I offered my assistance.
The cat-men of Elsweyr are a friendly lot, and their procurement agents are no exception. Unlike other cultures that speak broadly about food, the Khajiit sample their wares as they show them off. As part of the conversation, I must as well. If I can manage to stand up tomorrow morning, I shall have some lovely items to send your way.
I feared that poor Snips had contracted Llodos plague, but despite my egg-brothers' protests to the contrary, my mudcrab never turned into a ravenous monster. He remains his usual ball of cuddles and coos, even if he seems to be as sad as a willow tree in a desert. So, we're on our way to Eastmarch to find the alchemist Aleeto.
Veesk again. Turns out, I was worried about nothing. Alchemist Aleeto might be a bit rough and a little crazy, but she knows how to mix elixirs and concoctions. Now, her soothing stomach potion smelled like Nord socks and tasted like guar dung before she added a few drops of jute root, but it settled my insides. And she's teaching me to make it!
Before we parted ways, I shared an idea with Makes-Many-Soups to make her cooking fire better. I suggested she add a second or even a third pot. That way, she can prepare more than one soup at a time and give her patrons a choice. "More than one soup at a time?" Makes said, stroking my head fin. "I must consider this radical approach carefully."
My egg-brothers devour every page I write, eager to see what the Green Hood and his paramour, Makes-Much-Love, do next. At this point in the tale, Makes has been taken captive by the slavers, while the evil Duvariin Dres has sent her necromantic creations to destroy the Hood—and all of Mournhold in the process! And that's as far as I've gotten ….
We talked for hours around her campfire. I explained my ideas for the further adventures of the Green Hood and how he would find an ally in a daughter of House Dres, demonstrating that not every Dark Elf is a villain. So that I had the time to write all these adventures, I told her I needed someone to service the clients in my component business.
Fahdah the Eyeful. She's a Redguard brawler whose brawn is matched by her stunning beauty. I've had the opportunity to watch her work as an interested bystander and her beatings are legendary. She accomplishes more with a look and a snarl, however, than most thugs can even get close to with a barrel full of weapons. I hope the healer can help her!
Can Margog the Hammer become Margog the Serene? That's what the priest of Mara says is my best hope for a happy existence. She wants me to ignore my violent impulses. She says I should stop using rude and obscene language. That I should look for the beauty in all things and endeavor to be more friendly. This might just kill me, but I'll try.
It's me, Margog the Hammer. I've lost two shipments of smuggled goods in as many days because of those brigands working for Splendid-Paws the Khajiit crime lord. Well, enough is enough! I'm taking a few of my employees and we're going to find these brigands. And when we do, I'm going to serenely and calmly beat them to bloody pulps!
Margog the Hammer again. Along with this batch of material, here are more details on the bantam guar house I'm building behind my tavern. It's got four entrances, two exits, three levels, and an exterior deck so the guar can sun themselves. I'm also adding two feeding troughs and three fountains so there's plenty of food and water to go around.
I was beginning to think the whole ritual thing to summon a representative of the Dark Brotherhood was some kind of prank to make me look silly, but no sooner had I finished reciting the words than a figure in a black-hooded robe stepped out of the shadows. "Who do you need dealt with, petitioner?" the hooded figure asked.
I thought that Splendid-Paws would have put up a fight. Maybe get himself killed trying to escape from Constable Chedric and the long arm of justice. But no. Instead, the crime lord held up his arms and stated simply, "Splendid-Paws yields, law-enforcer." He gave me a pointed look as the constable's deputies led him away.
I started another woodworking project. It feels good to have a saw and hammer in my hands again. Sometimes the life of an entrepreneur is too busy and there's no time for the things I love. But this project should keep me occupied. I'm going to build a keepsake chest, carved with scenes from popular legends and stories. It's a great idea!
After much deliberation and soul-searching, I decided to go with the story of "The Brave Little Scrib" as the carving on my keepsake chest. It's such a heart-warming and uplifting tale! I enlisted Kwela to help me. She's a remarkable artist. I'll use her illustration as the basis for the carving. If it turns out well, maybe I'll make another one.
I hope you are well. Mother says that maybe you do not make swords at all. May be you make armor. I like swords, but armor is good too. - Aksel Rockbiter
Narasgi is very good to me. She is teaching me to write better. You may have seen that writing is hard for me. But no more! I will still get supplies for you, never fear! - Aksel
It is me, Aksel. Narasgi taught me to spell the right way. I am very proud. I hope you enjoy your supplies very much. - Aksel
I am happy, Narasgi is happy, Mother is mad. I hope you are happy not mad. Mother yells when she is mad. You do not yell at me. That is why I like you. Plus the monies you send me. - Aksel
Aksel here. We are talking again. Narasgi and me. She wants to get married right away. Mother says we should wait. I have to go lie down and think. I hope it does not hurt too much.
Narasgi is mad at me. She says I must find supplies for two blacksmiths but I can stop finding supplies for the others. I am happy. I was getting very tired. You are one of the two of course. - Aksel
Have I told you about Estelle? She is one of the servants at Castle Ravenwatch. She does everything around the castle--she cooks, she cleans, she mends our cloaks. I hesitate to mention, but she also provides a service beyond the call of duty. I will not bore you with the details, but without her, life at the castle would be much more difficult.
I'm not sure how it would have turned out, but Jakothon and I did not fight that day. While we were in the midst of exchanging harsh words and harsher insults, a pack of mindless bloodfiends emerged from the darkness behind the Resolute and fell upon him with savage gusto. With a sigh and despite our differences, I decided to save the Resolute.
Do you think it's too soon to see Lyam again? Would it be too forward of me to call upon him? To throw myself upon him and ravish him with sweet kisses? I feel like a school-girl and it feels wonderful! Gwendis claims all the credit, but I think my wit, charm, and beauty had something to do with Lyam's reaction.  But here are more components.
I'm here, outside the Crestshade Mine, and there's no sign of Jakothon the Resolute. I'd say it isn't like him to be late, but I really don't know the man very well. Wouldn't you imagine that someone who calls himself a Resolute would be punctual? You see my point. I'll wait a bit longer. Just to be polite. Here are more materials for your use.
A tall, gaunt man in flowing robes emerged from the mine and approached me. "You must be Lady Melina Cassel of House Ravenwatch," he said with a smooth yet cheerless smile. "Allow me to introduce myself. I am Mazular al-Abec, and I am in need of an enchanter." If this rings alarm bells for you, patron, Imagine the noise resounding in my head!
<<1>>,\n\nGreetings, brave Champion. Accept this reward on behalf of the Covenant. Grand Warlord Dortene appreciates your efforts. Now back to the battlefield!\n\nGrulzul,\nScribe to Grand Warlord Dortene
This one is pleased to say that he has no enemies, but he will admit that he is intensely disliked by his friends.
Zukki is writing from the party. It is a most boring affair. When this one is the most interesting person in the room, it is time to leave. But, Zukki's wine glass keeps being refilled by a serving girl, so he has decided to see how intoxicated he can get and how many people he can mock.
Why I never, those ill-mannered Covenant have started making mocking calls at poor Granny on the road. ''Caw, Caw!'' ''Caw, Caw!'' The nerve! If they aren't careful One-Eyed Tom is gonna pounce them good.
Discerning Customer, your opinions are important to Granny Gravius and especially to this one. If you could find the time to complete your satisfaction survey it would mean the world to us. An extra cookie has been included for your high esteem.
Granny finally gave that lizard-bird what was coming to it, pretended to nod off this evening and sure enough the chicken-livered beast came swooping down to have a peck of ole Granny. That's when she gave that pesky critter a solid wack on the head, climbed down to give it one last kick, and took some plumage too, for good measure.
Granny's almost to the Ashlands, so she figures couriers will be hard to come by. She's sent word back to her place of business to make sure her favorite customer's well taken care of. Don't you worry none about old Granny, she's not going to let any overcooked patch of dirt get the best of her.
I wonder what you'll make from my latest shipment? Perhaps a lovely fire staff, or a strong, solid shield! Why, the possibilities are endless. I hope whatever you make helps you throughout your adventures.
The Redguards are often thankful for the meat I bring in, and I'm more than happy to share with them. Last night they offered me a bowl of their stew, which I of course politely declined. Naturally, I've never eaten vegetables, so I can't say I dislike them from personal experience. But the very smell of cooked Green turns my stomach.
Urbek started smashing book on smashing. Much as Urbek hate to admit it, Little Chief Laumont teach Urbek a lot. Urbek approach smashing metal like smashing rocks and there a lot more to smashing than that. Urbek put that in foreword.
With great regret, we at Velothril Sisters must inform you of the demise of our employee, Valgus. Please accept this delivery from our reserve. We have assigned our employee Gaereleth to handle your account from this point forward. We offer our apologies for this inconvenience.
Please accept this hasty delivery. It seems I am being hunted! The magister has placed a bounty on me for borrowing an ultimately useless Mages Guild book. I ask your pardon for wrapping the delivery in my own wanted posters, but I had already torn down so many of them, and I am not the kind of person to let things go to waste.
Success! I used a thimble of blue-colored oil and some agitating oxide to create a mage's wick, a candle-sized flame that burns a bright white-blue for days. While it burned, I noticed some white-blue ink in the margins of Davamin's journal. He must have used ink to hide his thoughts in plain sight! Now, to investigate.
Eron Salt's fate matched what I said to her. This isn't the first time someone's words resulted in someone's death. Davamin annoyed Eron Salt, and it appears her offhand wish for his demise came true. It's as if they were covered in kindlepitch, and the wish for their death was a lit torch. If words throw the torch, what spreads the kindlepitch?
This one wishes the other Khajiit would just leave him alone. Zukki swears, one day he will snap and strangle one of them. He is reminded of the old Khajiit saying, 'You can attract more flies with honey ... if you pour it over a dead body.'
We have come a long way, my friend. When we saved my foster-brother Quistley from the Daughter of Sithis, I never imagined where our road would lead. Dark dangers and hard-won victories, mystic Eyevea, even a reunion with a sister I thought long dead. Through it all you have been the truest comrade I could ask for. \n\nI have never been good at talking about such things, so let me simply thank you with a token of our friendship. My old tutor Thierren gave me this medallion when I earned my staff. It depicts Julianos, patron of mages. I have always regarded him as my protector, and I hope he will watch over you as well. In years to come, let it remind you of our journeys together.

Hey so … you know I'm bad at this stuff. But just for you, I grabbed a quill and decided I'm writing down my feelings. Ugh, yuck. \n\nEver since that day at the tower, I've been watching you. Not in a creepy way, I swear! I've just been trying to understand. Why me? \n\nI still haven't figured it out. Most people get sick of me by now. But you haven't. And you also happen to be one of just a clawful of people, ever, to keep things interesting. That's pretty amazing.\n\nI tucked in a little gift. A joke, kinda. But when I saw it, it made my eyes go wide and my tail frizz up. And you do too. So. Here you go, or whatever.\n\n- Ember\n\nPS: Yes, I stole it. No, that doesn't make it any less special.

The Clockwork City, also known as Sotha Sil, after its creator, is said to be a great and intricate mechanism that duplicates the mythic structures of Nirn in metallic miniature. Only Seht himself knows its true purpose.
Also known as Pellitine, this land's complex history stretches back into antiquity. Long ago, Khajiiti aristocrats ruled the southern kingdoms with grace and refinement. Now, in the wake of the Knahaten Flu, criminals, Imperial remnants, and Khajiiti patriots all compete for the reins of power.
An ever-changing landscape of fire and storm, of disaster personified and unending destruction, this is the domain of Mehrune Dagon, Prince of Ambition and Lord of Flood and Flame.

I've freed your guards.
Walks-in-Ash said the Covenant has attacked here, and sent me to help.
How did you get here before me?
The Shadowscales have defeated the Dominion at Murkwater.
<<1>> sent me. These supplies are for you.
Your father's in the tower with the Daedra Lord. It's a long story.
I closed the Daedric portals.
Your family is safe, Gjakil.
I killed him.
What will you do now?
Where have they gone, Aera?
We held?
I completed the tasks for the Argonian and Dark Elf leaders.
Your brother sent me to find you.
They've sealed the ruins. No one can get in or out.
What will we do about Thorulf?
I was proud to do my part.
Is this Jorunn's Stand?
All right. If you insist.
Pay up. I beat your record.
That's it?
I dropped them off.
When will I speak to you again?
Tanion is dead.
I've done all that you've asked.
It's not really my business.
Yes, <<1>> is dead.
Very well, I'll help you.
I have something for you.
Yes, and I brought back some of your valuables.
Was the Eye destroyed?
The bargain with the Toothmaul tribe is void. Nelanya was driven off.
You suppose? Isn't that good news?
<<1>> sent me to help you with your problem.
This the crown you're looking for?
I've recovered a horn we can use to control these spirits; we can use them to fight the cult.
Then it worked?
I bring a petition. Chief Tazgol wishes to join the Daggerfall Covenant.
What is the Heart of Valenwood?
But she's coming with Andur to destroy you.
What now?
Drillk, I need that keystone.
What should we do now?
What about the corruption in the trees?
I have a list of supplies that Leono needs.
What happened?
Thank you, Feluni.
Here's the skooma.
What shall I do with the matriarch's body?
The people you were paid to look for are all dead.
Thank you, Jofnir.
Glad I could help.
You are the master to which the Hollow are only copies.
Pellingare deserves a chance. He goes to trial.
I have news about your cousin.
I'm ready.
What will you do now?
The undead are gone from the ruins?
Will you take her back to Evermore yourself?
I'm sure the people still believe in you.
I'm sure the people still believe in you.
Not really. But I fulfilled the contract.
<Post Report>
<<1>> will no longer be a problem.
Is something wrong here?
<Inspect the Body.>
I have a request here from Bangkorai Garrison for more men.
It's been a long journey.
What's the word, soldier?
I dealt with the Maulborn, but I think their plans go way beyond the Serk.
Are you concerned about the Valenwood?
Just as in Camlorn, fire made Faolchu vulnerable.
This book may help.
I've explored Hel Ra Citadel and defeated the opponents within.
Yes, they were collecting nirncrux. I defeated someone called Arnoth, a Scaled Court exarch.
That won't happen. Braadoth is dead and the process has been disrupted.
What have I earned for destroying the Engine Guardian?
I do.
Give me what I've earned for liberating Whisper Grove.
What have I earned for besting the Vaults of Madness?
I accept certification.
An Elven mage was behind the ruin's defenses. He's no longer a threat.
Just exile Neramo and the constructs and be done with this.
Azrath said to give you this. The sacred words of Malacath.
Chief Bazrag is safe. You have my word on that.
Did I earn a reward?
<Sign the Manifest.>
Sure. What now?
<Sign the Manifest.>
<Sign the Manifest.>
<Sign the Manifest.>
<Sign the Manifest.>
Yeah. Here's your stuff.
Your husband wanted to make sure you were safe.
<Sign the Manifest.>
<Sign the Manifest.>
What is the next step for the Thieves Guild?
What's the score on the sepulcher heist?
I fulfilled the stipulations of a contract.
Governor Fortunata is dead.
Is there anything else you need right now?
I completed a contract.
I broke into a lockbox.
I completed a contract.
I completed a contract.
The Sacrament is fulfilled.
The Sacrament is fulfilled.
The Sacrament is fulfilled.
I found this blackened gem inside a Dwemer orrery, but I can't read the writing.
Yes, they were collecting nirncrux. I defeated someone called Arnoth, a Scaled Court exarch.
Yes. Savarak won't trouble the people of Vos any longer.
What has foiling the Kinlord's escape earned me?
What have I earned for destroying the Engine Guardian?
I'm ready for it.
"Celebrations?" There are more than one?
Plan? They tried to kill you!
I have this artifact for you.
You tricked me into delivering poisoned food.
You might want to lie low for a while, Sun-in-Shadow.
Here are the relics I recovered.
Is it really wise to let Stibbons read the Mad God's scrolls?
I'm interested in taking a job.
I have the <<zA:1>>.
If the people want the harvest, let them help by willingly sacrificing themselves.
I know, but we're making progress, Varuni.
Thank you, Brengolin. I'm sure I will.
What's happening now?
That book should fill you in on the details, but for now we must leave.
I've decided to accept your offer.
I've decided to accept your offer.
The Maormer may have gotten the best of him, but it was Pandermalion's plan that saved the day.
Is there anything I can do to help restore your missing memories?
I've decided to accept your offer.
Are you ready for me to set out?
So I need to place more Psijic Seals to discover the remaining fragments?
I destroyed at least three of the abyssal geysers.
I'm with you. Do you have a plan for stopping the Dragons?
Someone was going to be executed?
Another honor?
What's my reward for cleansing Moongrave Fane?
The guardian is dead and I retrieved the notes.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that. But, Bjora seemed important to the Reach.
Here are the ingredients we gathered from the cave.
Yes, she taught me how to use the antiquarian's tools.
So Karthwasten is safe now?
I gathered the mushroom samples.
You said something about a map to Baron Zaudrus.
I am. Tell me what to do.
May I have my drink now?
Something for me? What is it?
Do you wish to go to Wayrest with Clairene?
Should we escort your mother home?
I saved the torchbugs from Undertow Cavern.
He thought he was helping and things just spiraled out of control.
I washed <<1>> clean like you asked.
What's my reward for besting Shipwright's Regret?
The leaders and I defeated the Ascendant Magus. We used the siege weapons and stopped the storm.
Here's your scepter, Rigurt.
I claimed this from Fleet Queen Taleria.
Here's the map fragment.
I disrupted one of the volcanic vents.
I found and destroyed the stolen alliance uniforms.
What's my reward for burying Graven Deep's undead?
What about the Ascendant Order, Lady Arabelle?
How do you think we should proceed, Sir Stefan?

To enter the Player Menu, press <<1>>.\n\nThe Player Menu <<1>> houses various menus such as Character, Inventory, Campaigns, Social, Game Options, Quest Journal, Collections, and Crown Store.\n\nAs you expand each menu found in the Player Menu <<1>>, various submenus will appear. Exploring all of the menus and submenus will reveal a variety of options and game system mechanics.
The Character Menu gives you the ability to customize and view your character's Health, Magicka, and Stamina attributes. \n\nWhen you have an Attribute Point available to spend, navigate to the Character Menu from the Player Menu <<1>> to spend your Attribute Point.\n\nWhen you decide which attribute you wish to improve, highlight the desired choice and press the |t64:64:EsoUI/Art/Buttons/Gamepad/PS4/Nav_Ps4_LS_Right.dds|t to the right to add a point to that Resource type.
While in the In-Game View mode, you can select any item previously loaded into a Quickslot Wheel by pressing and holding the <<1>> key and using <<(UTILITY_WHEEL_GAMEPAD_CYCLE_LEFT)>> and <<(UTILITY_WHEEL_GAMEPAD_CYCLE_RIGHT)>> to select the desired Quickslot Wheel and to click your selection. When you release the <<1>> key your selection will be available for quick use in combat by pressing the <<1>> key.
Dungeons will scale to the level or|t48:48:EsoUI/Art/Tutorial/Gamepad/gp_playerMenu_icon_champion.dds|tChampion of the group leader unless entered via the Grouping Tools. The Grouping Tools will place you in a group of other players and scale your group, and the dungeon, to a predefined level.
In your travels, you will notice that Tamriel Guards enforce the law. If you are witnessed committing crimes such as theft, pickpocketing, and breaking and entering your Infamy will increase. If your Infamy Meter gets high enough, you may face the ultimate punishment—death.  \n\nTrack your character's Infamy levels using the Infamy Meter (pictured below). Every time your character is witnessed committing a crime, your |cFFFFFFBounty|r| and |cFF0000Heat|r| increase within your Infamy Meter.
The Activity Finder allows you to easily locate things to do. This includes both single player and group activities. \n\nTo access the Activity Finder, press <<1>>, select |t48:48:EsoUI/Art/TreeIcons/gamepad/gp_icon_activityFinder.dds|t |cFFFFFFActivity Finder|r.
The Alliance War Skill Line Bonus allows you to gain bonus Rank Points for the Alliance War Skill Lines (Assault and Support) while participating in Alliance War and Battleground activities.\n\nAlliance War Skill Line Bonus consumables can be acquired through multiple means, including crafting. You can use them directly from Inventory or add them to Quick Slots. \n\nOnce used, they grant the bonus for Alliance War activities that generate Alliance Points. The bonus is applied only to Skill Line gain and Alliance War Rank. It does not grant additional Alliance Point currency, nor alter leaderboard or Emperor progress.
You cannot use most raw resources you obtain from gathering in crafting. You must first refine them into a usable material.\n\nTo refine raw resources into materials that you can use for crafting, interact with a crafting station by pressing the <<1>> key. Then, click the Refine icon on the top bar of the crafting menu. Select the raw material you wish to refine, and press the <<2>> key to confirm the refinement.\n\nBy holding down <<2>>, you can continuously refine more of the raw resource, until you run out.
